 ATTACHMENT 1 THE URBAN VILLAGE ELEMENT

 Discussion:

 Seattle is prepared to embrace its share of the Puget Sound region's growth. To ensure that it remains a vibrant and healthy place to live, Seattle has planned for the future of the city as a whole and for each neighborhood that is expected to grow and change. The City will use these plans to shape changes in ways that encompass the collective vision of its citizens.

 This plan envisions a city where growth: helps to build stronger communities, heightens our stewardship of the environment, leads to enhanced economic opportunity and security for all residents, and is accompanied by greater social equity across Seattle's communities. The City has made a commitment to growing wisely, to growing in ways that ensure a livable future, and to growing sustainably. Growing sustainably also means building on the city's successes.

 Seattle's successes include its neighborhoods. Seattle, at the beginning of the 21st Century, has a large number of appealing mixed- use neighborhoods, which serve as the cores of broader communities. Areas as diverse as Lake City, Columbia City, Uptown, and Georgetown provide goods, services, housing, and employment to Seattle's residents and are the key to Seattle's livability.

 Seattle's strategy for accommodating future growth and creating a sustainable city builds on the foundation of these neighborhoods and brings together a number of tools to create a better city:

 * Diverse housing and employment growth,

 * Pedestrian and transit-oriented communities,

 * The provision of services and infrastructure targeted to support that growth, and

 * Enhancements to the natural environment and the city's cultural resources.

 Together, these tools form the urban village strategy.

 As Seattle's population and job base grow, urban villages are the areas where conditions can best support increased density needed to house and employ the city's newest residents. By concentrating growth in these urban villages, Seattle can build on successful aspects of the city's existing urban character, continuing the development of concentrated, pedestrian-friendly mixed-use neighborhoods of varied intensities at appropriate locations throughout the city.

 A. Urban Village Strategy

 Discussion:

 Urban villages are community resources that enable the City to: deliver services more equitably, pursue a development pattern that is environmentally and economically sound, and provide a better means of managing growth and change through collaboration with the community in planning for the future of these areas. The urban village strategy is a comprehensive approach to planning for a sustainable future. This approach is intended to maximize the benefit of public investment in infrastructure and services and promote collaboration with private interests and the community, to achieve mutual benefits.

 The urban village strategy tries to match growth to the existing and intended character of the city's neighborhoods. Four categories of urban villages recognize the different roles that different areas will play in the city's future:

 1. Urban centers are the densest neighborhoods in the city and are both regional centers and neighborhoods that provide a diverse mix of uses, housing, and employment opportunities. Larger urban centers are divided into urban center villages to recognize the distinct character of different neighborhoods within them.

 2. Manufacturing/Industrial Centers are home to the city's thriving industrial businesses. As with urban centers, Manufacturing/Industrial Centers are regional designations and are an important regional resource.

 3. Hub urban villages are communities that provide a balance of housing and employment, generally at densities lower than those found in urban centers. These areas provide a focus of goods, services, and employment to communities that are not close to urban centers.

 4. Residential urban villages provide a focus of goods and services for residents and surrounding communities but may not provide a concentration of employment.

 Each of these areas is intended to see growth and change over time, and together they will accommodate the majority of the city's growth over the life of this plan. The City will continue to work with its residents, businesses, and institutions to promote conditions that will help each of its communities thrive, but will pay special attention to those areas where the majority of growth and change is expected.

 Policies in this element and the Neighborhood Planning Element provide direction for that change and growth. In addition to designating urban villages and defining conditions desired within them, the plan addresses conditions outside these areas.

 Areas outside urban villages will accommodate some growth in less dense development patterns consisting primarily of single-family neighborhoods, limited multifamily and commercial areas and scattered industrial areas. The strategy of focusing future development in urban villages continues to direct new development away from Seattle's single-family areas.

 GOALS

 UVG1 Maintain and enhance Seattle's character as the city grows and changes. Seattle's character includes its built environment: large areas of detached single-family houses both inside and outside of urban villages, many thriving multifamily areas, mixed-use commercial areas, industrial areas, major institutions, and a densely developed downtown with surrounding high-density neighborhoods. Seattle's character also includes its setting on Puget Sound, its lakes and mountain views, its hills and watercourses, and its many parks and open spaces.

 UVG2 Respect Seattle's human scale, history, aesthetics, natural environment, and sense of community identity as the city changes.

 UVG3 Implement regional growth management strategies and the countywide centers concept through this Plan.

 UVG4 Promote densities, mixes of uses, and transportation improvements, that support walking and use of public transportation, especially within urban centers and urban villages.

 UVG5 Direct the greatest share of future development to centers and urban villages and reduce the potential for dispersed growth along arterials and in other areas not conducive to walking, transit use, and cohesive community development.

 UVG6 Accommodate planned levels of household and employment growth. Depending on the characteristics of each area, establish concentrations of employment and housing at varying densities and with varying mixes of uses.

 UVG7 Accommodate a range of employment activity to ensure employment opportunities are available for the city's diverse residential population, including maintaining healthy manufacturing and industrial areas.

 UVG8 Accommodate the City's existing and future housing needs through maintenance of existing residential neighborhoods and the creation of new residential neighborhoods. Encourage housing development so that by 2024, a citywide ratio of 1.8 jobs per household is maintained.

 UVG9 Use limited land resources more efficiently and pursue a development pattern that is more economically sound, by encouraging infill development on vacant and underutilized sites, particularly within urban villages.

 UVG10 Maximize the benefit of public investment in infrastructure and services, and deliver those services more equitably by focusing new infrastructure and services, as well as maintenance and improvements to existing infrastructure and services, in areas expecting to see additional growth, and by focusing growth in areas with sufficient infrastructure and services to support that growth.

 UVG11 Collaborate with the community in planning for the future.

 UVG12 Increase public safety by making villages places that people will be drawn to at all times of the day.

 UVG13 Promote physical environments of the highest quality, which emphasize the special identity of each of the city's neighborhoods, particularly within urban centers and villages.

 UVG14 Distribute urban villages around the city so that communities throughout the city have easy access to the range of goods and services that villages are intended to provide.

 UVG15 Encourage development of ground-related housing, which is attractive to many residents including families with children, including townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, ground-related apartments, small cottages, accessory units, and single-family homes.

 UVG16 Provide parks and open space that are accessible to urban villages to enhance the livability of urban villages, to help shape the overall development pattern, and to enrich the character of each village.

 POLICIES

 UV1 Promote the growth of urban villages as compact mixed-use neighborhoods in order to support walking and transit use, and to provide services and employment close to residences.

 UV2 Promote conditions that support healthy neighborhoods throughout the city, including those conducive to helping mixed-use urban village communities thrive, such as frequent transit service, vital business districts, a range of housing choices, a range of park and open space facilities, and investment and reinvestment in neighborhoods.

 UV3 Consider the following characteristics appropriate to all urban village categories except Manufacturing and Industrial Centers:

 1. Clearly defined geographic boundaries that reflect existing development patterns, functional characteristics of the area, and recognized neighborhood boundaries.

 2. Zoning sufficient to accommodate the residential and employment growth targets established for that village.

 3. The ability to accommodate a range of employment or commercial activity compatible with the overall function, character, and intensity of development specified for the village.

 4. Zoning that provides locations for commercial services convenient to residents and workers and, depending on the village designation, serving a citywide and regional clientele.

 5. Zoning sufficient to allow a diversity of housing to accommodate a broad range of households.

 6. Zoning regulations that restrict those public facilities that are incompatible with the type of environment intended in centers and villages.

 7. Most future households accommodated in multifamily housing.

 8. Additional opportunities for housing in existing single-family areas, to the extent provided through neighborhood planning, and within other constraints consistent with this Plan.

 9. Public facilities and human services that reflect the role of each village category as the focus of housing and employment and as the service center for surrounding areas.

 10. Parks, open spaces, street designs, and recreational facilities that enhance environmental quality, foster public health and attract residential and commercial development.

 11. A place, amenity, or activity that serves as a community focus.

 12. Neighborhood design guidelines for use in the City's design review process.

 UV4 Consider the following characteristics appropriate to Manufacturing and Industrial Centers:

 1. Clearly defined geographic boundaries that reflect existing development patterns, functional characteristics of the area, and recognized neighborhood boundaries.

 2. Zoning sufficient to accommodate the employment growth targets established for that center.

 3. The ability to accommodate a range of industrial activity compatible with the overall function, character, and intensity of development specified for the center.

 4. Zoning regulations that restrict those public facilities that are incompatible with the type of environment intended in manufacturing and industrial centers.

 5. Public facilities and human services that reflect the role of each center as a focus of employment.

 UV5 Consider suitable for urban village designation areas where:

 1. Natural conditions, the existing development pattern, and current zoning are conducive to supporting denser, mixed-use pedestrian environments where public amenities and services can be efficiently and effectively provided. In some instances, the urban village designation is intended to transform automobile-oriented environments into more cohesive, mixed-use pedestrian environments, or within economically distressed communities to focus economic reinvestment to benefit the existing population.

 2. Access to transportation facilities is good or can be improved.

 3. Public and private facilities, services and amenities, such as parks, schools, commercial services, and other community services, are available, or can be provided over time.

 and

 4. Existing public infrastructure has capacity or potential to accommodate growth.

 UV6 Establish clearly defined boundaries for centers and urban villages that reflect existing development patterns, functional characteristics of the area, and recognized neighborhood boundaries. Use boundaries to guide development activity, monitor growth and other development conditions, and evaluate performance towards meeting neighborhood and comprehensive plan goals for services and amenities.

 UV7 In order to support the existing character of areas outside of urban villages, and to encourage continued investment in all of Seattle's neighborhoods, permit areas outside of urban villages to accommodate some growth in a less dense development pattern consisting primarily of single-family neighborhoods and limited multifamily, commercial, and industrial areas.

 UV8 Involve the public in identifying needs for, planning, and designing public facilities, programs, and services. Encourage and provide opportunities for extensive public involvement in City decisions, and encourage other agencies to provide similar opportunities.

 UV9 Preserve developments of historic, architectural, or social significance that contribute to the identity of an area.

 UV10 Maintain and enhance retail commercial services throughout the city, especially in areas attractive to pedestrians and transit riders, to support concentrations of residential and employment activity, with special emphasis on serving urban villages.

 A-1 CATEGORIES OF URBAN VILLAGES

 Discussion:

 Seattle's urban village categories build on the urban center and manufacturing/industrial center designations called for in the Countywide Planning Policies. The designation of an area as an urban center, urban village, or manufacturing/industrial center guides other City actions to enhance the character and function of that area and to accommodate growth in a manner that supports the Countywide Centers growth concept. Urban village designations supplement the regional growth management concept by shaping it to fit Seattle's established, densely developed, and complex urban neighborhoods.

 A village designation recognizes the contributions a particular area makes to the city and provides guidance regarding the intended function, character, intensity, type and degree of growth anticipated for an area.

 UVG17 Guide public and private activities to achieve the function, character, amount of growth, intensity of activity, and scale of development of each urban village consistent with its urban village designation and adopted neighborhood plan.

 UV11 Based on the functions and densities they can support, designate categories of urban villages in order to guide planning for the mixed- use environments that are smaller or less dense than the urban center designations of the Countywide Planning Policies as follow:

 1. Urban center villages within urban centers

 2. Hub urban villages

 3. Residential urban villages

 UV12 The intended functions of the urban village categories are generally:

 * Urban centers, and the urban villages within them, are intended to be the densest areas with the widest range of land uses.

 * Hub urban villages will also accommodate a broad mix of uses, but at lower densities, especially for employment, than urban centers.

 * Residential urban villages are intended for predominantly residential development around a core of commercial services.

 * Manufacturing/industrial centers are intended to maintain viable industrial activity and promote industrial development.

 UV13 Designations of areas as hub urban villages and residential urban villages, as indicated in Urban Village Figure 1, shall be consistent with criteria developed to address the following factors:

 * Existing zoned capacity

 * Existing and planned density

 * 20-year growth targets

 * Population

 * Amount of neighborhood commercial land

 * Public transportation investments and access

 * Other characteristics of hub or residential urban villages as provided in this Plan, or further refined

 UV14 Establish goals for the mix of uses, target densities for employment and housing, the scale and intensity of development, and the types of public improvements desired to make each village category function as intended.

 URBAN CENTERS

 UVG18 Designate as urban centers unique areas of concentrated employment and housing, with direct access to high-capacity transit, and a wide range of supportive land uses such as retail, recreation, public facilities, parks, and open space.

 UVG19 Recognize areas that provide a regionally significant focus for housing and employment growth as urban centers. Enhance the unique character and collection of businesses and housing types of each center.

 UVG20 Designate urban center villages within larger urban centers to recognize different neighborhoods within a larger community.

 UVG21 Encourage housing development so that by 2024, the ratios of jobs per household shown on the following chart are achieved:

 Urban Center 2024 Jobs/Household Ratio

 Center City (First Hill/Capitol Hill, Downtown, 4.2 South Lake Union, and Uptown Urban Centers)

 University Community Urban Center (University 4.1 District Northwest, Ravenna, and University of Washington Campus*)

 Northgate Urban Center 2.5

 *The household numbers for the University District do not include on- campus dormitory housing.

 UV15 Designate as urban centers those areas of the city that are consistent with the following criteria and relevant Countywide Planning Policies:

 1. Area not exceeding one and one-half square miles (960 acres).

 2. Accessibility to the existing regional transportation network including access to other urban centers, with access to the regional high-capacity transit system to be provided in the future.

 3. Zoning that can accommodate a broad mix of activities, including commercial and residential activities, as appropriate to the planned balance of uses in the center.

 4. The area is already connected to surrounding neighborhoods by bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities or can be connected through planned extensions of existing facilities.

 5. The area presently includes, or is adjacent to, open space available for public use, or opportunities exist to provide pubic open space in the future.

 6. Zoning that permits the amount of new development needed to meet the following minimum density targets:

 a. A minimum of 15,000 jobs located within a half mile of a possible future high capacity transit station;

 b. An overall employment density of 50 jobs per acre; and

 c. An overall residential density of 15 households per acre.

 UV16 Designate the following locations as urban centers as shown in Urban Village Figures 2-7 below:

 1. Downtown Seattle

 2. First Hill/Capitol Hill

 3. Uptown Queen Anne

 4. University Community

 5. Northgate

 6. South Lake Union

 UV17 Designate urban center villages within the Downtown, First Hill/Capitol Hill and University Community urban centers as shown in Urban Village Figures 2, 3 and 5. While the Uptown Queen Anne, South Lake Union, and Northgate centers are presently considered to be too small to be subdivided into center villages, this does not preclude the designation of urban center villages within those urban centers in future neighborhood planning processes. Goals and policies for urban center villages apply to all urban centers.

 UV18 Promote the balance of uses in each urban center or urban center village indicated by one of the following functional designations, assigned as follows:

 Functional Designation Urban Center Village 1. Primarily residential. Belltown Capitol Hill

 2. Mixed, with a residential emphasis. Pike/Pine

 3. Mixed residential and employment. Denny Triangle Pioneer Square Chinatown/International District First Hill 12th Avenue University District Northwest Ravenna Northgate* Uptown Queen Anne* South Lake Union*

 4. Mixed, with an employment emphasis. Downtown Commercial Core

 * These urban centers are not divided into urban center villages.

[Urban Village Figure 7 - South Lake Union Urban Center](/~ordpics/115137At1UVFig7.gif)

 MANUFACTURING/INDUSTRIAL CENTERS

 UVG22 Ensure that adequate accessible industrial land remains available to promote a diversified employment base and sustain Seattle's contribution to regional high-wage job growth.

 UVG23 Promote the use of industrial land for industrial purposes.

 UVG24 Encourage economic activity and development in Seattle's industrial areas by supporting the retention and expansion of existing industrial businesses and by providing opportunities for the creation of new businesses consistent with the character of industrial areas.

 UV19 Designate as manufacturing/industrial centers areas that are generally consistent with the following criteria and relevant Countywide Planning Policies:

 1. Zoning that promotes manufacturing, industrial, and advanced technology uses and discourages uses that are not compatible with industrial areas.

 2. Buffers protecting adjacent, less intensive land uses from the impacts associated with the industrial activity in these areas (such buffers shall be provided generally by maintaining existing buffers, including existing industrial buffer zones).

 3. Sufficient zoned capacity to accommodate a minimum of 10,000 jobs.

 4. Large, assembled parcels suitable for industrial activity.

 5. Relatively flat terrain allowing efficient industrial processes.

 6. Reasonable access to the regional highway, rail, air and/or waterway system for the movement of goods.

 UV20 Designate the following locations as manufacturing/industrial centers as shown in Urban Village Figure 1:

 1. The Ballard Interbay Northend Manufacturing/Industrial Center, and

 2. The Duwamish Manufacturing/Industrial Center.

 UV21 Promote manufacturing and industrial employment growth, including manufacturing uses, advanced technology industries, and a wide range of industrial-related commercial functions, such as warehouse and distribution activities, in manufacturing/industrial centers.

 UV22 Strive to retain and expand existing manufacturing and industrial activity.

 UV23 Maintain land that is uniquely accessible to water, rail, and regional highways for continued industrial use.

 UV24 Limit in manufacturing/industrial areas those commercial or residential uses that are unrelated to the industrial function, that occur at intensities posing short- and long-term conflicts for industrial uses, or that threaten to convert significant amounts of industrial land to non-industrial uses.

 HUB URBAN VILLAGES

 UVG25 Accommodate concentrations of housing and employment at strategic locations in the transportation system conveniently accessible to the city's residential population, thereby reducing the length of work-trip commutes.

 UVG26 Provide convenient locations for commercial services that serve the populations of the village, surrounding neighborhoods, the city, and the region.

 UVG27 Accommodate concentrations of employment and housing at densities that support pedestrian and transit use and increase opportunities within the city for people to live close to where they work.

 UV25 Designate as hub urban villages areas that are generally consistent with the following criteria:

 1. Zoning that allows a mix of uses to accommodate concentrations of employment and housing. It may be appropriate to limit the mix of uses in some areas to provide for concentrations of either employment or housing.

 2. Sufficient zoned capacity to accommodate a minimum of 25 jobs/acre.

 3. The area presently supports, or can accommodate under current zoning, a concentration of residential development at 15 or more units/acre.

 4. Surroundings comprised primarily of residential areas that allow a mix of densities, and non-residential activities that support residential use.

 5. A minimum of one-third of the land area currently zoned to accommodate mixed-use and/or employment activity.

 6. A broad range of housing types and commercial and retail support services either existing or allowed under current zoning to serve a local, citywide, or regional market.

 7. A strategic location in relation to both the local and regional transportation network, including:

 a. A high level of transit service, with direct access to at least one urban center, with the possibility of improved connections to future high capacity transit stations

 b. Connections to regional transportation facilities

 c. Routes accommodating goods movement

 d. Connections to adjacent areas by pedestrian and/or bicycle facilities

 8. Open space amenities, including:

 a. Direct access to either existing or potential public open spaces in the immediate vicinity

 b. Accessibility to major open space resources in the general area via either existing or potential urban trails, boulevards, or other open space links, or anticipated major public investment in open space.

 9. Opportunities for redevelopment because of a substantial amount of vacant or under-used land.

 UV26 Designate as hub urban villages areas ranging from those able to accommodate growth with minor changes and public investment to those requiring more extensive public investment, where the potential exists to achieve desired village conditions through redevelopment over time.

 UV27 Designate the following locations as hub urban villages as shown on Urban Village Figure 1: 1. Lake City 2. North Rainier 3. Bitter Lake Village 4. Ballard 5. West Seattle Junction 6. Fremont

 UV28 Permit the size of hub urban villages to vary according to local conditions, but limit their size so that most areas within the village are within a walkable distance of employment and service concentrations in the village.

 RESIDENTIAL URBAN VILLAGES

 UVG28 Promote the development of residential urban villages, which function primarily as compact residential neighborhoods providing opportunities for a wide range of housing types and a mix of activities that support the residential population. Support densities in residential urban villages that support transit use.

 UV29 Designate as residential urban villages areas that are generally consistent with the following criteria:

 1. The area presently supports, or can accommodate under current zoning, a concentration and mix of residential development, of at least 8 units per gross acre on average, at a small to moderate scale.

 2. The area includes one or more centers of activity providing commercial and retail support services to the surrounding area.

 3. The area is generally surrounded by single-family and/or lower- density multifamily areas.

 4. The area is presently on the city's arterial network and is served by a transit route providing direct transit service to at least one urban center or hub village.

 5. A broad range of retail services to serve the residential population either already exists or can be accommodated in the area at a central location generally accessible on foot.

 6. The area has the opportunity to be connected by bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities to adjacent areas and nearby public amenities.

 7. The area presently includes, or is adjacent to, open space available for public use, or opportunities exist to provide pubic open space in the future.

 UV30 Balance objectives for accommodating growth, supporting transit use and walking, maintaining compatibility with existing development conditions, maintaining affordable housing, and responding to market preferences for certain types of housing, through the density and scale of development permitted.

 UV31 Allow employment activity in residential urban villages to the extent that it does not conflict with the overall residential function and character of the village, provided that a different mix of uses may be established through an adopted neighborhood plan.

 UV32 Designate the following residential urban villages as shown on Urban Village Figure 1: 1. Crown Hill 2. 23rd Avenue S @ S Jackson - Union 3. Madison-Miller 4. Wallingford 5. Eastlake 6. MLK@Holly Street 7. South Park 8. Upper Queen Anne 9. Roosevelt 10. Aurora-Licton 11. Green Lake 12. Rainier Beach 13. Morgan Junction 14. Admiral 15. North Beacon Hill 16. Greenwood/Phinney Ridge 17. Columbia City 18. Westwood/Highland Park

 UV33 Permit the size of residential urban villages to vary according to local conditions, but consider it generally desirable that any location within the village be within easy walking distance of at least one center of activity and services.

 UV34 Include among areas considered suitable for designation as residential urban villages those areas that possess the desired characteristics and infrastructure to support a moderately dense residential population and those areas that, while lacking infrastructure or other characteristics of a residential urban village, warrant public investment to address inadequacies in order to promote a transition to a higher density residential neighborhood.

 A-2 AREAS OUTSIDE OF CENTERS AND VILLAGES

 UVG29 Support and maintain the positive qualities of areas outside of urban centers and villages.

 UV35 Provide that the area of the city outside urban centers and villages remain primarily as residential and commercial areas with allowable densities similar to existing conditions, or as industrial areas, or major institutions.

 UV36 Protect single-family areas, both inside and outside of urban villages. Allow limited multifamily, commercial, and industrial uses outside of villages to support the surrounding area or to permit the existing character to remain.

 UV37 Recognize neighborhood anchors designated in adopted neighborhood plans as important community resources that provide a transit and service focus for those areas outside of urban villages.

 UV38 Permit limited amounts of development consistent with the desire to maintain the general intensity of development that presently characterizes the multifamily, commercial, and industrial areas outside of urban centers and villages and direct the greatest share of growth to the urban centers and villages.

 UV39 Accommodate growth consistent with adopted master plans for designated major institutions located throughout the city.

 B DISTRIBUTION OF GROWTH

 Discussion:

 The urban village strategy directs Seattle's future growth primarily to areas designated as centers and villages. The greatest share of job growth will be accommodated in urban centers - areas that already function as high density, concentrated employment centers with the greatest access to the regional transit network. Growth in industrial sector jobs will continue to be accommodated primarily within the two manufacturing/industrial centers where this activity is already securely established. Job growth will also occur in hub urban villages, which are distributed throughout the city to promote additional employment concentrations in areas easily accessible to the surrounding residential population, thereby locating jobs and services near where people live.

 The greatest share of residential growth will also be accommodated in urban centers, increasing opportunities for people to live close to work. The next most significant share of residential growth will be distributed among the various hub and residential urban villages throughout the city in amounts compatible with the existing development characteristics of individual areas.

 Modest growth will also be dispersed, generally at low density, in various areas outside centers and villages.

 Growth targets at the citywide level represent the city's share of King County's projected 20-year population and employment growth. The City plans its zoning and infrastructure to accommodate these targets citywide as well as for the individual urban centers and villages.

 Across the city, there are currently just under two jobs for every household. The 20-year growth targets this Plan anticipates will continue that ratio. Similar ratios apply throughout King County and the four-county region.

 Within the city, jobs and households are not evenly distributed. For instance, the four contiguous urban centers (Downtown, Capitol Hill/First Hill, South Lake Union, and Uptown) contain almost one- fifth of the city's households and nearly one-half of the city's jobs - on less than 5% of the city's land. And among the city's urban centers, there are substantial differences in the distribution of jobs and housing. Downtown, for instance, has about ten times more jobs than housing units. This Plan's growth targets indicate that the expected growth in households will change the ratio between jobs and households in some urban centers to be somewhat closer to the citywide average over the next 20 years. However, the growth targets also show that the role these centers currently play as primarily job centers is likely to continue.

 Twenty-year targets of the growth of each urban center and urban village can be found in Urban Village Appendix A.

 UVG30 Encourage growth in locations within the city that support more compact and less land-consuming, high quality urban living.

 UVG31 Concentrate a greater share of employment growth in locations convenient to the city's residential population to promote walking and transit use and reduce the length of work trips.

 UVG32 Plan for urban centers to receive the most substantial share of Seattle's growth consistent with their role in shaping the regional growth pattern.

 UVG33 Encourage growth in Seattle between 2004-2024, to be generally distributed across the city as shown in Figure 8.

 Urban Village Figure 8 Targets for the General Distribution of Growth 2004-2024

 Location % of Citywide % of Citywide Residential Growth Employment Growth

 In urban centers 58% 73% (27,450 households) (61,120 jobs)

 In manufacturing/industrial No housing target 14% centers (11,900 jobs)

 In hub and residential urban 25% No targets for villages (11,880 households) residential urban villages; Hub urban villages only: 5% (4,450 jobs)

 Remainder of city 16% No specific target (7,670 households)

 Total 47,000 households 84,000 jobs

 UVG34 Plan for a distribution of growth to each urban village that accomplishes the goals of the urban village strategy, and recognizes local circumstances, community preferences as expressed in neighborhood plans, and the need for an equitable distribution of growth across the city.

 UVG35 Achieve growth in urban centers, manufacturing/Industrial centers, hub urban villages and residential urban villages that is consistent with the 20-year residential and employment growth targets contained in Urban Village Appendix A.

 UVG36 Achieve development within urban villages at a pace appropriate to current conditions in the area.

 UVG37 Allow limited amounts of development in areas of the city outside urban centers and villages to maintain the general intensity of development that already characterizes these areas and to promote the targeted level of growth in village and center locations.

 UV40 Use 20-year growth targets for urban villages as a tool for planning for the growth that may occur in each urban village. Use these targets as a guide for City plans for development and infrastructure provision. Recognize that the growth targets do not represent the maximum amount of growth that could occur in a village. Recognize also that the private sector builds most housing units and creates most jobs, and, therefore, the growth targets impose no obligation on the City to ensure that those numbers of households or jobs actually occur.

 UV41 Base 20-year growth targets for each urban center, manufacturing/ industrial center and urban village contained in Urban Village Appendix A on:

 1. Citywide targets for housing and job growth over 20 years from the Countywide Planning Policies

 2. The center's or village's role in regional growth management planning

 3. Accessibility to transit

 4. Existing zoning, including capacity for commercial and residential development

 5. Existing densities

 6. Current development conditions, recent development trends and plans for development by public or private sector developers, such as major institution plans

 7. Density goals for each type of center or village

 8. Plans for infrastructure and public amenities and services necessary to support additional growth

 9. The relationship of the center or village to the regional transportation network

 UV42 Promote the concentration of development within centers and villages over the 20 year timeframe of this plan, by:

 1. Establishing 20-year growth targets that do not exceed 80 percent of zoned capacity for development, as calculated by the City

 2. Maintaining the 80 percent capacity margin in each center or village whenever zoning is modified

 3. Making reasonable efforts to provide services, facilities, and incentives to accommodate the targeted growth.

 UV43 Adjust growth targets at least every ten years to reflect state and county 20-year growth estimates and current information, or as neighborhood plans for the city's urban centers and villages are adopted or substantially revised.

 UV44 In order to monitor the effects of the urban village strategy: collect data, review, and report on growth and change in urban centers, urban villages, and manufacturing/industrial centers at least every 3 years. Include in these reports factors such as: progress on implementing neighborhood plan approval and adoption matrices; changes in the numbers of jobs and housing units; housing costs, including net loss or gain of low-income and very low-income housing units; housing types; crime rates; transportation systems and their use; business types; public facilities; services; and open space, to the extent information is practically available. Collect and report on similar data for typical areas outside villages for comparison. Broadly communicate the results of monitoring efforts.

 UV45 Review situations where the rate of growth is significantly faster or slower than anticipated in the growth targets contained in Appendix UV-A or where other measures indicate significant changes in the center or village over an extended period of time. Evaluate the significance of the changes with center or village residents, business owners, and other community stakeholders in light of the expectations underlying the neighborhood plan for the area, the actual level of growth, progress toward neighborhood plan implementation, and the relative maturity (level of mixed-use development, the pedestrian environment, infrastructure, and public facilities) of the area as an urban center or village.

 Establish by resolution, percentage threshold criteria to identify growth conditions over an extended period of time that are at variance with growth targets. Initiate a neighborhood review process when the established threshold criteria are exceeded, or when there are significant changes in the other growth monitoring measures. In the neighborhood review process, identify appropriate responses to significant growth or changes, including but not limited to:

 - community-led activities; - additional planning for, or re-prioritization of, City programs or infrastructure improvements; - partially or entirely updating a neighborhood plan; - amending growth targets; or - working with other public agencies to address community goals.

 C OPEN SPACE NETWORK

 UVG38 Provide safe and welcoming places for the people of Seattle to play, learn, contemplate, and build community. Provide healthy spaces for children and their families to play; for more passive activities such as strolling, sitting, viewing, picnicking, public gatherings, and enjoying the natural environment; and for active uses such as community gardening, competitive sports, and running.

 UVG39 Through the creation, preservation, and enhancement of the city's open spaces, support the development patterns called for by this plan, enhance environmental quality, provide light, air, and visual relief; offer community-building opportunities; provide buffers between residential areas and incompatible uses; provide spaces for sports and recreation; and protect environmentally sensitive areas.

 UVG40 Enhance the urban village strategy through the provision of:

 1. Amenities in more densely populated areas

 2. Recreational opportunities for daytime populations in urban centers

 3. Mitigation of the impacts of large scale development

 4. Increased opportunities to walk regularly to open spaces by providing them close by

 5. Connections linking urban centers and villages, through a system of parks, boulevards, community gardens, urban trails, and natural areas

 6. A network of connections to the regional open space system

 7. Protected environmentally critical areas

 8. Enhanced tree canopy and understory throughout the city

 UV46 Strive to accomplish goals in Urban Village Appendix B for the amount, types, and distribution of open space.

 UV47 Designate and preserve important natural or ecological features in public ownership as greenspaces for low-intensity open space uses.

 UV48 Identify City-owned open spaces on the Future Land Use Map.

 UV49 Consider open space provisions identified in adopted neighborhood plans, including specific open space sites and features, in guiding the expansion of the open space network.

 UV50 Establish, through the combined systems of urban trails, green streets and designated boulevards, a network among the city's varied open space features and urban villages and urban centers as well as connections with recreational and natural areas within the Puget Sound region.

 UV51 Provide unstructured open play space for children in or near residential neighborhoods.

 UV52 Guide development of shoreline public access and recreation as important elements in the city's open space network.

 UV53 Direct efforts to expand the open space network according to the following considerations:

 1. Locations for new facilities:

 a. Urban centers and villages targeted for largest share of residential growth; especially those existing high density residential areas presently not served according to the population-based or distribution goals for urban village open space;

 b. Other urban village locations where an adopted subarea plan or recognized neighborhood plan includes open space recommendations consistent with these policies; and

 c. Specific locations enumerated in the Parks functional plan outside urban centers or villages.

 2. Types of open space acquisitions and facility development:

 a. Village open space sites, urban center indoor recreation facilities, village commons sites, and community gardens;

 b. Critical open space linkages, connectors, and corridors that are highly accessible for active use within or directly serving urban villages, high density and/or high pedestrian, bicycle, or transit use areas;

 c. Open space linkages, connectors, and corridors that are highly accessible for active use serving other high pedestrian, bicycle, or transit use areas; and

 d. Other types of open space within or adjacent to urban villages that is accessible from adjacent urban villages.

 UV54 Promote sustainable management of public and private open spaces and landscaping including preserving or planting native and naturalized vegetation as appropriate to the landscape, removing invasive plants, protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat, and using an integrated pest management approach which favors natural over chemical pest management.

 Public Projects

 UV55 Seek to provide public open space in conjunction with major public projects such as utility and transportation projects, with the amount of open space based on the size of the project, open space needs of the adjacent areas, and the opportunities provided by the particular project.

 UV56 Emphasize flexibility in planning, designing, and developing new open space and encourage development of innovative projects.

 UV57 Promote inter-agency and intergovernmental cooperation to expand community gardening opportunities, and include P-Patch community gardening among priorities for use of City surplus property.

 D ANNEXATION

 UV58 Seek, through cooperative efforts with adjacent jurisdictions, an equitable and balanced resolution to jurisdictional boundaries of the remaining unincorporated areas adjacent to the city's limits. Future annexations to Seattle and/or city boundary changes shall be based on the following:

 1. The area has access or can easily be connected to areas already served by the City, allowing efficient delivery of services to the area;

 2. The City can readily provide services to the area; and

 3. The boundary changes or interjurisdictional agreements will result in a fair and equitable distribution of revenues, facilities development and maintenance and operating costs, and transfer of assets.

 UV59 Designate as Potential Annexation Areas areas that include parcels currently owned by the City or small areas almost completely surrounded by land currently within Seattle's city limits Areas meeting these conditions are designated as Potential Annexation Areas as shown in Urban Village Figure 9.

 UV60 Favorably consider annexation requests by the residents of unincorporated areas to meet regional growth management goals.

 UV61 Support annexations of unincorporated areas to surrounding jurisdictions by being involved in public participation efforts to determine local sentiment regarding annexations, participating in the development of interlocal agreements concerning final annexation plans with the goal of eventually eliminating any unincorporated island areas, and participating in the evaluation of any proposals to create new jurisdictions in these areas.

 LAND USE ELEMENT

 Introduction Discussion:

 The Land Use Element carries this Plan's urban village strategy forward to guide the development of Seattle's Land Use Code (Seattle Municipal Code Title 23). The Land Use Code regulates the development and continuing use of existing buildings and land. Seattle's land use regulations provide detailed rules that implement the general goals and policies contained in this element. The Land Use Element is not intended to guide City actions, such as the siting of public facilities or provision of City services, not related to the Seattle's Land Use Code.

 This element contains three sections. The first section lays out citywide land use policies for those issues where the City's policy is the same or similar across more than one type of land use category. The second section discusses each general land use category, identifying the policies that differentiate the City's land use categories from each other. The third section discusses location- specific land use policies, including policies that react to the special characteristics of an area, such as a historic district or a shoreline.

 A CITYWIDE LAND USE POLICIES

 Discussion:

 Citywide land use policies guide the development and interpretation of the City's land use regulations. Policies in this section generally apply across all of the City's zones, unless a difference is identified. Policies specific to a particular land use category, including differences from the citywide policies, are discussed in section B below.

 LG1 Provide for a development pattern consistent with the urban village strategy by designating areas within the city where various types of land use activities, building forms and intensities of development are appropriate.

 LG2 Foster neighborhoods in which current and future residents and business owners will want to live, shop, work, and locate their businesses. Provide for a range of housing types and commercial and industrial spaces in order to accommodate a broad range of families and individuals, income groups, and businesses.

 LG3 Encourage, through the City's land use regulations, development that protects the public's health and maintains environmental quality.

 A-1 The Future Land Use Map and the Location of Zones Discussion:

 Seattle is divided into a number of zones that regulate the uses and development in each area. These zones implement the urban village strategy, and the current zoning is generally appropriate.

 This plan organizes these zones into broad land use categories (single-family, multifamily, commercial/mixed-use, downtown, industrial, major institution), and describes how those categories of land use are intended to function. The Future Land Use Map shows how those categories are distributed throughout the city.

 The Future Land Use Map is a graphic representation of the future of Seattle. It displays where different types of development are planned to occur. The specific locations of zones are identified on the City's Official Land Use Map, which is part of the regulatory structure that implements this Plan. Most changes to the location of specific zones will not require amendments to the Future Land Use Map. Future Land Use Map amendments will generally only be considered for significant changes to the intended function of a large area.

 As time goes on, it can be appropriate to reconsider the zoning in a particular area or on a particular site. Decisions about the appropriate zoning for an area are guided by criteria that the City uses to judge whether a zone is appropriate in a particular location. Procedures and criteria for rezones are contained within the City's Land Use Code. Some policies in this Plan refer to adopted neighborhood plans. Those plans are found in the Neighborhood Planning Element of this Plan.

 LU1 Use the goals and policies included in this Plan to identify on the Future Land Use Map the general locations where broad categories of land uses are preferred. Use rezone criteria which implement the goals and policies of this Plan to identify on the City's Official Land Use Map where the specific zones are located.

 LU2 Generally, Future Land Use Map amendments will be required only when significant changes to the intended function of a large area are proposed. Changes in the Land Use Code zone designation of land that does not significantly change the intended function of a large area generally will not require an amendment to the Future Land Use Map.

 LU3 Establish rezone evaluation criteria and procedures to guide decisions about which zone will provide the best match for the characteristics of an area and will most clearly further City goals.

 LU4 Ensure that there will continue to be room for the growth targeted for an area when considering changes that could reduce the capacity for jobs or housing.

 LU5 Consider, through neighborhood planning processes, recommendations for the revision of zoning to better reflect community preferences for the development of an area, provided that consistency between the zoning and this Plan is maintained. Consider relevant goals and policies in adopted neighborhood plans when evaluating a rezone proposal.

 LU6 In order to focus future growth, consistent with the urban village strategy, limit higher intensity zoning designations to urban centers, urban villages, and manufacturing/industrial centers. Limit zoning with height limits that are significantly higher than those found in single-family areas to urban centers, urban villages, and manufacturing/industrial centers and to those areas outside of urban villages where higher height limits would be consistent with an adopted neighborhood plan, a major institution's adopted master plan, or with the existing built character of the area.

 LU7 Establish building height limits consistent with the goals of the urban village strategy and the type and scale of development intended for each zone classification.

 A-2 Uses Discussion:

 Seattle regulates the uses permitted in a land use category or zone so that adjacent uses and zones are appropriate neighbors. By defining the different uses that are permitted in an area, and the conditions under which they are permitted, Seattle's zoning creates different types of districts.

 LU8 Allow or prohibit uses in each zone based on the intended function of the zone and the impacts the uses can be expected to have on the zone and the surrounding area.

 LU9 Treat as conditional uses those activities having potentially severe impacts either because of the character of the surrounding area, or because the cumulative impacts of more than one such activity would be incompatible with the other permitted uses in the area.

 LU10 In order to ensure that a wide range of housing opportunities are available to Seattle's current and future residents, generally permit residential uses in all zones, except in industrial zones and some shoreline areas, where residential uses may conflict with the intended industrial or water-dependent use of the area.

 LU11 In order to maintain the character of Seattle's neighborhoods and retain existing affordable housing, discourage the demolition of residences and displacement of residents, while supporting redevelopment that enhances its community and furthers the goals of this Plan.

 LU12 Limit non-residential uses in residential zones to those that are necessary to the function of residential neighborhoods, are permitted under special circumstances, such as in historic structures, or are highly compatible with residential activity

 LU13 Seek the redevelopment of legally established structures and uses that do not conform to current regulations so that they are more conforming to current standards over the long term. Encourage nonconformities to become more conforming to current standards. Allow nonconformities to continue and support the maintenance and enhancement of nonconforming uses and developments so they may exist as an asset to their neighborhoods and so the City's land use regulations do not impose excessive burdens on legally established private property, as long as they do not expand their nonconformity.

 A-3 Public Facilities and Small Institutions

 LU14 In recognition of the positive contribution many institutions and public facilities have made to the areas in which they are located, respecting community needs and providing necessary services, allow small institutions and public facilities that are determined to be compatible with the function, character and scale of the area in which they are located.

 LU15 Development standards for small institutions and public facilities affecting building height, bulk, setbacks, open space, landscaping, and screening shall be similar to those required of other development, but should be allowed to vary somewhat because of the special structural requirements of some institutional and public facility uses. Establish criteria limiting variation, in order to achieve design compatibility with the scale and character of the surrounding area. Except for public schools and spires on religious institutions, do not permit small institutions or public facilities to vary from zoned height limits.

 LU16 Permit or prohibit public facilities similar to those provided by the private sector in all zones according to the use regulations and development standard for the particular type of use. Public facility uses not similar to those permitted for the private sector shall be permitted or prohibited depending on the intended function of the area. Evaluate parking and transportation impacts and consider the relationship with surrounding uses in the design, siting, landscaping and screening of such facilities. Allow changes by the Council to development standards that cannot be met for reasons of public necessity.

 LU17 Establish additional development standards for small institutions and public facilities in residential zones regarding light, glare, noise, odors, and parking and transportation.

 Parking for Institutions and Public Facilities

 LU18 Consider mitigating the negative impacts of traffic and parking by locating parking facilities to avoid traffic through residential streets, or establishing joint use of existing parking with adjacent uses.

 LU19 Allow modifications to standards for required off-street parking, based on the anticipated use of the facility, size of meeting or assembly areas, hours of use, anticipated effects of parking on the surrounding community, information contained in the transportation plan, access to public transportation and carpools, and other considerations of need and impact.

 LU20 Allow small institutions and public facilities to not satisfy all parking demands they generate, if they demonstrate how they will reduce traffic impacts. Do not permit the creation of a serious safety problem or blighting influence on the surrounding neighborhood.

 Concentration of Institutions and Public Facilities.

 LU21 In residential areas, avoid the concentration of institutions and public facilities if that concentration creates or further aggravates parking shortages, traffic congestion, and noise in or near residential areas.

 LU22 Allow the continued use of non-conforming institutional facilities by allowing for expansion or structural changes, as long as such expansion does not increase the structure's non-conformity and is within the development standards of the zone.

 Joint Use or Re-Use of Public Schools

 LU23 In order to encourage future school use of public school buildings that are no longer used as schools allow non-residential uses not otherwise permitted in the area to locate in school buildings as long as specific criteria for each such re-use are met.

 LU24 Determine criteria for judging the acceptability of proposed uses of school buildings for each school, which may differ from school to school. Address through the criteria the effects of the uses on students, teachers and residents of the surrounding area, and traffic, parking and other land use impacts. Determine the specific criteria for each school through a process that ensures the participation of the Seattle School District, the City, and the neighborhood involved.

 A-4 Telecommunications Facilities

 LU25 Recognize the public benefits provided by radio and television broadcast utilities (major communications utilities), and provide opportunities for the location of these uses in Seattle in order to allow for continued and improved service to the public. However, due to their size and appearance, these utilities are incompatible with the character of residential areas, and they create adverse impacts beyond the immediate site. Therefore, allow these utilities only in locations where impacts can be mitigated, and in a manner that does not lead to an overall increase in new or expanded TV and radio towers.

 Radiofrequency Radiation

 LU26 In order to protect public health and safety, the City should adopt standards to limit exposure to radiofrequency radiation. In the event that standards or guidelines more stringent than those in City codes are established by the federal government, the City should take steps to adopt those standards.

 LU27 Encourage the replacement of existing antennas with new antennas that result in lower levels of radiofrequency radiation at ground level.

 LU28 Review the following activities for compliance with radiofrequency radiation standards: the establishment of a new radio or television station transmitting from an existing utility, or any modification or replacement of existing radio or television antennas resulting in a significant increase in off-site radiofrequency radiation.

 Major Communication Utilities

 LU29 In order to protect the character and ensure the public safety of residential areas, do not permit new major communication utilities, such as radio and television transmission towers, in single-family, multifamily, or pedestrian-oriented commercial zones. Encourage the relocation of major communication utilities to nonresidential areas. Encourage co-location of major communication utilities in non- residential areas and the removal of existing single purpose major communications utilities in residential or pedestrian-oriented commercial areas. In these zones, expansion of existing towers or on- site replacement may be allowed only after review by the City Council.

 LU30 Require major communication utilities to be developed in such a manner as to minimize impacts on nearby areas. Setbacks, screening and landscaping shall be required in order to minimize visual impacts on adjacent properties, and to provide an appearance as compatible as possible with the uses permitted in the zone. Establish continuity with key elements of typical uses within the surrounding area; for example, in or adjacent to single-family areas, design elements such as peaked roofs, painted metal surfaces, and wooden fences, should be provided.

 Minor Communication Utilities

 LU31 Provide for the location of minor communication utilities and accessory communication devices that provide telephone and other communication functions, generally consistent with the following order of preference: 1. industrial, 2. downtown, 3. general commercial, 4. pedestrian-oriented commercial, and 5. residential.

 LU32 Impacts on nearby areas caused by minor communication utilities and accessory communication devices regulated by the City shall be limited. Allow minor communication utilities when they are developed in such a manner as to minimize impacts on nearby areas. Consider the following criteria: visual impacts, including antenna type, size and color, proximity to schools, neighborhood compatibility, land use and other impacts.

 A-5 General Development Standards Discussion:

 Development standards govern the density, bulk, height, open space, setbacks and lot coverage of development projects, and they shape Seattle's buildings and neighborhoods. Through the application of development standards, the intent of each zone classification is advanced. The City uses development standards to ensure that new development is consistent with the existing and planned character of a neighborhood and that physical and environmental constraints are accounted for.

 LU33 In order to enhance current investments in the city, provide flexibility to maintain and improve existing structures.

 Lot Coverage

 LU34 Limit the maximum amount of lot area covered by a structure to maintain compatibility with the scale and character of an area, to provide an adequate proportion of open area on a site relative to the area occupied by structures, and to provide occupants with sufficient access to light and air, as appropriate to the intended character and use of an area.

 Setbacks

 LU35 Use setbacks in residential areas to provide for adequate light, air, and open space, to help ensure privacy, and to maintain compatibility with the existing development pattern. Setbacks should also be used to separate residential uses from more intensive residential, commercial and industrial uses.

 Open Space and Required Yards

 LU36 Use requirements for the provision of on-site open space or required yards to help ensure that new development maintains existing patterns of landscaped front yards, to encourage permeable surfaces and vegetation, and to mitigate the cumulative effects of development. Require that usable open space or recreation areas be provided as part of construction of dense office buildings and all residential buildings.

 LU37 Explore setting limits on impervious surfaces or encouraging the use of other tools to increase storm water infiltration in appropriate areas.

 Screening and Landscaping

 LU38 Establish standards for screening and landscaping appropriate to each zone to minimize the impact of new development on the surrounding neighborhood, on the streetscape, on the natural environment and on areas with less intensive zoning.

 Trees

 LU39 Preserve and enhance the City's physical and aesthetic character and environment by:

 * Preventing untimely and indiscriminate removal or destruction of trees

 * Providing incentives to property owners for tree retention

 * Providing protection to large trees

 * Providing special protection to exceptional trees that, because of their unique historical, ecological, or aesthetic value, constitute an important community resource

 LU40 Use the following tools to protect trees, appropriate to the size, importance and location of a tree:

 * Providing flexibility in development standards

 * Promoting tree retention through the design review process

 * Promoting site planning and horticultural practices that are consistent with the reasonable use of property

 * Educating the public and development community concerning the value of retaining trees

 * Restricting the removal of trees on undeveloped land prior to review of a specific development proposal

 LU41 Because of the many benefits that street trees provide to both property owners and the general public, encourage the preservation or planting of street trees as development occurs, except in locations where it is not possible to meet City standards intended to preserve public safety and utility networks.

 Signs

 LU42 Regulate signs to facilitate adequate identification of businesses, reduce visual clutter, protect the public interest, provide opportunities for communicating information of community interest, and enhance the city's appearance and safety. Adapt provisions to correspond with the character and scale intended for each area.

 LU43 Allow flexibility in the height or overall area of signs on existing or new buildings that use a comprehensive design plan to create visual harmony between the sign, the building and the site where it is located.

 Noise

 LU44 Establish maximum permitted noise levels to reduce health hazards and nuisance factors associated with noise generated by some uses. Set maximum permitted noise levels that take into account both the function of the area from which the noise emanates and the function of areas where the noise may be heard.

 LU45 Require uses identified as major noise generators, due to the type of equipment used or the nature of the activity, to take additional measures to reduce noise so that they can meet permitted noise levels.

 Airborne Emissions and Odors

 LU46 Regulate uses and activities that have operations that generate air emissions such as dust, smoke, solvent fumes or odors, in order to maintain and encourage successful commercial and industrial activities while protecting employees, clients, nearby residents, the general public and the natural environment from the impacts that odors and airborne pollutants may cause.

 Light and Glare

 LU47 Establish controls on the direction and maximum height of lighting, and the glare from reflective materials used on the exterior of structures. The intent of this policy is to provide for the illumination of structures, parking areas, recreation areas and outdoor storage areas, while limiting light and glare on surrounding uses, enhancing the urban character of the city, and encouraging energy conservation.

 Views

 LU48 Seek to preserve views through:

 * Land use regulations that address view impacts with height, bulk, scale, view corridor and design review provisions;

 * Zoning policy that considers the effect of zone designations on views, with special emphasis on protection of views related to shoreline areas; and

 * Application of adopted environmental policy to protect public views, including views of mountains, major bodies of water, designated landmarks and the Downtown skyline, in review of development projects.

 A-6 Parking Discussion

 At its most basic, a parking space provides storage for a car. Parking is either provided by the City on-street, or off-street in private or public property. Off-street parking, which in Seattle is generally provided by the private sector, is regulated through the City's land use code. The quantity, design and location of parking closely relates to the general use of land and has a strong influence on the scale, shape and cost of development. As part of the public right-of-way, on-street parking competes with transportation modes for use of the street and is addressed in the Transportation element.

 LG4 Establish off-street parking requirements for new development to provide parking for the occupants of the structure. Set off-street parking requirements to reduce reliance on automobiles, promote economic development, and reduce housing costs.

 LG5 Regulate the location of off-street parking and the size and location of curbcuts to reduce parking and vehicle traffic impacts on pedestrians and residential and commercial streetscapes, and to prevent obstacles to commerce and traffic flow.

 LG6 Encourage the use of alternatives to single-occupant vehicles and the use of smaller, more energy efficient automobiles through the City's regulation of parking, including the amount of parking required, design of parking, location of parking, and access to parking.

 LG7 Recognize the different ways that parking is used by residents, businesses, customers, and employees when determining parking regulations. Generally support short-term parking for customers of businesses and longer-term parking for residents, while discouraging longer-term parking for employees who could use modes other than single-occupant vehicles to get to work.

 Parking Quantity

 LU49 Seek to further this Plan's goal of encouraging the use of public transit, carpools, walking, and bicycles as alternatives to the use of single-occupancy vehicles when setting parking requirements for both single-occupant vehicles and their alternatives. When setting new requirements for off-street parking, balance the goals of accommodating the parking demand generated by new development and avoiding on-street congestion of parked cars with the goals of lowering construction costs and discouraging single-occupant vehicles. Recognize differences in the likely auto use and ownership of the intended occupants of new development, such as low-income elderly or disabled residents, when setting parking requirements.

 LU50 In urban centers and urban villages, consider removing minimum parking requirements and setting parking maximums in recognition of the increased pedestrian, bicycle and transit accessibility these areas already provide or have planned.

 LU51 Establish requirements for bicycle parking in larger developments to encourage bicycle ownership and use in order to promote energy conservation, public health and reductions in traffic congestion.

 Parking Development Standards

 LU52 In order to maintain an attractive street level environment, to facilitate pedestrian and vehicular traffic circulation, to minimize adverse impacts of parking on adjacent areas and structures, to sustain on-street parking, and, where appropriate, to maintain or create a continuity of street fronts, generally prohibit street level parking between buildings and the street, restrict the number and size of curbcuts, and require alley access to parking when a surfaced alley is accessible to the rear of a building, and not prevented by topography.

 LU53 Permit shared and off-site parking facilities in order to encourage the efficient use of parking and to provide the flexibility to develop parking on a separate site. Ensure that such parking is compatible with the existing or desired character of the area and ensure that such parking is available for the duration of the use requiring the parking.

 LU54 Prohibit single-use parking in areas where it would be incompatible with the intended function of the area.

 A-7 Design Review

 LU55 Employ a design review process to promote development that:

 * Enhances the character of the city

 * Respects the surrounding neighborhood context, including historic resources

 * Enhances and protects the natural environment

 * Allows for diversity and creativity in building design and site planning

 * Furthers community design and development objectives

 * Allows desired intensities of development to be achieved

 A-8 Planned Development

 LU56 Permit, through Council or administrative conditional use approval, planned developments on large sites that allow variations from established standards to promote quality design compatible with the character of the area, enhance and preserve natural features and functions, encourage the construction of affordable housing, allow for development and design flexibility, and protect and prevent harm in environmentally critical areas. Do not consider such developments as sole evidence of changed circumstances to justify future rezones of the site or adjacent single-family zoned properties.

 B LAND USE CATEGORIES Discussion:

 The goals and policies in this section describe the different types of areas that the City seeks to create and enhance, in the context of existing environments and the urban village strategy. Each of the city's land use categories is intended to lead to a different collection of building types and uses. There are five broad categories of land use in Seattle: Single-Family, Multifamily, Commercial, Industrial and Downtown. Each of these land use categories plays a unique role in the city's residential and economic life, and provides for a different type of area.

 B-1 Single Family Areas

 LG8 Preserve and protect low-density, single-family neighborhoods that provide opportunities for home-ownership, that are attractive to households with children and other residents, that provide residents with privacy and open spaces immediately accessible to residents, and where the amount of impervious surface can be limited.

 LG9 Preserve the character of single-family residential areas and discourage the demolition of single-family residences and displacement of residents, in a way that encourages rehabilitation and provides housing opportunities throughout the city. The character of single- family areas includes use, development, and density characteristics.

 LG10 Provide for different intensities of single-family areas to reflect differences in the existing and desired character of single- family areas across the city. Allow development that is generally consistent with the levels of infrastructure development and environmental conditions in each area. Include opportunities for low- cost subsidized housing in single-family areas.

 LU57 Designate as single-family residential areas, those areas that are predominantly developed with single-family structures and are large enough to maintain a low-density development pattern.

 LU58 Use a range of single-family zones to:

 * Maintain the current density and character of existing single-family areas;

 * Protect areas of the lowest intensity of development that are currently in predominantly single-family residential use, or that have environmental or infrastructure constraints, such as environmentally critical areas; or

 * Respond to neighborhood plan policies calling for opportunities for redevelopment or infill development that maintains the single-family character of an area, but allows for a greater range of residential housing types, such as carriage houses, tandem houses, or cottages.

 LU59 Permit upzones of land designated single-family and meeting single-family rezone criteria, only when all of the following conditions are met:

 * The land is within an urban center or urban village boundary.

 * The rezone is provided for in an adopted neighborhood plan.

 * The rezone is to a low-scale single-family, multifamily or mixed-use zone, compatible with single-family areas.

 * The rezone procedures are followed.

 LU60 Apply small lot single-family zones to single-family property meeting single-family rezone criteria only when all of the following conditions are met:

 * The land is within an urban center or urban village boundary.

 * The rezone is provided for in an adopted neighborhood plan.

 * The rezone procedures are followed.

 Single-Family Residential Use

 LU61 Affirm and encourage residential use by one household as the principal use in single-family residential areas and the primary use permitted outright.

 LU62 Limit the number and types of non-residential uses permitted in single-family residential areas to protect those areas from the negative impacts of incompatible uses.

 LU63 In order to maintain single-family areas in residential use, prohibit parking lots or other uses accessory to permitted uses in abutting higher intensity zones from expanding into single-family residential areas.

 LU64 In order to create attractive and affordable rental opportunities and provide greater flexibility for homeowners, permit accessory dwelling units in single-family zones, subject to regulations designed to limit impacts and protect neighborhood character.

 LU65 Control the location, scale, access and development standards of institutions and facilities in single-family areas in order to reduce negative impacts such as noise, traffic and parking problems and protect Seattle's single-family housing stock through a conditional use or master planning process that considers:

 1. Concentration of institutions of facilities

 2. Bulk and siting

 3. Traffic and parking

 4. Demolition of residential structures

 5. Height and scale

 Minimum Lot Size (Density)

 LU66 Use minimum lot size requirements to maintain a low-density residential environment while reflecting differences in development conditions and the densities and scale of housing in various single- family residential areas.

 LU67 Permit exceptions to minimum lot size requirements to recognize building sites created in the public records under previous codes, to allow the consolidation of very small lots into larger lots, to adjust lot lines to permit more orderly development patterns, and to provide housing opportunity through the creation of additional buildable sites which are compatible with surrounding lots and do not result in the demolition of existing housing.

 Bulk and Siting

 LU68 Allow the development of detached single-family dwellings that are compatible with the existing pattern of development and the character of each single-family neighborhood.

 LU69 Reflect the character of existing low-density development through the regulation of scale, siting, structure orientation, and setbacks.

 Height

 LU70 Establish height limitations in single-family residential areas that establish predictable maximum heights, maintain a consistent height limit throughout the building envelope, maintain the scale relationship between a structure and its site, address varying topographic conditions, control view blockage and encourage pitched roofs.

 B-2 Multifamily Residential Areas

 LG11 Encourage the development and retention of a diversity of multifamily housing types to meet the diverse needs of Seattle's present and future populations.

 LG12 Promote a residential development pattern consistent with the urban village strategy, with increased availability of housing at densities that promote walking and transit use near employment concentrations, residential services and amenities.

 LU71 Designate as multifamily residential areas, existing areas predominantly occupied by multifamily development, as well as areas where greater residential development is desired to increase housing opportunities and promote development intensities consistent with the urban village strategy.

 LU72 Maintain a variety of multifamily zoning classifications to permit development at low, moderate and high densities with a variety of scales and configurations appropriate to the specific conditions and development objectives of different areas within the city.

 LU73 Balance the objective to increase opportunities for new housing development to ensure adequate housing for Seattle's residents with the equally important objective of ensuring that new development is compatible with neighborhood character.

 LU74 Establish rezone evaluation criteria that consider: maintaining compatible scale, preserving views, enhancing the streetscape and pedestrian environment, and achieving an efficient use of the land without major disruption of the natural environment.

 LU75 Limit the multifamily zones to areas that do not meet the single- family zone criteria, except in circumstances where an adopted neighborhood plan indicates that a different zone is more appropriate.

 LU76 Provide flexibility in rezone criteria for rezoning multifamily residential areas to compatible neighborhood commercial zones, if approved in an adopted neighborhood plan.

 Multifamily Residential Use

 LU77 Establish multifamily residential use as the predominant use in multifamily areas, to preserve the character of multifamily residential areas and preserve development opportunities for multifamily use.

 LU78 Limit the number and type of non-residential uses permitted in multifamily residential areas to protect these areas from negative impacts of incompatible uses.

 LU79 Provide zoning classifications that permit limited amounts of commercial use in what are otherwise residential zones in order to either provide retail and service uses in close proximity to residents in the densest multifamily environment or to create transitions between commercial and multifamily areas.

 Density Limits

 LU80 Limit density to provide greater predictability about the allowed intensity of development, by specifying a maximum number of units that may be permitted on sites in each lowrise multifamily zone. Accommodate a range of housing types to achieve development that meets the policy intent for each zone.

 Development Standards

 LU81 Limit building heights to establish predictable maximum heights, maintain a consistent height limit throughout the building envelope, maintain scale relationships with adjacent buildings, and limit view blockage. Encourage pitched roofs in lowrise and midrise multifamily areas.

 LU82 Determine the appropriate height for an area according to the policy intent for each multifamily classification.

 LU83 Limit bulk to ensure that buildings conform to the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area, to prevent the development of wide buildings that block views, and to encourage infill and single lot development.

 LU84 Allow greater lot coverage for townhouses in low-density and moderate-density multifamily zones to encourage development of ground- related housing.

 LU85 Require multifamily developments to provide open space for the use of the residents and to maintain existing street patterns of landscaped front yards, encourage permeable surfaces and vegetation, and mitigate the cumulative effects of development on open space and recreation resources in an area.

 LU86 Provide residents of lowrise multifamily buildings with usable ground level open space, while allowing some required open space to be provided as private decks and balconies or roof gardens.

 LU87 Use setback requirements to ensure access to light and air, and provide a sense of privacy, for residents of multifamily structures, and to maintain compatibility between new development and the existing pattern of setbacks and view corridors parallel to streets. Vary setback requirements so that the greater the size of a structure, the greater the required setback. Allow averaging of required side setbacks, within limits, to encourage modulation and visual interest of side facades. In addition to the general function of setbacks, use rear setbacks to provide adequate transition between zones of differing intensity.

 LU88 Allow limited projections of specific architectural features, such as open balconies, decks and bay windows, over the required setbacks to add visual interest to buildings, provided such projections are at a specified distance from property lines and do not adversely affect neighboring lots.

 LU89 Allow exceptions to parking development standards to encourage and facilitate development of ground-related housing, avoid creating additional construction costs, and to buffer areas of low intensity development.

 LOW DENSITY MULTIFAMILY AREAS

 LG13 Provide opportunities for infill development in areas already characterized by low-density multifamily development.

 LG14 Create transitions in development intensity between single- family zones and more intensive multifamily or commercial areas.

 LU90 Provide opportunities for attached housing at slightly higher densities than single-family areas.

 LU91 Maintain compatibility with single-family development through limits on the permitted height and bulk of new development.

 LU92 Use a range of low-density multifamily zones to:

 * Provide opportunities for limited multifamily and single-family infill housing while preserving the character of a neighborhood;

 * Allow for densities and building types that encourage both new construction and the conversion of existing single-family structures to duplexes and triplexes;

 * Provide for multifamily development, such as townhouses, of low height and small bulk where units have direct access to private yards, thereby increasing housing opportunities for families with children and others seeking ground-related housing; or

 * Encourage a variety of multifamily housing types with less emphasis on ground-related units, at a scale compatible with single-family structures.

 LU93 Use low-density multifamily areas to provide for transitional densities between single-family neighborhoods and more intense commercial and residential uses.

 LU94 In order to maintain a consistent and appealing character in low- density multifamily areas, seek to ensure, through development standards for low-density multifamily zones, that new and converted structures are compatible with existing development and reflective of the character of that development in terms of scale, open space, setbacks, siting and unit orientation.

 MODERATE DENSITY MULTIFAMILY AREAS

 LG15 Provide for the concentration of housing in areas where public transit and local services are conveniently available and accessible on foot.

 LU95 Use moderate-density multifamily zones in multifamily areas to provide additional housing opportunities, by:

 * Encouraging infill projects and conversions of existing buildings which are compatible with existing mixes of houses and small-to- moderate scale apartment buildings; or

 * Providing for new residential development at moderate densities which can fill in vacant or underdeveloped sites in neighborhoods with existing moderate density residential structures.

 LU96 Emphasize residential character in the development standards for moderate density multifamily zones and provide for a scale of development and building types that differs from those of single- family and low-density multifamily areas in order to accommodate increased residential densities.

 LU97 Promote denser but still human-scaled multifamily neighborhoods by permitting building types that allow for multifamily walk-up apartments, with height limits and development standards that promote a strong relationship between individual dwellings and the ground level.

 LU98 Accommodate housing at densities sufficient to promote pedestrian activity and frequent transit service, as well as support local businesses providing neighborhood services.

 LU99 Because low-income elderly and low-income disabled persons create lesser impacts than the general population, allow higher maximum density limits in moderate density multifamily zones for housing these populations to reduce costs and provide sufficient density to make the development of such housing feasible.

 HIGH DENSITY MULTIFAMILY AREAS

 LG16 Accommodate the greatest concentration of housing in desirable, pedestrian-oriented urban neighborhoods having convenient access to regional transit stations, where the mix of activity provides convenient access to a full range of residential services and amenities, and opportunities for people to live within walking distance of employment.

 LU100 Use a range of high-density multifamily zones in desirable pedestrian-oriented urban neighborhoods with access to regional transit, a broad range of services and amenities and access to employment to:

 * Encourage housing development of a medium to large scale with heights greater than those in lowrise zones;

 * Accommodate larger scale structures while maintaining the livability of these communities, including measures which minimize the appearance of bulk; or

 * Allow high-density residential development in urban centers and hub urban villages.

 LU101 Permit street level commercial uses serving the needs of the residential population in order to promote an active street environment and allow for greater access to services in high-density neighborhoods.

 LU102 In order to provide public open spaces easily accessible to the public, preserve or provide housing affordable to low and moderate- income households, preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings, or provide more space between towers to decrease view blockage and shadows on adjacent structures and open spaces, consider allowing additional height in the highest density multifamily areas.

 B-3 Mixed-Use Commercial Areas

 LG17 Create strong and successful commercial and mixed-use areas that encourage business creation, expansion and vitality by allowing for a mix of business activities, while maintaining compatibility with the neighborhood-serving character of business districts, and the character of surrounding areas.

 LG18 Support the development and maintenance of areas with a wide range of characters and functions that provide for the employment, service, retail and housing needs of Seattle's existing and future population.

 LG19 Include housing as part of the mix of activities accommodated in commercial areas in order to provide additional opportunities for residents to live in neighborhoods where they can walk to services and employment.

 LU103 Prioritize the preservation, improvement and expansion of existing commercial areas over the creation of new business districts.

 LU104 Consistent with the urban village strategy, prefer the development of compact concentrated commercial areas, or nodes, in which many businesses can be easily accessed by pedestrians, to the designation of diffuse, sprawling commercial areas along arterials, which often require driving from one business to another.

 LU105 Designate as mixed-use commercial areas, existing areas that provide locations for accommodating the employment, service, retail and housing needs of Seattle's existing and future population. Allow for a wide range in the character and function of individual areas consistent with the urban village strategy.

 LU106 Provide a range of commercial zone classifications, which provide different mixes and intensities of activity, varying scales of development, varying degrees of residential or commercial orientation, and varying degrees of pedestrian or auto orientation and relationship to surrounding areas depending on their role in the urban village strategy and community goals as voiced in adopted neighborhood plans.

 LU107 Distinguish between pedestrian-oriented commercial zones which are compatible with and easily accessible to their surrounding neighborhoods, and general commercial zones which are intended to accommodate commercial uses dependent on automobile or truck access.

 Uses

 LG20 Encourage diverse uses that contribute to the city's total employment base and provide the goods and services needed by the city's residents and businesses to locate and remain in the city's commercial areas.

 LU108 Provide for a wide range of uses in commercial areas. Allow, prohibit or allow under specified conditions uses according to the intended pedestrian, automobile or residential orientation of the area, the area's role in the urban village strategy and the impacts the uses can be expected to have on the commercial area and surrounding areas.

 LU109 Consider limits on the size of specific uses in commercial areas when those limits would:

 * Help ensure that the scale of uses is compatible with the character and function of the commercial area;

 * Encourage uses likely to draw significant traffic to an area to locate where traffic impacts can best be handled;

 * Promote compatible land use and transportation patterns; and

 * Foster healthy commercial development.

 Allow the limited expansion of existing businesses beyond established size limits in order to support the existing character and functions of the city's businesses and business districts.

 LU110 Discourage establishment or expansion of uses identified as heavy traffic generators. Review proposals for such uses in order to control traffic impacts associated with such uses and ensure that the use is compatible with the character of the commercial area and its surroundings.

 LU111 Regulate drive-in businesses and accessory drive-in facilities through development standards that vary according to the function of the commercial area in order to minimize traffic impacts and pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, avoid disruption of an area's business frontage, and improve the appearance of the commercial area.

 Outdoor Activities

 LU112 Prohibit or limit the location and size of outdoor uses and activities in specified commercial areas according to the function of the area and proximity to residentially zoned lots, in order to maintain and improve the continuity of the commercial street front, reduce the visual and noise impacts associated with such outdoor activities, and maintain compatibility with adjacent residential areas.

 Housing

 LU113 Allow residential use in commercial areas to encourage housing in close proximity to shopping, services, and employment opportunities. Encourage residential uses in and near pedestrian- oriented commercial areas to provide housing close to employment and services.

 LU114 Encourage residential development in mixed-use buildings to ensure healthy business districts that provide essential goods, services, and employment to the residents of Seattle.

 LU115 Conserve commercially zoned land for commercial uses by limiting street-level residential uses in areas intended to function as concentrated commercial areas or nodes. Consider allowing street- level residential uses outside of those areas in order to reinforce the commercial nodes and accommodate fluctuating market conditions. When street-level residential uses are permitted, seek to provide privacy for ground floor tenants and visual interest along the street- front. Provide open space as part of residential development in commercial areas to ensure open space amenities are available to residents.

 Density Limits

 LU116 Seek to focus development in transit and pedestrian-friendly urban villages while maintaining compatibility between new development and the surrounding area through standards regulating the size and density of development.

 LU117 Generally permit a greater intensity of development in pedestrian and transit supportive environments found in pedestrian- oriented commercial areas within urban villages than is permitted in general commercial areas or outside of urban villages.

 LU118 Ensure a compatible scale and intensity of development and control such impacts as shadows, bulk, and traffic associated with high-rise development through density limits for development in commercial zones.

 Development Standards

 LU119 Manage the bulk of structures in commercial areas to maintain compatibility with the scale and character of commercial areas and their surroundings, to limit the impact on views, and to provide light, air, and open space amenities for occupants.

 Heights

 LU120 Assign height limits to commercial areas independently of the commercial zone designations. Allow different areas within a zone to be assigned different height limits based on the appropriate height needed to:

 * Further the urban village strategy's goals of focusing growth in urban villages;

 * Accommodate the desired functions and intensity of development;

 * Provide a compatible scale relationship with existing development; and

 * Address potential view blockage.

 Establish predictable maximum heights that respond to varying topographical conditions.

 LU121 Allow limited exceptions to the height limit in order to accommodate ground-floor commercial uses or special rooftop features, to facilitate development of mixed-use structures, to enable structures to function appropriately, or to support innovative design which furthers the goals of this element or adopted neighborhood plans.

 LU122 In order to allow flexibility to enable full use of a site for permitted development, and to maintain and encourage a contiguous commercial streetfront, generally do not require setbacks in commercial areas, except when development occurs on a lot adjacent to a residential zone.

 Parking

 LU123 Set parking requirements to discourage underused parking facilities, which means tolerating occasional spillover parking, and allow minimum parking requirements to be eliminated, waived or reduced to promote the maintenance and development of commercial uses that encourage transit and pedestrian activity and provide a variety of services in commercial areas. Allow parking requirements to be reduced where parking demand is less because of the provision of an alternative transportation program. Such programs include the provision of carpool parking, vanpools, transit passes, or extra bicycle parking for employees. Consider setting maximum parking ratios for areas where excess parking could worsen traffic congestion and alternatives to automobile access are available.

 LU124 Allow parking management provisions to be reviewed or established in selected commercial areas, which may include locally sensitive measures such as cooperative parking, shared parking, restricted access, or special measures to meet the parking requirements established in these policies such as carpools, vanpools, or transit pass subsidies.

 LU125 Allow parking reductions when several businesses share customer parking to enable customers to park once and walk to numerous businesses, achieving greater parking efficiency.

 LU126 Regulate the location of off-street parking facilities on a lot according to the function and characteristics of the commercial area, as indicated by its designation as either a pedestrian-oriented commercial area or a general commercial area.

 LU127 Seek to limit impacts on pedestrian and traffic circulation and on surrounding areas when locating access to off-street parking. Generally encourage alley access to off-street parking, except when an alley is used for loading.

 PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED COMMERCIAL ZONES

 LU128 Use pedestrian-oriented zones to promote commercial areas with a development pattern, mix of uses, and intensity of activity generally oriented to pedestrian and transit use by maintaining areas that already possess these characteristics and encouraging the transition necessary in other areas to achieve these conditions:

 1. Strong, healthy business districts that are compatible with their neighborhoods, reinforce a sense of belonging while providing essential goods, services and livelihoods for the residents of the city;

 2. Mixes of activity in commercial areas compatible with development in adjacent areas;

 3. Appropriate transitions in the scale and intensity of development between areas;

 4. Residential development that is both livable for residents and compatible with the desired commercial function of the area; and

 5. An active, attractive, accessible pedestrian environment.

 LU129 Apply pedestrian-oriented commercial zones both inside and outside of urban villages where residential uses either exist or are in close proximity and where the intensity of development allowed under the particular zone designation conforms in size and scale to the community it serves.

 LU130 Generally allow pedestrian-oriented commercial zones in urban villages to accommodate densities of development and mixes of uses that support pedestrian activity and transit use.

 LU131 Provide use and development standards for pedestrian-oriented commercial zones, which promote environments conducive to walking and a mix of commercial and residential uses that further the goals for these zones.

 LU132 Locate parking facilities in pedestrian-oriented commercial zones where conflicts with pedestrian circulation and interruptions in the continuity of the street frontage will be minimized, such as to the side or rear of the building, below grade, or built into the building and screened from the street.

 LU133 Establish special pedestrian districts that may vary to reflect different characteristics and conditions of pedestrian-oriented commercial zones in order to preserve or encourage intensely retail and pedestrian-oriented shopping districts where non-auto modes of transportation to and within the district are strongly favored.

 GENERAL COMMERCIAL ZONES

 LG21 General commercial zones accommodate activities highly dependent on automobile and truck access and more intensive commercial and light manufacturing uses that are generally incompatible with pedestrian- oriented residential and mixed-use development.

 LU134 Use general commercial zones to support existing auto-oriented commercial areas serving a citywide or regional clientele located with ready access from principal arterials, or areas adjacent to industrial zones. Areas generally appropriate for general commercial zones should be characterized by a predominance of large lots, and limited pedestrian access, where adequate buffers or transitions can be provided between the area and residential areas or commercial areas of lesser intensity. In order to support more pedestrian-friendly environments within urban villages, encourage the conversion of general commercial areas within urban villages to pedestrian-oriented commercial zones.

 Uses

 LU135 Accommodate in general commercial zones the broadest range of commercial activities allowed in commercial areas.

 LU136 Recognize shopping centers, retail stores of all sizes, warehouses of moderate size, small office buildings of limited floor area, and, where appropriate, moderate scale residential and mixed-use structures as appropriate building types in general commercial zones.

 LU137 In general commercial areas, limit or prohibit, as appropriate, housing and/or substantial amounts of office development in areas where:

 1. The auto-oriented nature of the area or development is likely to encourage residents or office workers to commute using single- occupancy vehicles;

 2. These uses could potentially conflict with the preferred commercial function of the area or with the activities in adjacent areas; or

 3. The available land for certain commercial activities is limited and may be displaced if uses are allowed above certain intensities.

 Development Standards

 LU138 Allow residential and office densities that are similar to those permitted in comparable pedestrian-oriented commercial zones when projects in general commercial zones are built to the pedestrian- oriented commercial zones' standards.

 LU139 Generally assign height limits to general commercial zones that are compatible with the height of existing commercial development or are necessary to accommodate the requirements of the commercial activities intended for these zones and not to encourage high-density development of such uses as housing and offices more appropriately located in pedestrian-oriented zones in urban villages.

 B-4 Industrial Areas

 LG22 Provide opportunities for industrial activity to thrive in Seattle.

 LG23 Accommodate the expansion of existing businesses within Seattle, thereby stabilizing the city's existing industrial areas. Promote opportunities for new businesses that are supportive of the goals for industrial areas.

 LG24 Preserve industrial land for industrial uses and protect viable marine and rail-related industries from competing with non-industrial uses for scarce industrial land. Give special attention to preserving industrial land adjacent to rail or water-dependent transportation facilities.

 LG25 Promote high-value-added economic development by supporting growth in the industrial and manufacturing employment base.

 LG26 Give adequate attention to the needs of industrial activity while reducing major land use conflicts between industrial development and abutting residential or pedestrian-oriented commercial areas, and avoid placing unnecessary restrictions on manufacturing uses.

 LG27 Restrict or prohibit uses that may negatively affect the availability of land for industrial activity, or that conflict with the character and function of industrial areas.

 LG28 Prevent incompatible activities from locating in close proximity to each other.

 LG29 Accommodate a mix of diverse, yet compatible, employment activities in Seattle's industrial areas.

 LU140 Designate industrial areas where:

 1. The primary functions are industrial activity and industrial- related commercial functions.

 2. The basic infrastructure needed to support industrial uses already exists.

 3. Areas are large enough to allow the full range of industrial activities to function successfully.

 4. There is either sufficient separation or special conditions that reduce the potential for conflicts with development in adjacent, less- intensive areas.

 Uses

 LU141 Consider manufacturing uses, advanced technology industries and a wide range of industrial-related commercial functions, such as warehouse and distribution activities, appropriate for industrial areas.

 LU142 Consider high value-added, living wage industrial activities to be a high priority.

 LU143 Permit commercial uses in industrial areas to the extent that they reinforce the industrial character, and limit specified non- industrial uses, including office and retail development, in order to preserve these areas for industrial development.

 LU144 Subject to regulations for nonconforming uses, allow existing businesses to expand, in order to stabilize existing industrial areas, and encourage the siting of new businesses which are supportive of the goals for industrial areas.

 LU145 Prohibit new residential uses in industrial zones, except for special types of dwellings that are related to the industrial area and that would not restrict or disrupt industrial activity.

 LU146 Restrict to appropriate locations within industrial areas those industrial uses which, by the nature of materials involved or processes employed, have a potential of being dangerous or very noxious.

 LU147 Prohibit park and pool lots within 3,000 feet of a downtown zone in order to prevent the use of industrial land for commuter parking for downtown workers.

 Development Standards

 Density

 LU148 Limit the density of development through a floor area ratio (FAR) to ensure a level of activity compatible with industrial activity. The FAR is also intended to ensure that new development can be accommodated without major redevelopment of transportation and utility systems, and without creating other substantial negative impacts.

 LU149 Restrict the density or floor area of commercial uses not directly related to industrial activity to preserve industrial shorelines for industrial marine activity and to preserve access to major rail corridors. Vary the restrictions by industrial zone.

 Landscaping and Street Standards

 LU150 Recognize the special working character of industrial areas by keeping landscaping and street standards to a minimum to allow as much flexibility as possible for industrial development except along selected arterials and where there is a specific need to mitigate impacts of new development.

 LU151 On sites that are highly visible to the public because of their location on selected major arterials, require new development to provide street trees and landscape screening in order to promote a positive impression of the city's industrial areas. Streets appropriate for this special treatment are:

 1. Streets that provide major routes through the city and/or serve as principal entrances to downtown;

 2. Streets that provide the principal circulation route within an industrial area; and

 3. Streets where right-of-way conditions will permit required landscaping without conflicting with industrial activity.

 Shoreline View Corridor

 LU152 Allow certain additional view corridor standards to be applied outside of the shoreline district to preserve views of the water obtained through view corridors required in the shoreline district. Apply these standards to developments located on a waterfront lot (between the water and the nearest public road) adjacent to, but outside, the shoreline district. Do not apply these standards to areas along the Duwamish Waterway because they would not achieve the intended increase in visual access due to the generally flat terrain of the area and the substantially greater distances between arterials and the boundaries of the shoreline district.

 Parking and Loading

 LU153 Set parking and loading requirements for various uses to provide adequate parking and loading facilities to: support business activity, promote air quality, encourage efficient use of the land in industrial areas, accommodate loading needs, discourage under-used parking facilities, and maintain adequate traffic safety and circulation, while furthering the intent of industrial business attraction and expansion. Allow some on-street loading and occasional spillover parking. Provide for waivers and reductions from the established requirements to encourage the use of small sites and landmarks, and the reuse of existing structures.

 LU154 Maintain minimum and maximum standards for curbcuts and street driveways in order to balance the need to provide adequate maneuvering and loading areas with the goal of maintaining some on-street parking and safe pedestrian access.

 Noise

 LU155 Permit noise levels that would not be allowed in other parts of the city in industrial areas, except for buffer areas, in recognition of the special nature of industrial activities and the restrictions on residential uses that are in place in industrial areas.

 GENERAL INDUSTRIAL ZONES

 LU156 Use the General Industrial zones to promote the full range of industrial activities and related support uses. Distinguish among general industrial zones based on the density permitted for commercial uses not related to industrial activity. Include among the General Industrial zones:

 * Zones that protect marine and rail-related industrial areas from an inappropriate level of unrelated commercial uses and limit those unrelated uses through density or size limits lower than that allowed for industrial uses; and

 * Zones that allow a broader range of uses, where the industrial function of the area is less established, and where additional commercial activity could improve employment opportunities and the physical condition of the area.

 LU157 Include under the General Industrial designation those areas most suited to industrial activity, where the separation from residential and pedestrian-oriented commercial areas is sufficient to mitigate the impacts associated with industrial uses.

 LU158 Seek to protect industrial activity by differentiating among General Industrial zones according to permitted densities for commercial uses not directly related to industrial activity and by limiting the size of certain permitted uses.

 Uses

 LU159 Require conditional use review for certain uses to ensure compatibility with the primary industrial function of the zone. Require mitigation of any impacts on industrial activity, the immediate surroundings, and the environment in general. Because of the nature of industrial uses, classify certain non-industrial uses as conditional uses in order to protect public safety and welfare on non- industrial sites.

 LU160 Prohibit certain uses to preserve land for industrial activity or to minimize conflicts that may occur between the use and industrial activity because the use attracts large numbers of people to the area for non-industrial purposes, or because the use would be incompatible with typical industrial area impacts (noise, truck movement, etc.).

 INDUSTRIAL BUFFERS

 LU161 Provide an appropriate transition between industrial areas and adjacent residential or pedestrian-oriented commercial zones.

 LU162 Permit within Industrial Buffers the widest possible range of manufacturing uses and related industrial and commercial activities, while ensuring compatibility with the activity and physical character of abutting, less intensive zones. Include development standards or performance standards to protect the livability of adjacent areas. Apply these standards only where existing conditions do not adequately separate industrial activity from less intensive zones.

 LU163 Apply special height provisions on the edge of Industrial Buffers to ensure visual compatibility and a transition in scale between industrial areas and less intensive abutting zones. Do not apply the height limit where streets provide an adequate separation based upon street width, traffic, noise and topography. Apply a lower height limit for a greater depth of the zone where the zone is located across from a single-family or lowrise multifamily residential zone.

 LU164 Require conditional use review for certain uses to ensure compatibility with uses located in abutting, less intensive zones, to ensure consistency with adopted neighborhood plans, or to evaluate certain uses that could have significant impacts on other nearby uses.

 Screening, Landscaping, and Setback Requirements

 LU165 Apply standards for screening, landscaped areas, curbs and sidewalks, setbacks, and street trees to improve the appearance of, or obscure, outdoor activity, to maintain continuity along a street front, to enhance the environment and safety of the buffer area and to maintain compatibility with adjacent areas.

 LU166 Employ setback requirements for lots across the street from a residentially zoned lot to maintain a compatible scale of development along opposing industrial and residential streets. Do not apply increased setback requirements where an industrial lot is adequately separated from a residentially zoned lot by an unusually wide public right-of-way.

 LU167 Require special measures to address the visual impacts of outdoor and auto-related activities to ensure compatibility between these uses and less intensive zones.

 INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL ZONES

 LU168 Use the Industrial Commercial zones to promote a wide mix of employment activities, including industrial and commercial activities, such as light manufacturing and research and development.

 LU169 Limit development density in Industrial Commercial zones to reflect transportation and other infrastructure constraints, while taking into account other features of an area. Employ development standards designed to create an environment attractive to business, while recognizing the economic constraints facing new development.

 Uses

 LU170 Maintain use provisions in the Industrial Commercial zones to ensure that land is available for a wide range of employment activities and that areas will exist to accommodate the needs of developing new businesses.

 LU171 Require conditional use review for certain uses to ensure compatibility with uses located in abutting, less intensive zones; and to ensure safety and compatibility with other uses within the zone.

 LU172 Incorporate performance standards in the Industrial Commercial zones to create high quality environments that can attract new employers to the area and to protect abutting, less intensive areas from hazards, nuisances and objectionable impacts associated with permitted activities.

 Height

 LU173 Apply a range of maximum building height limits for all uses in Industrial Commercial zones to protect the special amenities that attract new technology industrial development, such as views of water, shoreline access, and the scale and character of neighboring development, so that these amenities will continue to be enjoyed, both within the zone and from the surrounding area. Assign height limits independently of the zoning designation to provide flexibility in zoning specific areas. Allow different areas within a zone to be assigned different height limits according to the rezone criteria.

 Development Standards

 LU174 Include development standards in the Industrial Commercial zones designed to create an attractive environment for new industry and ensure compatibility with surrounding development without inhibiting more traditional industrial activity or the expansion of smaller firms already located in the area. Generally require screening, landscaping and setback standards in the Industrial Commercial zone similar to those found in the pedestrian-oriented commercial areas to promote an attractive setting for new industries.

 B-5 Downtown Areas Discussion:

 Goals and policies guiding development in the Downtown area can be found as part of the Downtown Urban Center Neighborhood Plan, located in the Neighborhood Planning Element.

 LG30 Promote Downtown Seattle as the home to the broadest mix of activities and greatest intensity of development in the region. Promote the continued economic vitality of Downtown Seattle, with particular attention to the retail core and the tourism industry.

 LU175 Designate as Downtown, those areas that are intended to accommodate the densest mixed-use, residential, office and retail development.

 LU176 Recognize the division of downtown into areas with one of the following primary land use functions:

 * Office, * Retail, * Mixed-use commercial, * Mixed-use residential, and * Harborfront.

 LU177 Use a range of downtown land use zones to support the existing character and desired environment of different areas downtown.

 C LOCATION-SPECIFIC LAND USE POLICIES Discussion:

 The basic zoning categories described in Section B, are augmented here by policies that respond to specific characteristics of an area. For example, historic districts are governed by a basic zoning category as well as regulations that respond to the unique historic characteristics of an area. This section provides the policy foundation to guide how the City adjusts its regulations to respond to unique environments, particularly those created by: major institutions, historic districts and landmarks, environmentally critical areas and shorelines.

 LG31 Provide flexibility in, or supplement, standard zone provisions to achieve special public purposes where circumstances warrant. Such areas include shoreline areas, airport height districts, historic landmark and special review districts, major institutions, subarea plan districts, areas around high capacity transit stations, and other appropriate locations.

 LU178 Promote the integration of high capacity transit stations into the neighborhoods surrounding them and foster development appropriate to significant increases in pedestrian activity and transit ridership. Use overlay districts or other adjustments to zoning to cultivate transit-oriented communities.

 LU179 Permit the establishment of zoning overlay districts, which may modify the regulations of the underlying land use zone categories to address special circumstances and issues of significant public interest in a subarea of the city, subject to the limitations on establishing greater density in single-family areas. Overlays may be established through neighborhood planning.

 C-1 Major Institutions Discussion:

 Hospitals and higher educational facilities play an important role in Seattle. Institutions containing these facilities provide needed health and educational services to the citizens of Seattle and the region. They also contribute to employment opportunities and to the overall diversification of the city's economy. However, when located in or adjacent to residential and pedestrian-oriented commercial areas, the activities and facilities of major institutions can have negative impacts such as traffic generation, loss of housing, displacement and incompatible physical development. These policies provide a foundation for the City's approach to balancing the growth of these institutions with the need to maintain the livability of the surrounding neighborhoods.

 LG32 Maximize the public benefits of major institutions, including health care and educational services, while minimizing the adverse impacts associated with development and geographic expansion.

 LG33 Recognize the significant economic benefits of major institutions in the city and the region and their contributions to employment growth.

 LG34 Balance each major institution's ability to change and the public benefit derived from change with the need to protect the livability and vitality of adjacent neighborhoods.

 LG35 Promote the integration of institutional development with the function and character of surrounding communities in the overall planning for urban centers.

 LU180 Designate the campuses of large hospitals, colleges and universities as Major Institutions to recognize that a separate public process is used to define appropriate uses in these areas.

 LU181 Provide for the coordinated growth of major institutions through major institution conceptual master plans and the establishment of major institution overlay zones.

 LU182 Establish Major Institution Overlays (MIO) to permit appropriate institutional development within boundaries while minimizing the adverse impacts associated with development and geographic expansion. Balance the public benefits of growth and change for major institutions with the need to maintain the livability and vitality of adjacent neighborhoods. Where appropriate, establish MIO boundaries so that they contribute to the compatibility between major institution areas and less intensive zones.

 LU183 Allow modifications to the underlying zone provisions in order to allow major institutions to thrive while ensuring that impacts of development on the surrounding neighborhood are satisfactorily mitigated.

 LU184 Allow all functionally integrated major institution uses within each overlay district, provided the development standards of the underlying zone are met. Permit development standards specifically tailored for the major institution and its surrounding area within the overlay district through a master plan process.

 LU185 Allow modification of use restrictions and parking requirements of the underlying zoning by the overlay to accommodate the changing needs of major institutions, provide flexibility for development and encourage a high-quality environment. Allow modification of the development standards and other requirements of the underlying zoning by an adopted master plan.

 LU186 Discourage the expansion of established major institution boundaries.

 LU187 Encourage significant community involvement in the development, monitoring, implementation and amendment of major institution master plans, including the establishment of citizen's advisory committees containing community and major institution representatives.

 LU188 Encourage Advisory Committee participation throughout the process of revision, amendment and refinement of the master plan proposal.

 LU189 Require preparation of either a master plan or a revision to the appropriate existing master plan when a major development is proposed that is part of a major institution, and does not conform with the of the underlying zoning and is not included in an existing master plan.

 LU190 Provide procedures for considering the establishment of new major institutions.

 LU191 Locate new institutions in areas where such activities are compatible with the surrounding land uses and where the impacts associated with existing and future development can be appropriately mitigated.

 Uses

 LU192 Define all uses that are functionally integrated with, or substantively related to, the central mission of the major institution or that primarily and directly serve the users of the institution as major institution uses and permit these uses in the Major Institution Overlay district, subject to the provisions of this policy, and in accordance with the development standards of the underlying zoning classifications or adopted master plan.

 Development Standards

 LU193 Apply the development standards of the underlying zoning classification for height, density, bulk, setbacks, coverage and landscaping for institutions to all major institution development, except for specific standards altered by a master plan.

 LU194 The need for appropriate transition shall be a primary consideration in determining setbacks.

 Parking Standards

 LU195 Establish minimum parking requirements in MIO districts to meet the needs of the major institution and minimize parking demand in the adjacent areas. Include maximum parking limits to avoid unnecessary traffic in the surrounding areas and to limit the use of single occupancy vehicles (SOV).

 LU196 Allow short-term or long-term parking space provisions to be modified as part of a Transportation Management Program (TMP).

 LU197 Allow an increase to the number of permitted spaces only when an increase is necessary to reduce parking demand on streets in surrounding areas and is compatible with goals to minimize traffic congestion in the area.

 LU198 Use the TMP to reduce the number of vehicle trips to the major institution, minimize the adverse impacts of traffic on the streets surrounding the institution, minimize demand for parking on nearby streets, especially residential streets, and minimize the adverse impacts of institution-related parking on nearby streets. To meet these objectives seek to reduce the number of SOVs used by employees and students to reach the campus at peak times.

 Residential Structures

 LU199 Encourage the preservation of housing within major institution overlay districts and the surrounding areas. Discourage conversion or demolition of housing within a major institution campus, and allow such action only when necessary for expansion of the institution. Prohibit demolition of structures with non-institutional residential uses for the development of any parking lot or parking structure which could provide non-required parking or be used to reduce a deficit of required parking spaces. Prohibit development by a major institution outside of the MIO district boundaries when it would result in the demolition of structures with residential uses or change of these structures to non-residential uses.

 Master Plan

 LU200 Require a master plan for each Major Institution proposing development which could affect the livability of adjacent neighborhoods or has the potential for significant adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Use the master plan to facilitate a comprehensive review of benefits and impacts of the Major Institution development.

 LU201 Use the master plan to

 1. Give clear guidelines and development standards on which the major institutions can rely for long-term planning and development;

 2. Provide the neighborhood advance notice of the development plans of the major institution;

 3. Allow the City to anticipate and plan for public capital or programmatic actions that will be needed to accommodate development; and

 4. Provide the basis for determining appropriate mitigating actions to avoid or reduce adverse impacts from major institution growth.

 LU202 The master plan should establish or modify boundaries; provide physical development standards for the overlay district; define the development program for the specified time-period; and describe a transportation management program.

 LU203 Require City Council review and adoption of the master plan following a cooperative planning process to develop the master plan by the Major Institution, the surrounding community and the City.

 LU204 In considering rezones, the objective shall be to achieve a better relationship between residential, commercial or industrial uses and the Major Institution uses, and to reduce or eliminate major land use conflicts in the area.

 C-2 Historic Districts and Landmarks

 LU205 Encourage the preservation, restoration and reuse of designated historic districts and landmarks.

 LU206 Allow for the designation of areas as landmark and special review districts, and of structures, sites, and objects as City of Seattle landmarks, to protect, enhance, and perpetuate the individual historical or architectural identity of the area, structure, site, or object. Recognize that landmark designations help protect significant historic resources and qualities that distinguish these resources, and encourage stability, rehabilitation, restoration and planned development.

 LU207 Allow development standards and design review processes to be adopted specifically for a designated landmark or special review district, including guidelines that may specify design-related features allowed, encouraged, limited, or excluded from the district. Allow adopted guidelines to modify, exempt, or supersede the standards of the underlying zone, although for elements not included in the district guidelines, the standards of the existing designation shall continue to apply.

 C-3 Environmentally Critical Areas

 LG36 Protect the ecological functions and values of wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas; prevent erosion from development on steep slopes; and protect the public health, safety and welfare in landslide-prone, liquefaction-prone and flood-prone areas.

 LG37 Permit landowners to develop land in a manner that is reasonable in light of the environmental constraints present.

 LG38 Avoid development that causes injury to persons, property, public resources or the environment.

 LU208 Strictly regulate development in critical areas to protect the public health, safety, and welfare on development sites and neighboring properties.

 LU209 Limit impacts to environmentally critical areas and buffers by directing activities away from these areas through restrictions on the design and siting of structures and on grading and other land disturbing activity.

 LU210 Permit modification of development standards in environmentally critical areas to help protect those areas and to allow reasonable development.

 LU211 When reviewing a rezone proposed for an area located in or adjacent to a critical area, consider the effect of the rezone on the critical area, and recognize that lower intensity zones are generally more appropriate in critical areas than higher intensity zones.

 Landslide-prone Areas

 LU212 Seek to protect landslide-prone hillsides, including steep slopes, against future damage due to instability created or exacerbated by development, including protecting against damage to public facilities. Take into account the relative risk to life or property when reviewing development proposals for landslide-prone areas.

 LU213 Identify landslide-prone areas through identification of geologic, hydrologic and topographic factors that contribute to landslides.

 LU214 Before permitting development on a landslide-prone hillside, ensure that engineering solutions are designed to prevent slides both during high-stress periods and in the event of poor maintenance of the hillside.

 Require, as appropriate, that special engineering considerations be integrated into a structure's design to provide an acceptable level of risk. Design permanent facilities for a 100-year life expectancy. Account for a one-in-100 year event for seismic activity when designing a development.

 Steep Slopes

 LU215 Regulate development on steep slopes to control erosion, water runoff, siltation of streams, lakes, Puget Sound and the City's stormwater facilities.

 LU216 Limit disturbance of the slope and maintain and enhance existing vegetative cover in order to control erosion, water runoff, and siltation of streams, lakes, Puget Sound, and the City's stormwater facilities.

 Liquefaction-prone Areas

 LU217 Identify areas subject to liquefaction during earthquakes. Require that new development in those areas is designed and built to limit property damage and eliminate injury and loss of life during earthquakes.

 Abandoned Solid Waste Landfills

 LU218 Regulate development on sites of abandoned solid waste landfills to minimize the risks of ground subsidence, earthquake induced ground shaking, and methane gas build up.

 LU219 Regulate development on sites within 1,000 feet of abandoned solid waste landfills to minimize the risk of methane gas build-up.

 Wetlands

 LU220 Seek a net gain in wetland function by enhancing and restoring wetland function across the city.

 LU221 Strictly regulate development to minimize construction and post- construction impacts in and near wetlands in order to protect the remaining unique and valuable wetland resources left in Seattle.

 LU222 Support efforts to restore wetlands to their original state and natural function.

 LU223 Seek no net loss of wetland acreage, and require no net loss of wetland values or functions across the city, including, but not limited to flood control, water quantity and quality, fish and wildlife habitat, and quality of life and educational benefits. In limited circumstances, allow a wetland's functions to be replaced either on or off-site.

 LU224 Near wetlands, protect vegetation in its existing condition unless augmenting or replanting can be shown to better protect the wetland's functions.

 Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas

 LU225 Regulate development in and near designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas in order to protect the remaining native wildlife species and significant fish populations, especially salmonids.

 LU226 Whenever possible, maintain in their natural or native state those areas that contain the natural vegetative cover and physical space necessary to serve as valuable habitat, in order to:

 * Protect large contiguous wildlife habitat areas;

 * Maintain wildlife corridors that connect functions;

 * Conserve soil and ground conditions that support native vegetation;

 * Prevent siltation and high water temperatures in downstream habitat;

 * Dampen fluctuations in surface water flow which are typically problematic in urbanized areas; and

 * Maintain groundwater recharge flow to support stream flows during drier seasons.

 LU227 Regulate development within riparian corridors to protect the natural functions and values of streams, creeks and lakes from the potential negative effects of urban development.

 LU228 Establish development standards to:

 * Prevent the degradation of water quality,

 * Prevent erosion and siltation, and

 * Protect fish and wildlife habitat.

 LU229 Establish buffer areas adjacent to the water body on each development site that is located within a riparian corridor. Strictly limit development within buffer areas, and leave vegetation in its natural condition unless new plantings will enhance the functions of the buffer.

 Flood-prone Areas

 LU230 Regulate development in flood-prone areas in order to protect the public health and safety, and to prevent damage to private property caused by hazardous flooding conditions.

 C-4 Shorelines Discussion:

 In conformance with the goals of the State Shoreline Management Act, the Seattle Shoreline Master Program accommodates a variety of functions and activities unique to shoreline areas, especially water- dependent businesses and shoreline recreation activities, and protects and enhances public access, natural areas, and views of the water. Management of Seattle's shorelines is guided by the Area Objectives for Seattle's shorelines as established in these policies, and the purpose of the shoreline environments, the shoreline environment designations and the use regulations and development standards established in the Land Use Code. All these elements combined constitute the Seattle Shoreline Master Program.

 SHORELINE USE

 LG39 Establish shoreline uses that result in long-term over short- term benefit.

 LG40 Plan for and encourage the integration and location of compatible uses within segments of the shoreline.

 LG41 Locate all non-water dependent uses upland to optimize shoreline use and access.

 LG42 Provide a management system that will plan for and permit all reasonable and appropriate use through a system of priorities.

 LG43 Protect those areas of shoreline that are geologically dangerous or fragile, or biologically fragile.

 LU231 Permit only those uses or conditions that retain use options for future generations unless identified benefits clearly outweigh the physical, social and/or economic loss to future generations since competition between uses for shoreline does not generally occur at one moment, but over a period of time. Water dependent uses generally shall have priority. Preference will be given in the following order:

 1st. Protection and enhancement of natural areas or systems: those identified as containing or having unique geological, ecological or biological significance.

 2nd. Water-dependent uses: all uses that cannot exist in any other location and are dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of their operations. However, because of their historic role and legal recognition by the City, floating home moorage are designated as a water dependent use. Such designation does not imply support for increase of floating home moorage. The intent of this policy is to recognize the existing floating home community in Lake Union and Portage Bay, while protecting natural areas, preserving public access to the shoreline, and preventing the displacement of water-dependent commercial and manufacturing uses by floating homes. Areas with substantial concentrations of existing floating homes shall be given a designation that preserves residential uses.

 3rd. Non-water dependent uses: those uses that do not need a waterfront location to operate.

 LU232 Define in the Land Use Code all appropriate shoreline uses, and provide site development performance standards and other appropriate criteria indicating minimal acceptable standards to be achieved. Uses shall be preferred in the following order:

 1. On waterfront lots:

 a. Protection and Enhancement. Uses that provide for protection and enhancement of natural areas or systems.

 b. Water-dependent uses. Uses that are dependent on the water by the intrinsic nature of their operation.

 c. Water-related uses. Uses that are not intrinsically dependent on a waterfront location but whose operation cannot occur economically without use of the water adjacent to the site.

 d. Non-water-dependent uses with regulated public access. Uses that are neither water-dependent nor water-related because they do not use the water, although a waterfront location may increase their profitability. Such uses provide a public benefit because they provide an opportunity for substantial numbers of the people to enjoy the shorelines of the City.

 e. Non water-dependent uses without regulated public access.

 2. On upland lots: Preferred uses are those that complement uses on adjacent waterfront lots.

 3. The preference for natural areas shall be accomplished by prohibiting uses that would disrupt natural areas or by providing enhancement of such areas where necessary.

 4. Preferred uses will vary according to the purpose of the environment:

 a. If the purpose of the environment is to encourage water-dependent and water-related uses, these uses shall be preferred by prohibiting and/or restricting non water-dependent uses on waterfront lots.

 b. If the purpose of the environment is to provide public access, providing public access shall be preferred by permitting non water-dependent uses and requiring public access.

 5. The determination that a shoreline area is suitable for a particular water-dependent use shall be made by comparing the area's physical characteristics and existing land use patterns to the rezone requirements of water-dependent uses.

 LU233 Identify those areas of shorelines that are geologically or biologically dangerous or fragile and regulate development to prevent damage to property or organisms and the general public.

 LU234 Encourage the development of support industries and services on upland lots by permitting a wider range of uses and more flexible development standards than waterfront lots, and avoiding potential incompatibility with water-dependent uses on waterfront lots.

 Shoreline Access

 LG44 Provide for the optimum amount of public access-both physical and visual-to the shorelines of Seattle.

 LG45 Preserve and enhance views of the shoreline and water from upland areas where appropriate.

 LU235 Increase opportunities for substantial numbers of people to enjoy the shorelines, by permitting non-water-dependent uses providing public access to locate in waterfront areas less suited for water- dependent uses, and by requiring public access on public property.

 LU236 Promote public enjoyment of the shorelines through public access standards by requiring improvements that are safe, well designed, and offer adequate access to the water.

 LU237 Except for single-family residences, maintain standards and criteria for public access and private use of publicly owned or controlled shorelines to achieve the following:

 1. Provide linkages between shoreline public facilities via trails, paths, etc., to connect with terminal boating and other recreational facilities.

 2. Indicate by use of signs and graphics all publicly owned or controlled shoreline.

 3. If appropriate, offer bonuses for the provision of public access in private property.

 4. Require public agencies such as the City, Port of Seattle, and King County Metro, etc., to provide public access opportunities at new shorelines facilities and encourage these agencies to provide similar opportunities in existing facilities.

 5. Provide standards and criteria for view and visual access from upland and shoreline areas.

 6. Give priority to the operating requirements of the water-dependent and water-related uses over preservation of views in those environments where water-dependent uses are encouraged.

 7. Limit off-premise signs and regulate other signs to enhance and protect views.

 LU238 Waterways in Lake Union and Portage Bay are for public navigation access and commerce and, in general, the City shall not request that the designation be removed from waterways. The City may request that waterways be vacated only when the city reclaims the area as street right of way or for public park purposes. The City may request that the dry land portion of a waterway be redesignated for the additional purpose of providing permanent public access improvements.

 Transportation

 LG46 Develop a transportation network that supports and enhances use of and access to the shorelines

 LG47 Relocate transportation facilities that are functionally or aesthetically disruptive to the shoreline.

 LU239 Encourage the transport of materials and cargo via modes having the least environmental impact.

 LU240 Encourage the maintenance and future development of inter-modal commuter ferry services, complementary to other public transportation systems, from both intracity locations and regional activity centers.

 LU241 Streets, highways, freeways and railroads should be located away from the shoreline in order to maximize the area of waterfront lots and minimize the area of upland lots. Streets, highways, freeways and railroads not needed for access to shoreline lots shall be discouraged in the Shoreline District.

 LU242 The primary purpose of waterways in Lake Union and Portage Bay is to facilitate navigation and commerce by providing navigational access to adjacent properties, access to the land for the loading and unloading of watercraft, and temporary moorage. The importance of waterways in providing public access from dry land to the water is also recognized.

 LU243 Public access shall be the preferred use for recaptured rights- of-way. Public rights-of-way may be used or developed for uses other than public access, provided that such uses are determined by the City to be in the public interest, and that public access of substantial quality and at least comparable to the right-of-way is provided.

 LU244 Shorelines street ends are a valuable resource for public use and access. Public or private use or development of street ends shall be designed to enhance rather than reduce public access.

 LU245 Provide public transportation convenient to the shoreline.

 Conservation

 LG48 Preserve, protect and restore areas such as those necessary for the support of wild and aquatic life or those identified as having geological or biological significance.

 LG49 Insure that all future uses will preserve and protect environmental systems, including wild and aquatic life.

 LG50 Insure continuing scientific study of Seattle shoreline ecosystems.

 LU246 Protect the natural environment through use and development standards governing shoreline activities including best management practices.

 LU247 Areas identified as special wildlife or fisheries habitat should be developed only if no reasonable alternative locations exist and then only if the project is designed to minimize and mitigate habitat damage.

 LU248 Require that all commercial, industrial or other high activity uses provide means for treating natural or artificial urban run-off to acceptable standards. Developments with industrial and commercial uses that use or process substances potentially harmful to public health and/or aquatic life shall provide means to prevent, to the extent possible, point and non-point discharge of the harmful substances.

 LU249 Dredging and disposal of dredge materials shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes short and long-term environmental damage.

 LU250 Permit landfill on submerged land that does not create dry land where necessary for a water-dependent or water-related use, for the installation of a bridge or utility line or for wildlife or fisheries habitat mitigation or enhancement. Permit landfill that creates dry land only where necessary for the operation of a water-dependent or water-related use, to repair pocket erosion, or for wildlife habitat mitigation or enhancement. Large amounts of dry land may be created in Lake Union only if specifically approved by the Council for a public park purpose.

 LU251 Identify those areas that have potential for restoration to "natural" conditions, develop standards for the conditions in those areas, and provide incentives for achieving such standards.

 LU252 Support programs that inform the public about shoreline conservation practices, and identify methods by which public and private shoreline owners or community groups may encourage wild, aquatic and botanical life, and require such methods when appropriate.

 LU253 Support the study of the shoreline systems that will provide a continuously updated baseline against which to judge the impact of any action.

 Economic Development

 LG51 Encourage economic activity and development of water-dependent uses by supporting the retention and expansion of existing water- dependent businesses and planning for the creation of new developments in areas now dedicated to such use.

 LG52 Allow a multi-use concept of development, provided that the major use is water-dependent and that it provides public access to the shoreline yet maintains the economic viability of the use.

 LU254 Concentrate industrial and commercial shoreline uses by supporting the retention and expansion of existing water-dependent businesses, and planning for the creation of new developments in areas now dedicated to such use.

 LU255 Identify and designate appropriate land adjacent to deep water for uses that require such condition, such as industry or commerce.

 LU256 Provide incentives for public amenities on private property.

 LU257 Citywide objectives for different types of water-dependent businesses and industries:

 1. Cargo Handling Facilities:

 a. Reserve space in deep water areas with adequate backup space to permit the Port of Seattle and other marine industries to remain competitive with other ports.

 b. Work with the Port of Seattle to develop a long-range harbor plan in order to provide predictability for property owners and private industry in the Duwamish and Elliott Bay.

 2. Tug and Barge Facilities: Retain Seattle's role as the Gateway to Alaska and maintain space for Puget Sound and Pacific trade.

 3. Shipbuilding, Boat building, and Repairs: Maintain a critical mass of facilities in Seattle in order to meet the needs of the diverse fleets that visit or have a home port in Seattle, including fishing, transport, recreation and military vessels.

 4. Moorage: Meet the long-term and transient needs of all of Seattle's ships and boats including fishing, transport, recreation and military. Locate long-term moorage in sheltered areas close to services, and short-term moorage in more open areas. Support the efficient use of Fishermen's Terminal, the Shilshole Marina and other public moorage facilities. Reduce the displacement of ccommercial moorage by recreational moorage by encouraging the full use of submerged lands for recreational moorage in areas less suited for commercial moorage. Require large recreational marinas to provide some commercial transient moorage as part of their facilities.

 5. Recreational Boating: Maintain Seattle's unofficial status as a "boating capital." Allow a variety of boating facilities from launching ramps for small "car top" boats to major marinas. Provide long-term recreational moorage for residents and sufficient short-term moorage close to cultural and recreational centers for visitors.

 6. Passenger Terminals: Maintain and expand the opportunity for residents and visitors for convenient travel by ship to local and distant ports. Encourage more passenger-only ferries and cruise ships on the Central Waterfront.

 7. Fishing Industry: Maintain a critical mass of support services including boat building and repair, moorage, fish processors, and supply houses to permit Seattle fishermen to continue to service and have a home-port for their vessels in Seattle waters. Recognize the importance of the local fishing industry in supplying local markets and restaurants. Recognize the economic contribution of distant water fisheries to Seattle's maritime and general economy.

 Recreation

 LG53 Manage publicly owned shorelines that are suitable for public recreation to optimize their potential.

 LG54 Increase the amount of shorelines dedicated to public recreation and open space.

 LG55 Identify, protect and reserve for public use and/or enjoyment those areas containing special shoreline qualities that cannot be easily duplicated.

 LU258 Allow for increased opportunity for the public to enjoy water- dependent recreation including boating, fishing, swimming, diving and enjoyment of views.

 LU259 Designate as suited for water-dependent recreation areas having natural beaches, large amounts of submerged land for moorage or sheltered waters and the absence of heavy ship traffic and incompatible heavy industry.

 LU260 Provide for recreational boating facilities including terminals, moorage and service facilities on publicly-owned land and encourage the provision of such facilities on private property, if the environmental impact is acceptable.

 LU261 Increase publicly-owned shorelines, giving priority to those areas that lack recreational facilities.

 LU262 Explore alternative means (other than acquisition) to provide public recreation at the shoreline and on the water.

 LU263 Use submerged lands for underwater parks when feasible.

 History, Culture, Restoration and Enhancement

 LG56 Appropriately designate sites and areas of shoreline having historic or cultural significance.

 LG57 Support and encourage the restoration of those areas or conditions of the shoreline now unsuitable for private or public use, consistent with economic and environmental goals.

 LG58 Upgrade and/or beautify the public shoreline.

 LU264 Support and encourage the restoration, preservation and maintenance of areas of the shoreline having significant historical or cultural significance, and a program for shoreline restoration and beautification.

 LU265 Consider protection of individual sites or aspects of areas identified as being of historical significance through landmark designation.

 Process

 LG59 Continue shoreline planning by periodically updating the inventory, goals, policies and regulations to respond to changing attitudes and conditions in Seattle's shorelines.

 LU266 Conduct periodic assessments of the performance of and the need for change in the Shoreline Master Program.

 Area Objectives for Seattle's Shorelines

 LG60 Recognize the unique opportunities in different areas of our shorelines to accommodate different types of water-dependent businesses and shoreline recreation, and to protect and enhance natural areas and views of the water.

 LG61 Restore Lower Duwamish Watershed habitat while maintaining the urban industrial nature of the area, its neighborhoods and the importance of sustaining a healthy and diverse working waterfront and marine ecology.

 LG62 Strengthen the vitality of a functioning ecosystem within the Lower Duwamish Watershed by integrating projects into their surrounding environments, by supporting a diversity of habitats, and by strengthening connections between habitats throughout the Watershed.

 LU267 The Lower Duwamish Watershed Habitat Restoration Plan (December, 1996, as may be amended from time to time) should be considered by agencies when conducting planning or permitting activities within the watershed

 LU268 It is the intent of the Area Objectives to indicate which of the Shoreline Areas Goals and Policies are to be met on each specific section of shoreline. The Management System for Appropriate Uses as required by the Shoreline Management Act shall consist of the Area Objectives for the diverse areas of Seattle's shorelines, the purposes of the shoreline environments, the shoreline environment designations, and the use regulations and development standards of the Land Use Code.

 LU269 The area objectives for Seattle Shorelines illustrated in Land Use Figure 1 are as follows:

 1. Area Objectives For Shorelines Of Statewide Significance

 a. Puget Sound (Residential/Recreational Areas)

 (The Puget Sound area includes all of the shorelines on Puget Sound within the City limits, except the Shilshole area, Elliott Bay, the Harborfront and the Duwamish Waterways.)

 * Protect the fragile ecology of the natural beaches and fish migration routes.

 * Encourage and enhance shoreline recreational activities, particularly in developed parks.

 * Provide for quality public access to the shoreline.

 * Preserve and enhance views of the water.

 * Protect areas developed for residential use in a manner consistent with the Single-family and Multi-family Residential Area Policies.

 b. Elliott Bay

 (The Elliott Bay area is all shoreline area from 24th Avenue West to SW Atlantic Street, except the Harborfront, Harbor Island and the Duwamish Waterways.)

 * Reserve waterfront lots for major port terminals, large water- dependent and water-related manufacturing and industrial facilities, and major water-dependent recreational developments.

 * Choose shoreline environments that are appropriate for recreational and industrial uses based on water depth, amount of dry land, topography, and truck and rail access.

 * Protect and enhance migratory fish routes and feeding areas.

 c. Harborfront (Central Waterfront)

 (The Harborfront area is the shoreline area from Bay Street on the north to S. Jackson Street on the south.)

 * Encourage economically viable marine uses to meet the needs of waterborne commerce.

 * Facilitate the revitalization of downtown's waterfront.

 * Provide opportunities for public access and recreational enjoyment of the shoreline.

 * Preserve and enhance elements of historic and cultural significance.

 * Preserve views of Elliott Bay and the land forms beyond.

 d. The Duwamish

 (The Duwamish area includes the Duwamish river from the south city limits north to South Massachusetts on the east side and Southwest Bronson Street on the west side, and including Harbor Island and the East and West Duwamish Waterways.)

 * Preserve the statewide interest by encouraging industrial and port uses in this area, where such uses are already concentrated, while also protecting migratory fish routes.

 * Protect Kellogg Island as an important natural resource for fish and wildlife habitat and the opportunity for the public to view those resources.

 * Work with appropriate government agencies and shoreline users to reduce the input of pollutants, restore contaminated areas and regulate disposal of dredge spoils.

 * Increase public access and recreational opportunities through the Duwamish Public Access Plan.

 e. The Shilshole Area

 (The Shilshole area is the shoreline area from Northwest 80th Street on the north, to the Chittenden Locks.)

 * Retain the strong, water-dependent recreational character of the area. Water-dependent recreational uses and their supporting services are the preferred uses for this area.

 * Permit non-water-dependent commercial uses when providing access to the water, protecting views and not usurping land usable for future water-dependent recreational uses.

 * On waterfront lots, new residential uses may be permitted when adjacent to existing residences. Protect the fish migration routes.

 f. Lake Washington and Union Bay

 (The Lake Washington area is the shoreline area on Lake Washington from the north to south city limits, including Union Bay, to the Montlake Bridge.)

 * Preserve the resources of natural areas and fish migration, feeding areas and spawning areas.

 * Provide quality public access to the shoreline by encouraging and enhancing shoreline recreational activities, particularly in developed parks.

 * Preserve and enhance views of the water.

 * Protect developed residential and commercial areas in a manner consistent with adopted land use policies.

 Union Bay

 * Protect fragile natural environments.

 * Provide opportunities for the public to enjoy the natural environment.

 2. Area Objectives For Other Shoreline Areas

 a. The Ship Canal

 (The Ship Canal area includes the Lake Washington Ship Canal from the Chittenden Locks to the Fremont Bridge.)

 * Retain and encourage the important role that the Ship Canal plays in state, regional and local fisheries by reserving the Ship Canal primarily for water-dependent and water-related uses. Non-water- dependent uses shall be restricted, prohibited or allowed only on a limited basis by the selection of shoreline environments that favor water-dependent uses.

 * Encourage the development of non-water-dependent commercial, institutional and manufacturing uses on those areas of the Fremont Cut that do not have water access.

 b. Lake Union and Portage Bay

 (The Lake Union area is all of Lake Union from the Fremont Bridge to the Montlake Bridge, and all of Portage Bay, from the I-5 Bridge to the Montlake Bridge.)

 * Maintain and encourage a diversity of uses around Lake Union and Portage Bay by designating different areas of the shoreline with different shoreline environments.

 * Retain the working character of Lake Union by reserving those areas of the lake's shorelines that are suitable for water- dependent uses for the use of marine businesses. Prohibit new residential uses on industrial shorelines.

 * Allow a greater mix of uses, including non-water-dependent uses providing public access, in those areas that are not being preserved for water-dependent uses.

 * Preserve the existing floating home community.

 * Provide a maximum amount of public access in locations that do not conflict with water-dependent manufacturing uses.

 * Provide for some open water and protect views of the Lake and Bay in all environments in Lake Union and Portage Bay.

 * Restore and enhance and Lake's natural environment.

 c. Green Lake

 (The Green Lake area includes the lake, the park and its 200 foot- wide shoreline.)

 * Encourage and enhance the shoreline recreational activities and opportunities in the area as a unique urban park.

 * Explore restoration options for improving water quality, reducing algae and other plant growth, and enhancing sports fishing.

 Height in the Shoreline District

 LU270 The 35-foot height limit of the Shoreline Management Act shall be the standard for maximum height in the Seattle Shoreline District. Exceptions in the development standards of a shoreline environment may be made consistent with the Act and with the underlying zoning where:

 a. A greater height will not obstruct views of a substantial number of residences and the public interest will be served; and

 b. Greater height is necessary for bridges or the operational needs of water dependent or water-related uses or manufacturing uses; or

 c. A reduced height is warranted because of the underlying residential zone; or

 d. A reduced height is warranted because public views or the views of a substantial number of residences could be blocked.

 ATTACHMENT 2 TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT

 A. Building Urban Villages: Land Use and Transportation

 Discussion: The development pattern described in the Urban Village Element of this Plan will shape the city's transportation facilities. In particular, transportation facility design will reflect the intended pedestrian nature of the urban centers and villages and the desire to connect these places with transit service. Because Seattle is a fully built city with a mature street system, the City uses a full range of non-single occupant vehicle transportation facilities to support the desired redevelopment pattern within Urban Villages. These facilities can help create the mixed-use, walkable, transit and bike-friendly centers that this Plan envisions. However, the City recognizes that auto and service access to property will remain important for accommodating growth in centers and villages.

 Outside of urban centers and villages, the City will also look for appropriate transportation designs that align transportation facilities and services with adjacent land uses.

 This Element contains references to the Transportation Strategic Plan, which is the functional plan developed to implement these policies.

 TG1 Ensure that transportation decisions, strategies and investments are coordinated with land use goals and support the urban village strategy.

 T1 Design transportation infrastructure in urban villages to support land use goals for compact, accessible, walkable neighborhoods.

 T2 Make the design and scale of transportation facilities compatible with planned land uses and with consideration for the character anticipated by this Plan for the surrounding neighborhood.

 T3 Encourage and provide opportunities for public involvement in planning and designing of City transportation facilities, programs, and services, and encourage other agencies to do the same.

 T4 Provide sufficient transportation facilities and services to promote and accommodate the growth this Plan anticipates in urban centers, urban villages, and manufacturing/industrial centers while reducing reliance on single occupancy vehicles.

 T5 Establish multi-modal hubs providing transfer points between transit modes in urban centers and urban villages.

 B. Make the Best Use of the Streets We Have to Move People and Goods

 Discussion: The City has a limited amount of street space, and is unlikely to expand this space significantly. To make the best use of existing rights-of-way for moving people and goods, the City must allocate street space carefully among competing uses to further the City's growth management and transportation goals.

 TG2 Manage the street system safely and efficiently for all modes and users and seek to balance limited street capacity among competing uses.

 TG3 Promote safe and convenient bicycle and pedestrian access throughout the transportation system.

 TG4 Promote adequate capacity on the street system for transit and other designated uses.

 TG5 Preserve and maintain the boulevard network as both a travel and open space system.

 TG6 Promote efficient freight and goods movement.

 TG7 Protect neighborhood streets from through traffic.

 T9 Allocate street space among various uses (e.g., traffic, transit, trucks, carpools, bicycles, parking, and pedestrians) to enhance the key function(s) of a street as described in the Transportation Strategic Plan.

 T10 Designate, in the Transportation Strategic Plan, a traffic network that defines Interstate Freeways, Regional, Principal, Minor and Collector Arterial streets, Commercial and Residential Access streets and Alleys as follows:

 Interstate Freeways: roadways that provide the highest capacity and least impeded traffic flow for longer vehicle trips.

 Regional Arterials: roadways that provide for intra-regional travel and carry traffic through the city or serve important traffic generators, such as regional shopping centers, a major university, or sports stadia.

 Principal Arterials: roadways that are intended to serve as the primary routes for moving traffic through the city connecting urban centers and urban villages to one another, or to the regional transportation network.

 Minor Arterials: roadways that distribute traffic from principal arterials to collector arterials and access streets.

 Collector Arterials: roadways that collect and distribute traffic from principal and minor arterials to local access streets or provide direct access to destinations.

 Commercial Access Streets: roadways that directly serve commercial and industrial land uses and provide localized traffic circulation.

 Residential Access Streets: roadways that provide access to neighborhood land uses and access to higher level traffic streets.

 Alleys: travelways that provide access to the rear of residences and businesses that are not intended for the movement of through trips. Where a continuous alley network exists, it is the preferred corridor for utility facilities.

 T11 Establish a street system that can accommodate the weight of heavy vehicles and reduce the damage such vehicles can cause.

 T12 Designate, in the Transportation Strategic Plan, a transit network to maintain and improve transit mobility and access, compatible with the transportation infrastructure and surrounding land uses. Through the network, focus transit investments and indicate expected bus volumes and transit priority treatments appropriate for the type and condition of the street.

 T13 Designate, in the Transportation Strategic Plan, a truck street classification network to accommodate trucks and to preserve and improve commercial transportation mobility and access. Designate as follows:

 Major Truck Streets: an arterial street that accommodates significant freight movement through the city, and connects to major freight traffic generators.

 T14 Designate, in the Transportation Strategic Plan, a bicycle classification network to accommodate bicycle trips through the City and to major destinations. Designate as follows:

 Urban Trails: a network of on- and off-street trails that facilitate walking and bicycling as viable transportation choices, provide recreational opportunities, and link major parks and open spaces with Seattle neighborhoods, as shown on Figure 1.

 Streets: an on-street bicycle network that connects neighborhoods and urban centers and villages and serves major inter-modal connections.

 T15 Designate, in the Transportation Strategic Plan, a network of boulevards that provides for circulation and access in a manner that enhances the appreciation or use of adjacent major parklands and vistas and preserves the historic character of the boulevards.

[Transportation Figure 1 - Seattle Urban Trails System 2000](/~ordpics/115137At1TransFig1.gif)

 T16 Designate, in the Transportation Strategic Plan, a Street Type overlay to define street use and design features that support adjacent land uses, generally, as follows:

 Main Street: Main activity center in urban villages for pedestrians and transit. This Street Type encourages and supports pedestrian and bicycle activity as well as transit. Streets in this type may include high capacity transit stops and are distinguished by compact, mixed land uses, and high densities.

 Mixed Use Street: Streets within neighborhood commercial areas of the city. This Street Type supports all modes with an emphasis on pedestrian access.

 Regional Connector Street: Provide connections between regional centers along principal arterials. This Street Type supports all modes but is primarily designed to provide citywide and regional access for transit, cars and truck trips and may support high and intermediate capacity transit service.

 Commercial Connector Street: Provide connections between commercial areas as well as local access within urban villages along minor arterials streets. This Street Type supports all modes with an emphasis on local access.

 Local Connector Street: This Street Type supports pedestrian access along Collector Arterials to and from key pedestrian generators and destinations (e.g. schools, community centers, transit stops). May also be non-arterial streets that provide direct connection to high capacity transit stops.

 Industrial Access Street: This Street Type supports freight access to manufacturing and industrial land uses.

 Green Street: This Street Type on certain downtown streets provides exceptional pedestrian environments and may include wider sidewalks, street trees, landscaping, and appropriate street furniture emphasizing pedestrian movement.

 Neighborhood Green Street: May be on any non-arterial street adjacent to residential and commercial land uses. This Street Type supports all modes with an emphasis on pedestrian amenities, street trees and landscaping.

 T17 Use neighborhood traffic control devices and strategies to protect local streets from through traffic, high volumes, high speeds, and pedestrian/vehicle conflicts. Use these devices and strategies on collector arterials where they are compatible with the basic function of collector arterials.

 T18 Increase capacity on roadways only if needed to improve safety, improve connectivity of the transportation network improve isolated connections to regional roadways, or where other measures are impractical to achieve level-of-service standards. The City will manage capacity of principal arterials where and as appropriate and will not attempt to provide street space to meet latent demand for travel by car. The City will not support freeway expansion for the sole purpose of increasing general traffic capacity.

 T19 Recognize the important function of alleys in the transportation network. Consider alleys, especially continuous alleys, a valuable resource for access to abutting properties to load/unload, locate utilities, and dispose of waste.

 C. Increasing Transportation Choices

 Discussion: To reduce car use, the City will employ land use policies and parking strategies that encourage increased use of transit, walking, biking, and carpooling. To be effective, the City must provide for transportation alternatives and educate people on transportation choices. These kinds of tools enable the City to manage, or control, the need to travel by car. Transportation alternatives to the single occupancy-vehicle (SOV) need to address cost, convenience, and travel time. The City recognizes that transportation needs and travel choices will change over time as alternatives to car travel become more viable.

 TG8 Meet the current and future mobility needs of residents, businesses, and visitors with a balanced transportation system.

 TG9 Provide programs and services to promote transit, bicycling, walking, and carpooling to help reduce car use and SOV trips.

 TG10 Accommodate all new trips in downtown with non-SOV modes.

 TG11 Strive to achieve the following mode choice goals for use of travel modes through the City's land use strategies and transportation programs:

 Mode Choice Goals for Work Trips to Seattle and its Urban Centers Proportion of work trips made using Non-SOV Modes

 Urban Center 2000* 2010 Goal 2020 Goal Downtown 56% 62% 70% 1st Hill/Capitol Hill 31% 37% 50% Uptown/Queen Anne 33% 37% 50% South Lake Union 30% 37% 50% University District 56% 62% 70% Northgate 26% 30% 40% Seattle 39% 42% 45%

 * 2000 mode choice numbers are from the U.S. Census for the year 2000 journey to work data by place of employment.

 Mode Choice Goals for residents of Seattle and its Urban Centers Proportion of all trips made using Non-SOV Modes.

 Urban Center 2000* 2010 Goal 2020 Goal Downtown 77% 80% 85% 1st Hill/Capitol Hill 69% 75% 80% Uptown/Queen Anne 64% 70% 75% South Lake Union 65% 70% 75% University District 60% 65% 70% Northgate 50% 55% 60% Seattle 53% 55% 60%

 * 2000 mode choice numbers are preliminary estimates from the Puget Sound Regional Council Regional Travel Demand Model (2004 preliminary model update) for Home-Based Work and Home-Based Non-Work Trips.

 T20 Provide, support, and promote programs and strategies aimed at reducing the number of car trips and miles driven (for work and non- work purposes) to increase the efficiency of the transportation system.

 T21 Promote public awareness of the impact travel choices have on household finances, personal quality of life, society, and the environment, and increase awareness of the range of travel choices available.

 T22 Pursue transportation demand management (TDM) strategies at the regional level, and strengthen regional partnerships working on TDM measures. Coordinate with regional and state partners so customers see their travel choices and the various TDM promotions as a coordinated, integrated system that makes a difference in the community.

 C-1 Increasing Transportation Choices - Making Transit a Real Choice

 Discussion: Providing convenient and accessible transit service can help reduce reliance on single-occupant vehicles, slow the increase in environmental degradation associated with their use, and increase mobility without building new streets and highways. Street rights-of- way are limited and as streets get more congested, transit provides an efficient way to move large numbers of people around the city and the region and support growth in urban centers and villages. These policies will guide City decisions to enhance transit, and are also intended to guide decisions of transit serving Seattle.

 TG12 Create a transit-oriented transportation system that builds strong neighborhoods and supports economic development.

 TG13 Provide mobility and access by public transportation for the greatest number of people to the greatest number of services, jobs, educational opportunities, and other destinations.

 TG14 Increase transit ridership, and thereby reduce use of single- occupant vehicles to reduce environmental degradation and the societal costs associated with their use.

 T23 Work with transit providers to provide transit service that is fast, frequent, and reliable between urban centers and urban villages and that is accessible to most of the city's residences and businesses. Pursue strategies that make transit safe, secure, comfortable, and affordable.

 T24 Support development of an integrated, regional high capacity transit system that l links urban centers within the city and the region.

 T25 Pursue a citywide intermediate capacity transit system that connects urban centers, urban villages and manufacturing/industrial centers.

 T26 Pursue a citywide local transit system that connects homes and businesses with neighborhood transit facilities.

 T27 Work with transit providers to design and operate transit facilities and services to make connections within the transit system and other modes safe and convenient. Integrate transit stops, stations, and hubs into existing communities and business districts to make it easy for people to ride transit and reach local businesses. Minimize negative environmental and economic impacts of transit service and facilities on surrounding areas.

 T28 Work with transit providers to ensure that the design of stations and alignments will improve how people move through and perceive the city, contribute positively to Seattle's civic identity and reflect the cultural identity of the communities in which they are located.

 T29 Discourage the development of major, stand-alone park-and-ride facilities within Seattle. Situations where additions to park-and- ride capacity could be considered include:

 * At the terminus for a major, regional transit system;

 * Opportunities exist for "shared parking" (e.g., where transit commuter parking can be leased from another development, such as a shopping center, movie theater, or church); and

 * Areas where alternatives to automobile use are particularly inadequate (e.g., lack of direct transit service, or pedestrian and bicycle access) or cannot be provided in a cost-effective manner.

 T30 Encourage transit services that address the needs of persons with disabilities, the elderly, other people with special needs, and people who depend on public transit for their mobility.

 T31 Support efficient use of ferries to move passengers and goods to and from Seattle. Encourage the Washington State Ferry System to expand its practice of giving loading and/or fare priority to certain vehicles, such as transit, carpools, vanpools, bicycles, and/or commercial vehicles, on particular routes, on certain days of the week, and/or at certain times of day. Encourage the Ferry System to integrate transit loading and unloading areas into ferry terminals, and to provide adequate bicycle capacity on ferries and adequate and secure bicycle parking at terminals.

 T32 For water-borne travel across Puget Sound, encourage the expansion of passenger-only ferry service and land-side facilities and terminals that encourage walk-on (by foot, bicycle and transit) trips rather than ferry travel with automobiles.

 C-2 Increasing Transportation Choices - Bicycling and Walking

 Discussion: Walking and bicycling can be practical alternatives to driving, especially for short trips. They can also contribute greatly to neighborhood quality and vitality, and help achieve City transportation, environmental, open space, and public health goals. Pedestrian and bicycle improvements to streets, intersections, sidewalks, and other facilities can improve access and safety. Such facilities are particularly important for children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities.

 TG15 Increase walking and bicycling to help achieve City transportation, environmental, community and public health goals.

 TG16 Create and enhance safe, accessible, attractive and convenient street and trail networks that are desirable for walking and bicycling.

 T33 Improve mobility and safe access for walking and bicycling, and create incentives to promote non-motorized travel to employment centers, commercial districts, transit stations, schools and major institutions, and recreational destinations.

 T34 Integrate pedestrian and bicycle facilities, services, and programs into City and regional transportation and transit systems. Encourage transit providers, the Washington State Ferry System, and others to provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access to and onto transit systems, covered and secure bicycle storage at stations, and especially for persons with disabilities and special needs.

 T35 Recognize that stairways located within Seattle's public rights- of-way serve as a unique and valuable pedestrian resource in some areas of the City. Discourage the vacation of public rights-of-way occupied by stairways, and protect publicly-owned stairways from private encroachment.

 T36 Accelerate the maintenance, development, and improvement of existing pedestrian facilities, including public stairways. Give special consideration to access to recommended school walking routes; access to transit, public facilities, social services and community centers; and access within and between urban villages for people with disabilities and special needs.

 T37 Provide and maintain a direct and comprehensive bicycle network connecting urban centers, urban villages and other key locations. Provide continuous bicycle facilities and work to eliminate system gaps.

 T38 Develop, apply and report on walking and bicycling transportation performance measures in the Transportation Strategic Plan to evaluate the functioning of the non-motorized transportation system; to ensure consistency with current industry standards; to identify strengths, deficiencies and potential improvements; and to support development of new and innovative facilities and programs.

 T39 Promote safe walking, bicycling, and driving behavior so as to provide public health benefits and to reinforce pedestrian, bicycle and motorists' rights and responsibilities.

 C-3 Increasing Transportation Choices - Managing the Parking Supply

 Discussion: Long- or short-term parking is part of every car trip, and parking, especially when free, is a key factor in the mode choice for a trip. The availability and price of parking influences people's housing and transportation choices about where to live and how to travel to work, shop, and conduct personal business. The City's challenge is to provide enough parking to meet mobility and economic needs, while limiting supply to encourage people to use non-auto modes. This section establishes goals and policies primarily for on- street parking. Off-street parking goals and policies can be found in the Land Use Element, parking section.

 TG17 Manage the parking supply to achieve vitality of urban centers and villages, auto trip reduction, and improved air quality.

 TG18 Recognize that the primary transportation purpose of the arterial street system is to move people and goods, when making on- street parking decisions.

 T40 Consider establishing parking districts that allow for neighborhood based on- and off-street parking management regulations to help meet urban center mode split goals.

 T41 Use low-cost parking management strategies such as curb space management, shared parking, pricing, parking information and marketing and similar tools to encourage more efficient use of existing parking supply before pursuing more expensive off-street parking facility options.

 T42 Restrict on-street parking when necessary to address safety, operational or mobility problems. In urban centers and urban villages where such restriction is being considered, the pedestrian environment and transit operations are of primary concern, but decisions should also balance the use of the street by high-occupancy vehicles, bicycles and motor vehicles; access to local businesses; control of parking spillover into residential areas; and truck access and loading.

 T43 In commercial districts prioritize curb space in following order: 1) transit stops and layover, 2) passenger and commercial vehicle loading, 3) short-term parking (time limit signs and paid parking); 4) parking for shared vehicles; and 5) vehicular capacity.

 T44 In residential districts, prioritize curb space in the following order: 1) transit stops and layover; 2) passenger and commercial vehicle loading; 3) parking for local residents and for shared vehicles; and 4) vehicular capacity.

 T45 During construction or implementation of new transportation projects, consider replacing short-term parking only when the project results in a concentrated and substantial amount of on-street parking loss.

 T46 Use paid on-street parking to encourage parking turnover, customer access, and efficient allocation of parking among diverse users.

 T47 Consider installing longer-term paid on-street parking along edges of commercial districts or in office and institutional zones to regulate curb space where short-term parking demand is low.

 T48 Strive to allocate adequate parking enforcement resources to encourage voluntary compliance with on-street parking regulations.

 T49 Coordinate Seattle's parking policies with regional parking policies to preserve Seattle's competitive position in the region.

 D Promoting the Economy: Moving Goods and Services

 Discussion: The transport of goods and services is critical to Seattle's and the region's economic development. As a major port city, Seattle's businesses and industries rely on rail, water, and truck transport. These policies, and those in the Economic Development and the Neighborhood Planning elements, support existing businesses and industries, and promote Seattle as a place for economic expansion. Major truck streets are an important part of the freight mobility network and are described in Section B - Make the Best Use of the Streets We Have to Move People and Goods, in this element. The Transportation Strategic Plan has more detailed strategies and street classifications that further support freight mobility in the City of Seattle.

 TG19 Preserve and improve mobility and access for the transport of goods and services.

 TG20 Maintain Seattle as the hub for regional goods movement and as a gateway to national and international suppliers and markets.

 T50 Maintain a forum for the freight community to advise the City and other entities on an ongoing basis on topics of land-based freight transportation facility modifications and enhancements. Coordinate the review of potential operational changes, capital projects and regulations that may impact freight movement. Participate and advocate Seattle's interests in regional and state forums.

 T51 Recognize the importance of the freight network to the city's economic health when making decisions that affect Major Truck streets as well as other parts of the region's roadway system.

 T52 Support efficient and safe movement of goods by rail where appropriate. Promote continued operation of freight rail lines and intermodal yards that serve industrial properties and the transport of goods. Improve the safety and operational conditions for freight rail transport at the rail track crossings within city streets.

 T53 Promote an intermodal freight transportation strategy, including rail, truck, air and water transport and advocate for improved freight and goods movement. Work toward improved multi-modal connections among rail yards, industrial areas, airports, and regional roadways

 T54 Consider the needs for local delivery and collection of goods at businesses by truck when making street operational decisions and when developing and implementing projects and programs for highways, streets, and bridges.

 E. Improving the Environment

 Discussion: The development pattern promoted by the urban village strategy is supported by transportation policies that encourage walking, biking, and transit. Streets that support travel by all modes and that are well designed and maintained and that include landscaping and street trees contribute to a healthy urban environment. Over-reliance on motor vehicles degrades environmental quality in the form of deteriorating air quality, increasing water pollution through street and stormwater runoff, and causing higher levels of noise pollution. Excessive reliance on motor vehicles also negatively affects the quality of life in the city by increasing congestion and travel time.

 TG21 Promote healthy neighborhoods with a transportation system that protects and Improves environmental quality.

 TG22 Reduce or mitigate air, water, and noise pollution from motor vehicles.

 TG23 Promote energy-efficient transportation.

 T55 Design and operate streets to promote healthy urban environments while keeping safety, accessibility and aesthetics in balance.

 T56 Implement an environmental management system to develop, operate and maintain a safe and reliable transportation system in a manner that reduces the environmental impacts of City operations and services.

 T57 Identify, evaluate, and mitigate environmental impacts of transportation investments and operating decisions (including impacts on air and water quality, noise, environmentally critical areas and endangered species). Pursue transportation projects, programs, and investment strategies consistent with noise reduction, air quality improvement, protection of critical areas and endangered species, and water quality improvement objectives.

 T58 Coordinate with other city, county, regional, state, and federal agencies to pursue opportunities for air and water quality improvement, street and stormwater runoff prevention, and noise reduction.

 T59 Continue to work to reduce fuel use and promote the use of alternative fuels.

 F. Connecting to the Region

 Discussion: Seattle is a regional destination and is also the focus of a number of major regional transportation facilities. Much of the rest of the Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element considers transportation within the city limits. This section provides guidance for regional projects that affect Seattle and for Seattle's participation in regional planning and funding efforts.

 TG24 Actively engage other agencies to assure that regional projects and programs affecting the city are consistent with City plans, policies and priorities.

 T60 Support regional pricing and parking strategies that contribute to transportation demand management objectives and to economic development.

 T61 Coordinate with regional, state and federal agencies, local governments, and transit providers when planning and operating transportation facilities and services in order to promote regional mobility for people and goods and the urban center approach to growth management.

 T62 Support completion of the freeway high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lane system throughout the central Puget Sound region. Maintain the HOV system for its intended purpose of promoting non-SOV travel.

 T63 Expansion of freeway capacity should be limited primarily to accommodate non-SOV users. Spot expansion of capacity to improve safety or remove operational constraints may be appropriate in specific locations.

 T64 Support a strong regional ferry system that maximizes the movement of people, freight, and goods.

 G. Conserving Transportation Resources: Operating and Maintaining the Transportation System

 Discussion: Successful operation and maintenance of the transportation system promotes safety, efficiency, infrastructure preservation, and a high quality environment. Maintenance costs consume 75 to 80% of the Seattle Department of Transportation's annual operating budget. This investment represents a significant and recurring commitment to the conservation of our city's transportation facilities, as dollars spent on maintenance today help ensure that more dollars are not needed for premature replacement later. Effective maintenance of the transportation system means the City will have to plan for future maintenance activity and must also address the significant backlog of unmet maintenance needs that currently exists. The policies below guide transportation system operating and maintenance decisions of the City.

 TG25 Promote the safe and efficient operation of Seattle's transportation system.

 TG26 Preserve and renew Seattle's transportation system.

 T65 In operating the transportation system, balance the following priorities: safety, mobility, accessibility, infrastructure preservation and citizen satisfaction.

 T66 Maintain the transportation system to keep it operating safely and to maximize its useful life.

 T67 Repair transportation facilities before replacement is warranted. Replace failed facilities when replacement is more cost-effective than continuing to repair.

 H. Measuring Levels of Service

 Discussion: The Growth Management Act requires that the Comprehensive Plan include level-of-service (LOS) standards for all locally-owned arterials and transit routes to judge the performance of the system. The LOS standards identify minimally acceptable travel conditions on arterials and the transit network. The City has decided to use a system-wide method as a basis to assess the performance of the transportation system. Because buses are the primary from of transit service in the City and buses operate in the same traffic stream as cars, the City has chosen to use the same technique to measure the operation of both forms of travel

 The City's facilities currently comply with the standards in Policies T68 and T69 below.

 TG27 Use level-of-service standards, as required by the Growth Management Act, as a gauge to judge the performance of the arterial and transit system.

 T68 Define arterial level-of-service (LOS) to be the ratio of measured traffic volumes to calculated roadway capacity at designated screenlines, each of which encompasses one or more arterials, as shown in Transportation Figure 2. Measure peak hour directional traffic volumes on the arterials crossing each screenline to calculate the screenline LOS. To judge the performance of the arterial system, compare the calculated LOS for each screenline with the LOS standard for that screenline shown in Transportation Figure 3.

 T69 Define transit level-of-service (LOS) to be the ratio of measured traffic volumes to calculated roadway capacity at designated screen lines, each of which encompasses one or more arterials, on some of which transit operates, as shown in Transportation Figure 2. Measure peak hour directional traffic volumes on the arterials crossing each screenline to calculate the screenline LOS. To judge the performance of the transit system, compare the calculated LOS for each screenline with the LOS standard for that screenline shown in Transportation Figure 3.

 T70 When the calculated LOS for a screenline approaches the LOS standard for that screenline, first pursue strategies to reduce vehicular travel demand across the screenline before increasing the operating capacity across the screenline.

 I Financing the Transportation System

 Discussion: Without funding, the goals identified in this Element would be difficult to achieve. This section identifies goals and policies related to providing and prioritizing funds for transportation projects, programs and services. It also identifies the types of multi-year investment plans to be developed as part of the Transportation Strategic Plan process.

 TG28 Recognize and promote the urban village strategy when making transportation investments.

 TG29 Work towards transportation funding levels adequate to maintain and improve the transportation system.

 T71 Make strategic transportation investment decisions that are consistent with other policies in this Plan, with the Transportation Strategic Plan, and with funding opportunities that promote the city's transportation investment priorities. These investment decisions will also be made with consideration to future operating and maintenance costs associated with improvements

 T72 Support regional and local transit resource allocations, as well as efforts to increase overall transit funding that are consistent with the City's urban village strategy and the regions' urban center policies.

 T73 Pursue strategies to finance repair of road damage from heavy vehicles in a way that is equitable for Seattle's taxpayers.

 T74 Fund projects, programs and services with a combination of local and non-local funds, including:

 * Contributions from other entities that benefit from an investment, such as property owners nearby an investment;

 * Grants and other investments from local, regional, state, and federal funding sources;

 * Contributions from the region for investments that serve regionally- designated urban centers and regional facilities.

 T76 Consider new funding sources that are flexible, equitable and sustainable, including:

 * Growth- and development-related revenues, including impact fees, where appropriate and where consistent with economic development policies;

 * User-based taxes and fees, including a commercial parking tax; and

 * Other locally generated revenues.

 T77 Support regional, state and federal initiatives to increase transportation funding. Work to encourage new and existing funding sources that recognize Seattle's needs and priorities.

 T78 Consistent with the other policies in this Plan and the Transportation Strategic Plan:

 * Prepare a six-year CIP that includes projects that are fully or partially funded;

 * As part of the Transportation Strategic Plan, prepare an intermediate-range list of projects for which the City plans to actively pursue funds over the next approximately 8 to 10 years, and

 * Maintain a long-range working list of potential projects and known needs.

 T79 If the level of transportation funding anticipated in the six- year financial analysis, below (Figure 4), falls short, the Department of Finance and the Seattle Department of Transportation will:

 * Identify and evaluate possible additional funding resources; and/or

 * Identify and evaluate alternative land use and transportation scenarios, including assumptions about levels and distribution of population and employment, densities, types and mixes of land use, and transportation facilities and services, and assess their affects on transportation funding needs.

 The City may then revise the Comprehensive Plan as warranted to ensure that level-of-service standards will be met.

 Six-Year Financial Analysis

 Transportation Figures 4 and 5 show preliminary estimated transportation revenues and expenditures for the six-year period from 2004 through 2009, based on the City's past experiences and on the investment policies of this plan.

 ATTACHMENT 3 HOUSING ELEMENT

 A. Accommodating Growth and Maintaining Affordability

 Discussion:

 Housing affordability is influenced in part by regional and local land use policies, development regulations and permit processes. ~~Policies, regulations and regulatory processes should be designed to maintain overall housing affordability, while at the same time meeting other important goals of the plan, such as maintaining neighborhood character and preserving the environment.~~

This~~e~~ Plan ~~is intended to help~~ accommodates Seattle's portion of expected regional housing demand, in part created by expected employment growth in Seattle. Because Seattle's housing market is influenced by the regional housing market, Seattle and other jurisdictions in the region need to plan cooperatively.

This~~e~~ Plan provides for sufficient unused residential development capacity to allow the market to develop housing to meet expected demand, thus reducing upward pressure on average housing prices and rents. The ~~policies are also intended to~~Plan  encourages residential developers to develop in Seattle by holding down regulatory components of housing costs, ~~thus reducing~~and controlling the cost of developing new housing.

 Goals

 HG1 Accommodate ~~a range of 50,000 to 60,000~~47,000 additional households over the~~next~~ 20 years covered by this Plan.

 HG2 Maintain housing affordability over the life of this Plan.

 HG3 Achieve greater predictability in project approval timelines, achievable densities and mitigation costs.

 Policies

 H1 Coordinate the City's growth management planning with other jurisdictions in the region in order to provide adequate regional development capacity to accommodate expected residential growth and anticipated demand for different types of housing.

 H2 Maintain sufficient zoned development capacity to accommodate Seattle's projected share of King County household growth over the next 20 years as ~~provided for and~~ described in the ~~land use~~Urban Village Element.

 H3 Take a ~~proactive and~~leadership role in regional efforts to increase affordable housing preservation and production in order to ensure a balanced regional commitment to affordable housing, while also maintaining the City's commitment to affordable housing.

 H4 Continue to permit residential development in all land use zones, but generally limit residential development in industrial zones and certain shoreline overlay zones; continue to encourage residential uses in mixed-use development in downtown and neighborhood commercial zones.

 H5 Provide for lower off-street parking requirements in locations where car ownership rates are low for resident populations, to help reduce housing costs and increase affordability.

 H6 In order to control the effects of regulatory processes on housing price,~~S~~strive to minimize the time taken to process land use and building permits, subject to the need to review projects in accordance with applicable ~~land use~~ regulations. Continue to give priority in the plan review process to permits for very low- income housing.

 H7 Periodically assess the effects of City policies and regulations on housing development costs and overall housing affordability, considering the balance between housing affordability and other objectives such as environmental quality, urban design quality, maintenance of neighborhood character and protection of public health, safety and welfare.

 H8 Consider ~~using zoning, land use regulations and policies, and infrastructure requirements for, among other objectives,~~ providing incentives that encourage public agencies, private property owners and developers to build housing that helps fulfill City policy objectives ~~for housing~~. Examples of development incentives include height and density bonuses, minimum densities and transferable development rights. Consider ~~new~~~~methods and expanded use of~~ programs that make maximum use of City resources such as bridge loans, ~~and~~ credit enhancement, and tax exemptions.

 H9 romote housing preservation, development and ~~housing~~ affordability in coordination with transit plans and in proximity to light rail stations and other transit hubs. Coordinate housing, land use, human services, urban design, infrastructure and environmental strategies to support pedestrian-friendly communities at light rail station areas and other transit hubs.

 B. Encouraging Housing Diversity and Quality

 Discussion:

 The demographic make-up of households in both King County and the City of Seattle is changing. The average age of city residents is increasing, and fewer households have children. Household size has continued to shrink, though more slowly in the 1990s than in previous decades. At the same time, single-family houses, the preferred housing type of many households, have become increasingly expensive and, because of a finite land supply, constitute a declining share of the county's housing stock. Policies in this section  address~~emphasize~~ both the development of new housing and the adaptation of existing housing to meet the needs and preferences of the current and expected residents of the city. Despite trends, the City wants to encourage home ownership opportunities in order to promote a sense of community, encourage investment in housing, and to minimize displacement of low-income residents due to gentrification of neighborhoods. The City also has an interest in safeguarding the condition and quality of the housing stock and in maintaining attractive and livable neighborhoods.

 Seattle's zon~~ed~~ing and development regulations~~development capacity for various types of housing, as established pursuant to the land use element, is~~are intended to allow development of housing that will satisfy varied consumer preferences. Many consumers have a strong preference for single- family homes. To some extent, this preference can be met by ground- related units that may be more affordable than detached houses. Ground-related housing types include townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, ground-related apartments, small cottages, accessory units and single- family homes. These housing types provide yards or play areas immediately adjacent to homes, which are important to families with children. See the Land Use Element ~~policy L76~~ for the City's policy regarding ~~the allowance and location of~~accessory housing.

 Moderate- and high-density multifamily apartments are needed to help accommodate expected housing demand over the next 20 years. This kind of residential development is~~, as they are~~often more affordable than ground-related housing~~units~~ due to the  frequently smaller size of the units. ~~The Seattle Residential Preferential Study revealed a significant market for apartment units in urban centers and urban villages if appropriate amenities are provided. The~~~~land use element therefore,~~ This Plan accommodates the majority of residential growth ~~over the 20-year life of this plan through~~in moderate- and high- density multifamily developments in urban centers and urban villages. As residential growth occurs, it will continue to be important to include affordable housing units in the mix of largely market-rate development.

 Goals

 HG4 Achieve a mix of housing types that are attractive and affordable to a diversity of ages, incomes, household types, household sizes, and cultural backgrounds.

 HG5 Promote households with children and attract a greater share of the county's families with children.

 HG6 Encourage and support accessible design and housing strategies that provide seniors the opportunity to remain in their own neighborhood as their housing needs change.

 HG7 Accommodate a variety of housing types that are attractive and affordable to potential home buyers.

 HG8 Strive to increase the~~Achieve a~~ rate of owner- occupancy of housing ~~no less than the county average owner- occupancy rate~~ over time.

 HG9 Consider new ground-related housing such as townhouses and cottage housing as part of the City's strategy for creating home ownership opportunities.

 HG10 Ensure that housing is safe and habitable.

 HG11 Strive for freedom of choice of housing type and neighborhood for all, regardless of race, color, age, gender, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, political ideology, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability.

 Policies

 H10 Reflect anticipated consumer preferences and housing demand of different submarkets in the mix of housing types and densities permitted under ~~Seattle's zoned development capacity~~the City's Land Use Code. Encourage a range of housing types including, but not limited to: single-family housing; ground-related housing to provide an affordable alternative to single-family ownership; and moderate- and high-density multifamily apartments, which are needed to accommodate most of the growth over the 20-year life of this Plan.

 H11 Strive to make the environment, amenities and housing attributes in urban villages attractive to all income groups, ages and households types.

 H12 Provide affordable housing tools ~~concepts~~~~for neighborhood planning to enable neighborhoods~~ to preserve existing single-family character, while also contributing to the provision of affordable housing.

 H13 Accommodate and encourage, where appropriate, the development of ground-related housing in the city that is attractive and affordable to households with children.

 H14 ~~Neighborhood planning should s~~Strive to have each hub urban village and residential urban village include some ground- related housing capacity~~,~~~~with the exception of residential urban villages and hub urban villages contiguous to downtown~~.

 H15 Allow and encourage a range of housing types for seniors, such as independent living, various degrees of assisted living, and skilled nursing care facilities. Strive to increase opportunities for seniors to live in accessible housing with services nearby.

 H16 Encourage greater ethnic and economic integration of neighborhoods in the city in a manner that does not promote ~~gentrification or~~ the displacement of existing low-income residents from their communities. Strive to allocate housing subsidy resources in a manner that increases opportunities for low-income households, including ethnic minorities, to choose ~~residences located~~ among neighborhoods throughout the city.

 H17 ~~As appropriate and conditions warrant, the City will e~~ Encourage the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) to seek federal, state and private resources to continue preserv~~e~~ing, rehabilitat~~e~~ing or redeveloping its properties in a manner that best serves the needs of Seattle's low-income population,~~. Preservation, rehabilitation and redevelopment should~~ addresses social and economic impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, and results in no net loss of housing affordable to households earning ~~below~~up to 30 percent~~%~~ of area median income.

 H18 Promote methods of more efficiently using or adapting the city's housing stock to enable changing households to remain in the same home or neighborhood for many years. Strategies may include sharing homes, accessory units in single-family zones, housing designs ~~which~~ that are easily augmented to accommodate children ("grow houses"), or other methods considered through neighborhood planning.

 H19 Allow the use of modular housing, conforming to the standards of the State of Washington building and energy codes, and manufactured housing, built to standards established by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Modular and manufactured houses shall be permitted on individual lots in any land use zone where residential uses are permitted.

 H20 Promote and foster, where appropriate, innovative and non- traditional housing types such as co-housing, live/work housing and accessory dwelling units, as alternative means of accommodating residential growth and providing affordable housing options.

 H21 Allow higher residential development densities in moderate density multifamily zones for housing limited to occupancy by low- income elderly and disabled households, ~~based on~~because ofthe lower traffic and parking impacts this type of housing generates.

 H22 Work with financial institutions~~, underwriters of development loans and mortgages,~~ and the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, and others to ~~find and promote solutions to~~ overcome barriers in the real estate finance process that inhibit the development of ~~modest~~affordable single-family houses and condominium projects.

 H23 Encourage employers located within the city to develop employer- assisted housing programs. ~~Provide technical assistance to employers wishing to obtain information on model programs.~~

 H24 Encourage safe and healthy housing free of known hazardous conditions. Require that renter-occupied housing be maintained and operated according to minimum standards established in the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code and other applicable codes~~, as amended from time to time~~. Actively encourage compliance with the codes and seek to inspect on a regular basis multifamily rental structures most likely to have code violations.

 C. Providing Housing Affordable to Low-Income Households Discussion:

 Safe, habitable and affordable housing is a fundamental human need. According to the ~~1990~~2000 U.S. Census, about ~~a quarter~~32 percent~~%~~ of the city's households pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing. ~~or live in overcrowded conditions~~. In order to meet existing and future housing needs, the City can use a variety of methods, including~~will encourage and fund a variety of housing production methods and types with an emphasis on providing housing affordable to households with incomes up to 50% of median income. These may include~~: new construction of low-income housing, rehabilitation of existing low- income housing, conversion of existing non-residential structures, home-sharing, subsidizing low-income units in market-rate buildings and rent subsidy vouchers that eligible households could use to rent housing in the open market. A range of housing types may be produced, including larger apartment buildings, smaller garden apartment structures, single-room occupancy hotels, townhouses, duplexes and single-family houses. Housing may be provided by the public sector (the Seattle Housing Authority and public development authorities), non-profit housing development organizations and social service agencies, private property owners and developers and through other mechanisms such as land trusts and limited-equity cooperatives. Specific strategies and programs for the production and preservation of low-income housing are developed and implemented through the City of Seattle's Consolidated Plan and other programmatic plans.

~~Household median i~~Income levels referred to in this Housing Element are defined as follows: (1) a "low-income household" is any household earning up to 80 percent~~%~~ of the area median income, as defined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development; (2) a "very low-income household" is any household earning -up to 50 percent~~%~~of the area median income; and (3) an "extremely low-income household" is any household earning up to 30 percent~~%~~ of the area median income." "Assisted housing" generally means owner-occupied or rental housing that is subject to restrictions on rent or sales prices as a result of one or more project-based governmental subsidies.

 Goals

 HG12 Reduce the number of low-income households in need of housing ssistance ~~with housing costs~~.

 HG13 Provide new low-income housing through market-rate housing production and assisted housing programs.

 HG14 Preserve existing low-income housing, particularly in urban centers and urban villages where most redevelopment pressure will occur.

 HG15 Disperse housing opportunities for low-income households throughout the city and throughout King County.

 HG16 Achieve a distribution of household incomes in urban centers and urban villages similar to the distribution of incomes found citywide

 HG17 Encourage safe, habitable and affordable housing for existing residents of distressed areas through such means as rehabilitation and adequate maintenance of privately-owned rental housing, increased home ownership opportunities, and community revitalization and development efforts.

 Policies

 H25 Support programs that provide financial assistance to low- income homeowners and owners of low-income rental properties to maintain their properties in adequate condition. For instance, a ~~A~~llocate ~~resources to~~ weatherization resources to achieve energy cost savings for low-income households in owner- and renter-occupied units.~~programs for low-income homeowners and owners of low-income rental properties~~.

 H26 Encourage the development of housing in ways that protect the natural environment, including environmentally critical areas, and that promote energy conservation.

 H27 Encourage the adaptive reuse of existing buildings for residential use. Recognize the challenges faced in reusing older buildings and consider, when revising technical codes, ways to make adaptive reuse more economically feasible.

 H28 Seek opportunities to combine housing preservation and development efforts with historic preservation by either preserving residential structures of historic value or rehabilitating and reusing vacant landmark structures and vacant structures in landmark and/or special review districts for housing. Consider landmark preservation as a factor in evaluating low-income housing project proposals for funding.

H29 Encourage the replacement of occupied housing that is demolished or converted to non-residential use.

 1. Encouraging Housing Affordable to Low-Income Households.

 Policies

 H~~29~~30 Address the city's share of low-income housing needs resulting from expected countywide household growth, consistent with the countywide affordable housing policies, by planning for:

 a. ~~A number of units~~ at least ~~equal to~~ 20 percent~~%~~ of expected household growth to be affordable to households ~~between 0% and~~earningup to 50 percent~~%~~ of median income~~, or between 10,000 and 12,000~~estimated 9,400 affordable units.

 b. ~~A number of units~~ at least ~~equal to~~ 17 percent~~%~~ of expected household growth to be affordable to households earning between 5~~0~~1% and 80% of median income~~, or between 8,500 and 10,200~~estimated 7,990 affordable units.

 Both new housing and existing housing that is acquired, rehabilitated or preserved for long-term low-income occupancy ~~shall~~ count as meeting this policy.

 H31~~0~~ Promote the continued production and preservation of low-income housing through ~~existing~~ incentive zoning mechanisms, which include density and height bonuses and the transfer of development rights. Consider expanding the use of incentive zoning for affordable housing in neighborhoods outside downtown, particularly in urban centers. ~~, particularly in relation to transit-oriented development~~. ~~Allow for new or different incentive zoning provisions designed to produce or preserve low-income housing in downtown if they are adopted as part of neighborhood or subarea plans or where needed to achieve housing development goals.~~

 H32~~1~~ Encourage the preservation of existing low-income housing by: using housing programs and funds to preserve existing housing that is susceptible to redevelopment or gentrification; encouraging acquisition of housing by nonprofit organizations, land trusts or tenants, thereby protecting housing from upward pressure on prices and rents; inspecting renter-occupied housing for compliance with the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code; and making available funds for emergency, code-related repair.

~~Allow sub-area plans resulting from neighborhood planning to permit the transfer of unused development rights from low-income housing to eligible sites elsewhere in the planning area as a preservation strategy.~~

 H33~~2~~ Give special consideration to actions that can help maintain the affordability of housing occupied by artists in areas that are recognized as established artist communities, such as Pioneer Square.

 H34~~3~~ Encourage affordable housing citywide.

 a. Plan for at least one-quarter of the housing stock in the city to be affordable to households with incomes ~~below~~up to 50 percent~~%~~ of the area median income, regardless of whether this housing is publicly assisted or available in the private market.

 b. Encourage the use of public subsidy funds for the production or preservation of low-income housing in urban centers and urban villages.

 c. Encourage the production of housing affordable to households of all incomes, with particular emphasis on households with incomes ~~from 0~~up to 50 percent~~%~~ of the area median income in centers and villages with high land values and/or relatively little existing rental housing affordable to households in that~~with~~ income range~~s from 0 50% of median income~~

 d. Encourage all neighborhoods and urban villages to participate in the City's commitment to affordable housing, whether through neighborhood planning, station area planning, or other local planning and development activities.

 2. Publicly Subsidized Low-Income Housing

 H35~~4~~ Strive to make some resources available to all household types (such as families and single-person households) in need of affordable housing options through the mix of housing programs in the city; however, emphasize~~s~~~~shall be placed on~~ assisting households most in need due to very low-incomes or ~~because of~~to special needs that the housing market is unable to serve. Direct a~~A~~ffordable housing funds administered by the City ~~shall be used~~ to serve households with incomes ~~at or below~~up to 80 percent~~%~~ of the area median income, consistent with local, state and federal law and program requirements.

 H36~~5~~ Promote a broader geographical distribution of ~~assisted~~subsidized rental housing by generally funding projects in areas with less ~~assisted~~subsidized rental housing and generally restricting funding for projects in neighborhoods outside of downtown where there are high concentrations of ~~assisted~~subsidized rental housing.

 a. The specific rules implementing this policy and the conditions for allowing exceptions for particular projects are established by the City Council in the HUD Consolidated Plan and other City policies. The HUD Consolidated Plan may also include additional geographic- specific restrictions on, or exceptions for, ~~assisted~~ subsidized rental housing in order to further housing goals as defined in this Comprehensive Plan or~~such as in special objective areas defined in a~~ neighborhood plan~~s~~.

 b. Encourage developers of projects funded with resources not administered by the City of Seattle and the providers of those resources to follow the City's policies for the geographic distribution of ~~assisted~~subsidized rental housing.

 H37~~6~~ Require sponsors of City-funded ~~assisted~~ subsidized rental housing projects and encourage sponsors of non- City-funded ~~assisted~~subsidized rental housing projects to use the City's good neighbor guidelines. This should encourage cooperative problem solving as early as possible in the process of developing ~~assisted~~subsidized rental housing, in order to identify and, where appropriate, respond to neighborhood concerns.

 H38~~7~~ Allocate public funds administered by the City to develop and preserve affordable rental housing for low-income, very low-income and extremely low-income households in conformity with applicable income limits in City ordinances~~, as in effect from time to time,~~ that govern the use of each fund source.

 H39~~8~~ Seek to promote home ownership in the city in a variety of housing types by:

 a. Using a portion of local discretionary housing subsidy resources to provide home ownership opportunities to low-income households, in conformity with applicable income limits in City ordinances~~, as in effect from time to time,~~ that govern the use of each fund source.

 b. ~~Considering a set-aside of a portion of any new discretionary funding sources for assisted housing that would provide home ownership opportunities for low-income households. Also, c~~Consider alternative approaches to increase the development of affordable home ownership housing, including but not limited to greater use of land trusts and limited equity cooperatives.

 H40~~39~~Strive over time for a~~match the assisted~~ permanent subsidized rental housing stock with unit types and sizes that reflect the housing needs of the city's low- income households ~~to household types and sizes in need of assistance~~.

 H41~~0~~~~Set subsidies per~~~~unit for~~Provide affordable housing for low-income families with children, recognizing that ~~this type of~~ family housing requires greater ~~per-unit productions costs~~subsidies due to larger household size, the need for play areas for children, and ~~the~~ separation of parking and access roads from play areas.

 H42~~1~~~~Allow higher subsidy or production costs per housing unit when evaluating low-income housing project proposals in locations with higher than average land costs in order to e~~E ncourage and support the development of ~~low-income~~ affordable housing for low-income households in all parts of ~~throughout~~ the city, including areas of high land cost where greater subsidies may be needed.

 H43~~2~~ Allow use of public funds to provide subsidized low-income housing units in otherwise market-rate housing developments in order to better integrate low-income households into the community~~, consistent with the City's policies for the geographic distribution of assisted housing~~.

 H44~~3~~ Allocate resources for financial assistance to eligible tenants with incomes ~~below~~up to 50 percent~~%~~ of median income who are displaced from existing low-income housing because of redevelopment, substantial rehabilitation, change- of-use or termination of long-term, low-income rent restrictions in order to help offset the cost of relocating to another unit ~~in a manner~~ consistent with applicable state laws.

 H45~~4~~ Pursue a comprehensive approach of prevention, transition and stabilization services to decrease potential homelessness, stop recurring homelessness and promote long-term self- sufficiency.

 a. Encourage efforts to expand the supply of extremely low-income, permanent housing to meet the needs of those for whom the cost of housing is a chief cause of homelessness.

 b. Strive to develop a continuum of housing opportunities, ranging from emergency shelters to transitional housing to permanent housing, in order to assist homeless households ~~that become homeless to~~ regain and maintain stable, permanent housing.

 c. Strategically invest in emergency and transitional housing for specific homeless populations.

 H46~~5~~In recognition of the fact that for certain people housing support services can mean the difference between housing stability and homelessness, c~~C~~oordinate housing planning and funding, where appropriate, with the following types of housing support services:

 * Services ~~which~~that respond to emergency needs of the homeless (such as emergency shelters).

 * Services ~~which~~that assist clients to secure housing (such as rent and security deposit assistance, housing relocation assistance).

 * Services that help clients to maintain permanent housing (such as landlord/tenant counseling, chore services, in-home health care, outpatient mental health treatment, employment counseling and placement assistance).

~~Seattle recognizes that housing support services are an important component of a comprehensive housing plan, and for certain people these services can mean the difference between housing stability and homelessness or institutionalization.~~

 H47~~6~~ Work in partnership among various levels of government and with other public agencies to address homeless and low- income housing needs that transcend jurisdictional boundaries.

 a. Work with the federal and state governments to increase public support for housing.

 b. Work with the Seattle Housing Authority to address the low-income housing needs of Seattle residents.

 c. Work with other jurisdictions in King County to pursue production of assisted low-income housing throughout the region and an equitable distribution of the cost of providing housing and human services to very-low-income households, including the regional problem of homelessness. Pursue the development of new funding sources, including a regional housing levy or other sources of funding for low-income housing and related supportive services that may be used throughout the region.

 d. Continue providing local resources (such as levies, bond issues and the City's general fund) to meet housing needs, leveraging funds from other sources where appropriate.

 e. Continue to lobby the state government to enact tax incentives~~, such as current use valuation~~ and to increase housing funds to encourage the preservation of existing low-income housing.

 H48~~7~~ Strive to leverage federal, state and private resources with local public funds, where these resources help achieve the goals of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan.

 H49~~8~~ Among its other purposes, the City's Consolidated Plan shall serve as an ongoing, annually updated, coordinated compilation of information for the public regarding housing policies, strategies, programs and resource allocation. Housing portions of the Consolidated Plan constitute a functional plan~~ning~~ to implement housing-related goals and policies in this Comprehensive Plan.

 ATTACHMENT 4 CAPITAL FACILITIES ELEMENT CAPITAL FACILITIES ELEMENT

 A. Capital Facilities Policies

 This section does not apply to transportation or utilities capital facilities. Please see the Transportation or Utilities Elements of this Plan for policies related to those facilities. Various agencies, such as the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation, the Seattle Center and the Seattle Public School District, prepare functional plans to guide development of specific facilities for carrying out their respective missions.

 Goals:

 CFG1 Provide capital facilities that will serve the most pressing needs of the greatest number of Seattle citizens, and that will enable the City to deliver services efficiently to its constituents.

 CFG2 Preserve the physical integrity of the City's valuable capital assets and gradually reduce the major maintenance backlog.

 CFG3 Make capital investments consistent with the vision of the Comprehensive Plan, including the urban village strategy.

 CFG4 Site and design capital facilities so that they will be considered assets to the communities in which they are located.

 CFG5 Provide capital facilities that will keep Seattle attractive to families with children.

 CFG6 Encourage grass-root involvement in identifying desired capital projects for individual neighborhoods.

 CFG7 Encourage community input to the siting of public facilities.

 CFG8 Incorporate sustainability principles and practices including protection of historic resources, into the design,  rehabilitation, and construction of City buildings and other types of capital facilities.

CFG9 Encourage the protection of City-owned historic facilities when planning for alteration or maintenance of these facilities.

 Policies:

 Strategic Capital Investment

 CF1 Plan capital investments strategically, in part by striving to give priority to areas experiencing or expecting the highest levels of residential and employment growth when making discretionary investments for new facilities. The City will use fiscal notes and policy analysis to assist in making informed capital investment choices to achieve the City's long-term goals.

 CF2 Assess policy and fiscal implications of potential major new and expanded capital facilities, as part of the City's process for making capital investment choices. The assessment should apply standard criteria, including the consideration of issues such as a capital project's consistency with the Comprehensive Plan and neighborhood plans, and its effects on Seattle's quality of life, the environment, social equity, and economic opportunity.

 CF3 Emphasize the maintenance of existing facilities as a way to make efficient use of limited financial and physical resources.

 CF4 Use maintenance plans for capital facilities and a funding allocation plan for such maintenance, and revise these plans from time to time. In general, the City should not acquire or construct major new capital facilities unless the appropriation for the maintenance of existing facilities is consistent with the Strategic Capital Agenda.

 CF5 Provide fiscal impact analyses of major capital projects considered for funding. Such analyses should include, but not be limited to, one-time capital costs, life-cycle operating and maintenance costs, revenues from the project, and costs of not doing the project.

 CF6 Make major project specific capital decisions by the Mayor and the Council through the adoption of the City's operating and capital budgets, and the six-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

 CF7 The City will consider capital improvements identified in neighborhood plans, in light of other facility commitments and the availability of funding and will consider voter-approved funding sources.

 CF8 Explore tools that encourage sufficient capital facilities and amenities to meet baseline goals for neighborhoods and to address needs resulting from growth.

 2. Facility Siting

 CF9 Encourage the location of new community-based capital facilities, such as schools, libraries, neighborhood service centers, parks and playgrounds, community centers, clinics and human services facilities, in urban village areas. The City will consider providing capital facilities or amenities in urban villages as an incentive to attract both public and private investments to an area.

 CF10 Seek to locate capital facilities where they are accessible to a majority of their expected users by walking, bicycling, car-pooling, and/or public transit.

 CF11 Consider the recommendations from neighborhood plans in siting new or expanded facilities. The needs of facility users will also be considered in making these decisions.

 CF12 Encourage quality development by requiring major City-funded capital improvement projects or projects proposed on City property located within the City of Seattle to be subject to a design review process of the Seattle Design Commission.

 3. Relations With Other Public Entities Including the Seattle School District, the Port of Seattle, the Regional Transit Authority, Metropolitan King County, and the State of Washington

 CF14 Work with other public and non-profit entities toward coordinated capital investment planning, including coordinated debt financing strategies, to achieve the goals of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan.

 CF15 Work with other public and non-profit entities to include urban village location as a major criterion for selecting sites for new or expanded community-based facilities or public amenities.

 CF16 Work with the School District to encourage siting, renovation, and expansion of school facilities in areas that are best equipped to accommodate growth.

 CF17 Work with other public or non-profit agencies to identify and pursue new co-location and joint-use opportunities for the community's use of public facilities for programs, services, and community meetings.

 4. Regional Funding Policy

 CF18 The City will work with other jurisdictions in King, Snohomish, and Pierce Counties to explore regional funding strategies for capital facilities, particularly for those that serve or benefit citizens throughout the region.

 5. Sustainable Design and Construction

~~CF24~~CF25 Encourage the public and private-sector use of third- party sustainable building rating and certification systems, such as the Master Builder Association's BuiltGreen system and the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system.

 B. Inventory of Existing Public Capital Facilities

 The inventory of public capital facilities is contained in Appendix A to this element of the Plan, and for utilities (including water and drainage and wastewater) and transportation, in the appendices to those elements of the Plan. This inventory is provided both at a citywide level and for each of the Urban Centers.

 C. Forecast of Future Needs for Capital Facilities

 This section does not apply to transportation capital facilities; please see that element of the Plan for pertinent discussion.

 Seattle is a highly urbanized area with a fully developed citywide network of the types of capital facilities necessary to accommodate growth. New households that are projected to locate in Seattle could occupy existing dwellings or new buildings. New buildings can be constructed in Seattle, and be served by the existing network of streets, water and sewer lines, drainage facilities and electrical grid. In addition, new residents can be served by existing and funded police, fire and school facilities. Forecasted future needs for police and fire protection and schools both for the six and twenty- year timeframes are listed in Appendix A to this element of the Plan. Forecasted future needs for water, drainage and wastewater, City Light and solid waste facilities are discussed in Appendix A of the Utilities Element. The capital programs to meet these forecasted six- year needs are included in the City's most recently adopted Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

 The City currently provides a good citywide system of libraries, parks and recreation facilities which are available and accessible for use by all the City's residents. An inventory of these facilities is also contained in Appendix B to this element. While additions to these facilities would enhance the City's quality of life, such additions are not necessary to accommodate new households.

 The City also provides other facilities, such as general government buildings, Seattle Center and Public Health facilities that are of a citywide or regional benefit. While upgrading or replacement of some of these facilities may be funded over the next six years, such improvements are not necessitated by projected growth.

 Source materials for the capital facilities and utilities analysis may be found in documents from the Fire, Police, Seattle City Light, Seattle Public Utilities, Seattle Transportation, Executive Services and Parks and Recreation Departments and the Seattle School District. Facility inventories and capital facility needs for each urban village are shown in the Capital Facilities Appendix.

 D. Proposed New or Expanded Capital Facilities

 Projects or programs identifying the proposed locations and capacities of the new or expanded capital facilities the City contemplates funding in the next six years are listed in the "New or Expanded Capital Facilities" appendix of the City's most recently adopted CIP. Project descriptions and a six-year financing plan for each project or program are in the departmental sections in the body of the CIP. These projects are incorporated herein. Consistent with the overall plan, emergencies, other unanticipated events or opportunities, and voter approvals of ballot measures, may result in some departure from the adopted CIP. Other potential capital improvements that the City may fund over the next six years are found in Appendix D to this element. Additional information for transportation facilities is found in that element.

 E. Six-Year Finance Plan

 Projects or programs, with descriptions of the proposed locations and capacities of the new or expanded capital facilities the City contemplates funding in the next six years, are listed in the "New or Expanded Capital Facilities" appendix of the most recently adopted CIP. These projects and programs are incorporated herein, along with the six-year financing plan for each of them found in the departmental sections of the CIP. These allocations may change over time. Emergencies and unanticipated circumstances may result in allocating resources to projects not listed. This six-year finance plan shows full funding for all improvements to existing facilities and for new or expanded facilities the City expects to need to serve the projected population through the six-year period covered by the CIP. Additionally, the CIP contains funding for major maintenance and for other improvements that will both maintain and enhance the City's existing facilities. Additional information for transportation finance is found in the Transportation element of this Plan.

 F. Consistency and Coordination

 As part of the City's CIP process, the City considers whether probable funding will be sufficient to meet the currently identified needs for new or expanded city capital facilities to accommodate planned growth. Should anticipated funding not materialize, or should new needs be identified for which no funding is determined to be probable, the City will reassess the land use element of this Plan to ensure that it is coordinated, and consistent, with this element, and in particular with the six-year finance plan. A review for coordination and consistency between this Element and the Land Use Element will be part of the City's annual budget review and Comprehensive Plan amendment processes.

 G. Siting Process for Essential Public Facilities

 The Growth Management Act provides that no comprehensive plan or development regulation may preclude the siting of an essential public facility. Accordingly this Plan and the City's Land Use Code permit the establishment of public uses, consistent with applicable development regulations.

 The City will approve a specific list of essential public facilities by type, and facilities on the list will thereafter be subject to the siting process referred to in paragraph three below. (The City's list is currently located in the Land Use Code.) In developing the list the City will consider: state and county lists of essential public facilities; and the extent to which the facility type has historically been difficult to site in the City of Seattle, based upon such factors as the availability of land, access to transportation, compatibility with neighboring uses, and impact upon the physical environment.

 The City's siting process for essential public facilities on the City's specific list should contain the following components:

 a. Interjurisdictional analysis: A review to determine the extent to which an interjurisdictional approach may be appropriate, including a consideration of possible alternative sites for the facility in other jurisdictions and an analysis of the extent to which the proposed facility is of a county-wide, regional or state-wide nature, and whether uniformity among jurisdictions should be considered.

 b. Financial Analysis: A review to determine if the financial impact upon the City of Seattle can be reduced or avoided by intergovernmental agreement.

 c. Special Purpose Districts: When the public facility is being proposed by a special purpose district, the City should consider the facility in the context of the district's overall plan and the extent to which the plan and facility are consistent with this Comprehensive Plan.

 d. Measures to Facilitate Siting: The factors that make a particular facility difficult to site (e.g., see paragraph 2 above) should be considered when a facility is proposed, and measures should be taken to facilitate siting of the facility in light of those factors.

 ATTACHMENT 5 UTILITIES ELEMENT

 A. Introduction

 Discussion:

 Seattle City Light provides electricity throughout the city and beyond the city boundaries. Seattle Public Utilities provides domestic water, drainage and solid waste services within the city limits. In addition, it provides water service directly, or through other purveyors, to much of King County. Seattle is served by, among others, the following investor-owned utilities: Puget Sound Energy, US WEST Communications, and; Viacom Cablevision, TCI Cablevision and Summit Cablevision, and Seattle Steam.

 City utilities are overseen by the Mayor and the City Council. The Council establishes operational guidelines and requirements for City utilities through various resolutions and ordinances. Investor-owned utilities, on the other hand, are regulated by various public entities. The natural gas and telephone utilities are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, while the cellular telephone communication companies are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. Franchise agreements with the City shape the operation of the cable communication companies and Seattle Steam.

 In addition to the policies in this element, additional policies relating to technology and telecommunication services may be found in the Economic Development element of this Plan. Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities prepare functional plans for the energy, water supply, drainage and solid waste activities they control.

 ATTACHMENT 6 Economic Development Element

 Goals

 EDG1 Add approximately 84,000 jobs in the city over the 20-year period covered by this Plan, in order to ensure long-term economic security and social equity to all Seattle residents.

 EDG2 Recognize that Seattle's high quality of life is one of its competitive advantages and promote economic growth that maintains and enhances this quality of life.

 EDG3 Support the Urban Village Strategy by encouraging the growth of jobs in Urban Centers and Hub Urban Villages and by promoting the health of neighborhood commercial districts.

 EDG4 Accommodate a broad mix of jobs, while actively seeking a greater proportion of living wage jobs that will have greater benefits to a broad cross-section of the people of the City and region.

 EDG5 Encourage the growth of key economic sectors that build on Seattle's competitive advantages to provide sustained growth in the future.

 EDG6 Develop a highly trained local work force that effectively competes for meaningful and productive employment, earns a living wage and meets the needs of business.

 EDG7 Foster a positive business climate in Seattle by ensuring adequate public services, infrastructure, and high-quality customer service.

 EDG8 Promote access to working capital and other forms of financial assistance, in order to build a stronger economic future for all Seattle citizens and to nurture entrepreneurship, innovation and business growth.

 EDG9 Maintain Seattle's competitive advantage in international trade.

 EDG10 Recognize Seattle's cultural resources including institutions, art organizations, traditions, historic resources and creative people as important contributors to the city's economic vitality.

 EDG11 Support the retention and growth of the industrial sector, retain existing businesses and small firms, and actively seek to attract new industrial businesses.

 Discussion: A strong Seattle and Puget Sound economy is a critical underpinning of a positive future for Seattle and is a central component of the Urban Village strategy. The Comprehensive Plan promotes a sound economy through planning for future growth in ways that maintain the city's high quality of life by directing facilities and services to areas that support jobs and by identifying and encouraging economic sectors that offer the best opportunities for new job creation and future economic growth. A diverse and stable economy offers long-term economic opportunity and social equity to all Seattle residents.

 City government has limited ability to directly influence the economy, and thus must be strategic in its activities and use of resources. Through a Strategic Action Plan the City will implement the policies of the Comprehensive Plan and will undertake economic development initiatives that build on its competitive economic advantages to enhance its economic base. Realizing the increasingly international nature of the local economy and the pace of technological change, the City will monitor the economy and will periodically alter and refine the goals and policies in this element in response to on-going changes in the economy. In addition to the goals and policies of this element, the Comprehensive Plan contains a number of goals and policies in other elements that complement the Economic Development element.

 A. Economic Development and the Urban Village Strategy

 Discussion: Central to the City's economic development efforts is the urban village strategy. Through the urban village strategy future growth is directed to areas that are supported by strategic investments in facilities and services to support this growth. By focusing growth in urban centers and urban villages this approach leads to greater proximity of jobs to housing and efficient investment in transportation and other infrastructure to support both business and neighborhood needs. Similarly, by directing industrial businesses to manufacturing/industrial centers, the City is able to more efficiently and effectively deliver services and invest in infrastructure that supports these businesses.

 Policies

 ED1 Strive to maintain the economic health and importance of downtown as the economic center of the city and the region and home to many of Seattle's vital professional service firms, high technology companies, regional retail activity, as well as cultural, historic, entertainment, convention and tourist facilities.

 ED2 Pursue opportunities for growth and strategic development, where appropriate, in urban centers and hub urban villages, which are planned for the greatest concentrations of jobs and job growth outside of downtown.

 ED3 Strive to provide a wide range of goods and services to residents and businesses in urban centers and villages by encouraging appropriate retail development in these areas.

 ED4 Use cultural resources, such as public art and historic resources, as a tool for stimulating economic development in Seattle's neighborhoods, as these resources provide attractions that can draw people to and enhance public perception of an area.

 ED5 Use plans adopted for the manufacturing/industrial centers to help guide investments and policy decisions that will continue to support the retention and growth of industrial activities in these areas. Continue collaboration with both geographically-focused and citywide organizations representing industrial interests so that the needs and perspectives of this sector can be recognized and incorporated, as appropriate, into the City's actions and decisions.

 ED6 Work with other levels of government and with the private sector to support and encourage the cleanup of contaminated soil and other environmental remediation associated with the re-use or expansion of industrial sites.

 ED7 Strive, through efforts with other public jurisdictions, to address the problems of site assembly, infrastructure improvements and traffic congestion which may inhibit industrial expansion in industrial areas.

 ED8 Strive to assist industrial firms in addressing capital needs through mechanisms such as the issuance of industrial development bonds or by expanding small business financing programs to assist manufacturers.

 ED9 Strive to address the special needs of areas in Seattle that historically have experienced less economic opportunity and that have high concentrations of people living in economic hardship.

 a. Seek to provide resources to assist in planning for distressed communities and assist low-income areas in developing and implementing economic development strategies.

 b. Attempt to gain state and federal special area designations for lower-income Seattle communities where such designation can confer tangible benefits.

 c. Target programmatic resources, including small business capital access and entrepreneurship training programs, as well as new infrastructure investment toward the economic development objectives of distressed areas.

 d. Support the role of community-based organizations in planning and implementing economic development activities in distressed communities.

 B. Sectoral Strategies

 Discussion: The City's ability to affect the local economy is limited because local economic conditions are the result of national and international economic forces outside the control of the City. Nevertheless, the city possesses competitive advantages and economic resources that can be used to promote a growing local economy. By identifying key sectors of the economy in which the city has a competitive advantage, the City can take specific actions to promote the local economy.

 ED10 Encourage key sectors of Seattle's economy that provide opportunities for long term growth. Criteria for identifying sectors to support include the following:

 * Pay higher-than-average wage levels,

 * Bring new capital into the economy, reflecting multiplier effects other than high wage,

 * Have reasonably good future growth prospects,

 * Involve a cluster of businesses engaging in similar activities,

 * Use quality environmental practices, or

 * Diversify the regional economic base.

 ED11 Recognize the importance of tourism and its support of international trade as well as its contribution to the health of the Seattle retail core. Recognize the important contribution of historic districts such as Pioneer Square and the Pike Place Market to tourism, and support the continued protection and enhancement of these districts.

 ED12 Seek ways to create a local business environment that promotes the establishment, retention, and expansion of high-technology industries in the city. Where possible, look for opportunities to link these businesses to existing research institutions, hospitals, educational institutions and other technology businesses.

 ED13 Seek ways to assist clusters of related businesses in advanced manufacturing, information technology and biotechnology to collaborate more closely with one another and to market themselves as magnets for capital, research talent and high-skill jobs.

 ED14 Seek ways to support technology transfer and other efforts that increase the global competitiveness of Seattle's exporters in advanced manufacturing, information technology, biotechnology and services in cooperation with other jurisdictions and with major education and research institutions.

 ED15 Preserve and support continued use of suitable shoreline areas for water-dependent and related businesses involved in ship-building and repair, fisheries, tug and barge, provisioning and the cruise-ship industries.

 ED16 Support national policies which stabilize maritime industries and promote their expansion.

 C. Labor Force Education, Development and Training

 Discussion: A skilled and competitive work force is important to the city's growth and prosperity. While not having direct control over the education of its citizens, the City has a responsibility to advocate actively on their behalf. The following policies encourage employers, employee organizations and education and training institutions and agencies to provide all Seattle residents opportunities for training and retraining. Certain policies related to education and employability development may be found in Section D of the Human Development Element.

 Policies

 ED17 Work with the Seattle Public Schools to improve the quality of public education and increase the likelihood that all young people will complete high school having achieved the competency needed to continue their education or enter the work force.

 ED18 Facilitate the creation of coalitions of business, labor and educational institutions, including community colleges, to develop competency-based education and training programs for Seattle community members that are targeted to the needs of business. This may include vocational training programs, apprenticeship programs, entrepreneurial skills training, customized on-site training and technical and vocational preparatory programs at the high school level.

 ED19 Support employability development and entry-level and career employment efforts for low-income youth and adults, people of color, women, individuals with disabilities and the homeless.

 ED20 Encourage opportunities for people in training or working to meet their dependent care needs.

 ED21 Promote regional approaches to better link individuals in distressed communities with job resources and living-wage job opportunities in growing employment sectors (See policies related to Sectoral Strategies later in this element.).

 ED22 Encourage the development of training programs for people currently employed so they may improve the skills they use in their current jobs or expand their skills into new arenas.

 ED23 Encourage and facilitate the development of programs for dislocated workers to assist in a successful transition to new jobs.

 ED24 Strive to increase access to literacy development and English- as-a-Second Language programs for those in need of assistance in overcoming literacy and language barriers to employability.

 ED25 Encourage educational and training institutions to provide education in foreign languages, geography and international affairs in order to enable people to better function in the international economy.

 ED26 Offer apprenticeship and other workplace learning opportunities in Seattle City government, with particular emphasis on providing access to low income youth and young adults from diverse cultures and races.

 D. Business Climate

 Discussion: A positive relationship between government, residents, and business is important to the well-being of the city. Business needs cover the range from those of major employers and institutions to small businesses.

 Policies

 ED27 Foster a positive entrepreneurial environment for business start-up and expansion and support the retention of Seattle's existing business and major institution base.

 ED28 Support the development of Seattle's major public and non-profit institutions because they contribute to a diversified economy, bring living wage jobs, stimulate new economic activity, supply capital to the local economy, develop and promote advanced technology, and provide substantial public benefits and needed services to Seattle's residents.

 ED29 Support Seattle's artists, arts organizations, and institutions because of their significant contributions to the city's healthy business climate; their role in creating a cultural environment that attracts other living wage employers, as well as tourists, to the region; and the substantial benefits they provide to Seattle's residents and communities.

 ED30 Recognize the importance of the business climate in efforts to encourage the expansion of international trade in Seattle and the region. Consider support of programs to expand export opportunities for goods and services through the city. Also, consider support of programs to improve and maintain international cooperation. Examples of programs include industry-specific international trade fairs, export trade linkages for home-grown businesses, and Sister Cities programs.

 ED31 Support regulatory reform in order to strike a balance between the financial impacts of regulation on businesses and developers, and maintaining an appropriate level of safeguards for the environment and worker safety, consistent with the goals and policies of this plan.

 ED32 For regulatory activities that affect land development, consider ways to achieve greater predictability and efficiency in the review of permit applications, consistent with the goals and policies of this Plan.

 ED33 Consider use of programmatic environmental impact statements (PEIS) for geographic-specific plans which may help reduce the permit processing time and increase predictability for individual development projects.

 ED34 Recognize the importance of maintaining and enhancing the City's tax base, including property taxes, sales taxes and business and occupation taxes, to provide funds for capital facilities and City services for existing and future populations.

 ED35 Periodically assess the effects of City policies regarding taxes, fees, or utility rates on economic development goals, considering the balance between economic development goals, financial health of City government, cumulative debt and tax burdens of overlapping jurisdictions, and goals of the Comprehensive Plan.

 ED36 Strive to increase communication among government, businesses, major institutions and other entities that may provide economic opportunities, in order to: (a) enhance the common understanding of issues related to employment growth, business competitiveness, public policy goals and program implementation and (b) promote partnerships between government and business to achieve the goals of this plan.

 ED37 Strive to anticipate and lessen the impacts of involuntary job changes through efforts to retain businesses in Seattle and by providing those businesses with the opportunity to thrive.

 ED38 Strive to work with the business community and the residential community equitably to identify and promote areas of common interest and to facilitate the resolution of conflicts in a manner that recognizes and respects legitimate differences.

 ED39 Strive to improve coordination of information and services among government offices which affect the viability of business in Seattle. Seek to better coordinate changes to City policies and programs with other jurisdictions within the region, in order to more effectively participate in the development and implementation of state, regional and county economic development goals.

 ED40 Periodically analyze available economic information to understand the City's economic base and the regional economy in order to review and adjust as needed the City's economic development goals and policies.

 E. Infrastructure and Capital Facilities

 Discussion: An adequate infrastructure is fundamental to Seattle's ability to attract and retain jobs, to enhance business growth and use existing development capacity to achieve job growth targets. The following policies supplement the policies in the capital facilities and transportation elements by addressing ways in which the City's infrastructure plans and capital investment decisions can support its economic development goals. Additional detail may be found in these other Plan elements.

 Policies

 ED41 Seek to coordinate, where appropriate, City investment in utilities, transportation and other public facilities with business, employment and economic development opportunities.

 ED42 Encourage deployment of improvements in technology and the telecommunications system within Seattle with the goals of:

 a. Equitable access for all service providers that use the distribution network in reaching their customers.

 b. Competition that promotes state of the art services and competitive pricing.

 c. Universal access to citizens, businesses and institutions within Seattle.

 d. Effectiveness based on: (i) flexibility, (ii) system security, (iii) reliability and (iv) affordability.

 ED43 vTake into consideration the ability of technology and telecommunications technology to enhance the provision of City services to citizens and businesses when making City investments in communications and computer systems.

 ED44 Encourage the development of technology and telecommunications infrastructure city-wide and region-wide.

 F. Business Start-Up and Growth

 Discussion: The majority of businesses in Seattle have fewer than 10 employees. Sectors with a high proportion of small businesses include construction, wholesale trade, manufacturing, retail and related services. Working capital and other forms of financial assistance are an important component of business start-up and growth.

 Policies

 ED45 Continue to promote close working relationships between Seattle's financial institutions and its business community. Where appropriate, promote the development of new initiatives and innovative programs to lower the cost of borrowing or to assist small business growth, through increased access to capital.

 ED46 Where appropriate, support efforts to assist small business through technical assistance for business start-up and/or expansion.

 ED47 Recognize that artists make a significant contribution to the local economy as small businesses, and support efforts to ensure that Seattle's artist communities may thrive within the city. t

 ATTACHMENT 7 NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING ELEMENT

 Amend Policy N17, as follows:

 N17 Support and encourage the incorporation of cultural elements, such as public art and historic resources, in the implementation of neighborhood plans. In future planning efforts, include a broad range of creative skills to improve the value of the neighborhood projects.

 * * *

 Amend North Rainier Policy NR-P3 as follows:

 NR-P3 Seek to maintain single-family zoned areas within the urban village, but allow rezones to Residential Small Lot to encourage cluster housing developments and bungalow courts. Any single-family zoned area within the urban village is appropriate for any of the Residential Small Lot (RSL) designations, provided that the area meets other requirements of the land use code rezone evaluation criteria for rezones of single-family land. Allow for the rezone of property north of S. Holgate Street that is adjacent to both multifamily and commercially zoned areas to lowrise multifamily zones which permit residential densities that are no higher than permitted in the RSL zone.

 * * *

 Add the following as the adopted neighborhood plan for Northgate:

 NORTHGATE

 GOALS AND POLICIES

 NG-G1 A place where people live, work, shop, plan and go to school--- all within walking distance.

 NG-G2 A thriving, vital, mixed-use center of concentrated development surrounded by healthy single-family neighborhoods transformed from an underutilized, auto-oriented office/retail area.

 LAND USE AND HOUSING

 NG-G3 The surrounding single-family neighborhoods are buffered from intense development in the core, but have ready access to the goods, services, and employment located in the core via a range of transportation alternatives including walking, bicycling, transit, and automobile (the core area is shown on Map G3).

 NG-G4 The most intense and dense development activity is concentrated within the core.

 NG-G5 Commercial activity outside the core is smaller in scale and allows for a mix of uses that serve the adjacent residential neighborhoods.

 NG-P1 Encourage development of the core as a major regional activity center for retail, commercial, office, multifamily residential, and educational uses with densities sufficient to support transit.

 NG-P2 Use land use regulation to cause new development to locate close to transit stops and provide good pedestrian and bicycle connections throughout the area so that intra-area vehicular trips and locally generated traffic are reduced.

 NG-P3 Use a Northgate Overlay District to address the special characteristics of development in the area.

 NG-P4 Concentrate employment activity where the infrastructure and transportation system can best accommodate it.

 NG-P5 Promote a mixture of activities including commercial and residential uses in areas that have Neighborhood Commercial and Residential Commercial zoning designations.

 NG-P6 Promote additional multifamily housing opportunities for households of all income levels to the extent that a compatible scale and intensity of development can be maintained with adjacent single- family areas.

 NG-P7 Reduce conflicts between activities and promote a compatible relationship between different scales of development by maintaining a transition between zones where significantly different intensities of development are allowed.

 NG-P8 Maintain the character and integrity of the existing single- family zoned areas by maintaining current single family-zoning on properties meeting the locational criteria for single-family zones.

 TRANSPORTATION

 NG-G6 An economically viable commercial core with improved alternative means of access, good vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and an enhanced, interesting environment that attracts customers, visitors, and employers.

 NG-G7 Medium to high density residential and employment uses are concentrated within a 10-minute walk of the transit center, reducing the number and length of vehicle trips and making travel by foot and bicycle more attractive.

 NG-P8 Promote the efficiency of the transportation system by accommodating more person trips rather than vehicle trips.

 ATTACHMENT 8 ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT

 Introduction Discussion:

 Environmental stewardship is a core value of this Plan, and it plays an integral role in guiding how the City accommodates growth and provides services. There are many ways the City can protect and improve the environment while acting in its roles as a large employer, builder, land owner and regulator. For example, the City can lead by its own behavior in delivering services, operating its facilities and managing its land in an environmentally sustainable manner.

 When environmental goals compete with other City goals, such as those related to economic development, the City is committed to giving just consideration to the environmental goals to protect the functions that natural systems can perform and to prevent harmful effects on human health. The City will continue to engage the community about ways in which the City can give consideration to the "precautionary principle," which generally provides:

 "Where threats of serious or irreversible harm to people or nature exist, anticipatory action will be taken to prevent damages to human and environmental health, even when full scientific certainty about cause and effect is not available, with the intent of safeguarding the quality of life of current and future generations."

 This element of the Plan contains broad environmental goals and policies. Some of the Plan's other elements include goals and policies addressing how environmental values specifically relate to the topics covered in those elements. For instance, the Land Use Element includes policies governing development near environmentally critical areas such as wetlands and stream corridors, and the Transportation Element addresses possible environmental impacts and improvements associated with transportation choices.

 EG1 Protect and improve the quality and function of the city's air, land, and water resources because of their relationship to human health, wildlife and the region's natural heritage.

 E1 Explore ways for City actions and decisions to have positive effects on the natural environment and human health, and to avoid or offset potential negative effects, including those caused by private projects permitted by the City.

 Relationship to Economic Development

 EG2 Maintain a healthy natural environment as central to Seattle's economic development and as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining family-wage jobs and workers.

 E2 Incorporate the improvement of the natural environment into the City's planning efforts and capital development projects. For instance, plan for transportation systems that control impacts on air quality and climate-change, as well as on water pollution and the consumption of fossil fuels.

 E3 Promote sustainable management of public and private open spaces and landscaping, such as by preserving or planting native and naturalized vegetation, removing invasive plants, engaging the community in long-term maintenance activities, and using integrated pest management.

 E4 Strive to protect and retain certain trees and groups of trees that enhance Seattle's historical, cultural, environmental and aesthetic character.

 E5 Maintain the health of natural habitats on private property through a combination of education, incentives and development standards that recognize and promote sound practices by private land owners.

 E6 Create partnerships with organizations in the private sector and engage the community to protect and enhance Seattle's urban ecosystems and habitat.

 E7 Control the impacts of noise, odor and light, in order to protect human health and the livability of the urban environment.

 Natural Systems Approach

 EG3 Use natural systems to maintain and enhance environmental quality by having them perform such functions as cleaning air and water, and controlling storm water runoff.

 E8 In order to reduce the financial investment in built infrastructure while controlling the environmental impacts that infrastructure can cause, explore opportunities to restore or productively use the functions that a healthy ecosystem can provide in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, built infrastructure.

 E9 Work to achieve a sustainable urban forest that contains a diverse mix of tree species and ages in order to use the forest's abilities to reduce storm water runoff and pollution, absorb air pollutants, provide wildlife habitat, absorb carbon dioxide, provide shade, stabilize soil, and increase property values.

 E10 Strive to increase the amount of permeable surface and vegetative cover in the city in order to mitigate the heat island effect of developed areas, control storm water flows and reduce pollution.

 Aquatic Areas

 EG4 Recognize and enhance the value of Seattle's aquatic areas, including Puget Sound, the lakes, creeks, rivers, and the associated shorelines for their contributions to the quality of life in Seattle.

 EG5 Pursue the long-term health of Seattle's creeks, shorelines and other water bodies by taking actions that address flooding, water quality, habitat and barriers to fish passage.

 EG6 Strive to minimize the number and extent of combined sewer overflow events occurring annually in the City.

 E11 Identify long-term goals and develop plans or strategies for improving the environmental quality of each of the city's aquatic areas, including a long-term plan to restore and sustain Seattle's creeks. Consider in these plans or strategies the use of incentives, regulations and other opportunities for action to restore and sustain the long-term health of Seattle's creeks and shorelines.

 E12 Take steps to improve water quality and the health of the city's aquatic areas, such as by eliminating the use of chemicals that have negative impacts on aquatic or human health, especially on City- owned property or rights-of-way.

 E13 Strive to achieve flows in creeks that will support a variety of aquatic life and that will control flooding and property damage caused by unregulated flows.

 E14 Promote both public and private opportunities to improve water quality and help restore aquatic habitat in the city's creeks, lakes, rivers and marine waters and their shorelines, so that these habitats are healthy for native wildlife and people.

 Climate Change

 EG7 Reduce the emission of greenhouse gases to control the impact of climate change globally and locally.

 E15 Work with private and public sector partners to reduce climate- changing greenhouse gas emissions from private and public sources to control the impacts of global warming on the city's water supply, electrical energy supply, ecosystems, public health and economy.

 City Operations

 EG8 Strive to continuously improve the City's environmental performance in its roles as a large employer, builder and maintainer of capital facilities, land owner and regulator to not only improve the natural environment but also to set an example for others' behavior.

 E16 In the operations of City government, strive to reduce the use of resources and toxics, prevent pollution, reuse existing resources such as historic structures, control waste, and protect natural areas and biodiversity.

 E17 To improve the City's environmental performance, set targets, use innovative approaches, encourage employees, and coordinate with other government entities.

 E18 In order to assess the City's success in moving toward a sustainable urban environment, the City should identify and establish goals for key indicators of such factors as human health, the economy, population, energy use, sprawl, natural systems and pollution. Collect data and regularly report on these indicators to inform and enable citizens and decision-makers to consider alternative policies or programs, where outcomes differ from what was intended by this Plan. Consider combining this monitoring activity with the one described in the Urban Village Element of this Plan.

 Source Control

 EG9 Make waste reduction, pollution prevention and recycling integral parts of how City government and others in the city conduct their daily business.

 E19 Reduce consumption of resources and promote conservation of energy, water and material resources among all sectors of the community, including City government.

 E20 Consider long-term environmental costs, in City planning, purchasing and operating decisions. For instance, look at all of the environmental impacts caused by materials from their production to disposal. t

 ATTACHMENT 9b LAND USE APPENDICES

 Land Use Appendix A: SUMMARY OF EXISTING LAND USE, POPULATION, AND EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS

 This section describes the existing arrangement and concentration of uses and activities such as housing, businesses, parks, and industries.

 Land Uses

 Seattle encompasses approximately 53,500 acres or about 84 square miles. Land Use Figure A-1 illustrates how the city's land area is distributed among different types of uses. About 40 percent of the city is occupied by residential uses, primarily in single-family development. Street rights-of-way take up the next largest amount of land - over 26 percent. Commercial and industrial areas, where most of the jobs in the city are located, occupy about 9 percent, while parks and other open spaces account for over 10 percent.

 Land Use Figure A-2 depicts how these various activities are distributed within the city.

[Land Use Figure A-2 - Generalized Existing Land Use](/~ordpics/115137At9bLUFigA2.gif)

 With the exception of Downtown Seattle, the Ballard-Interbay and Duwamish industrial areas and their surrounding neighborhoods, Seattle is predominantly covered by single-family houses and street right-of- way. Most multifamily residences are concentrated in core areas such as First Hill/Capitol Hill and the University District. Jobs are located primarily in commercial and industrial areas such as Downtown, Duwamish, First Hill, Northgate and the University District.

 Residential Uses

 Housing Types

 Slightly more than half of the city's households are living in single- family houses, according to the 2000 United States Census (Land Use Figure A-3). Most of these dwellings are located in areas devoted exclusively to low-density development. The Census figure includes both detached single-family housing units, and the 2 percent of Seattle's housing that is in attached buildings, such as townhouses, and consequently over-counts the number of units Seattle would classify as single-family. Detached single-family homes occupy 35 percent of the city's total land area.

 Slightly less than half of the city's households live in some type of multifamily or mixed-use development concentrated on 10 percent of the city's land area. These multifamily dwellings are in buildings of varying sizes, including small buildings of two to four units (duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes), medium-sized buildings (apartment buildings and condominiums with 5 to 19 units), and large buildings (apartment buildings and condominiums with 20 units or more). Citywide, small multifamily buildings of two to four units account for 8 percent of Seattle's housing, medium-sized buildings account for 16 percent of the city's units, and 24 percent of Seattle's dwelling units are in large buildings.

[Land Use Figure A-5 - 2000 Population Density](/~ordpics/115137At9bLUFigA5.gif)

 Housing and Population Density

 Land Use Figure A-4 shows the distribution of household density in the city expressed as the number of households per gross acre. (Gross acre includes nonresidential uses such as street rights-of-way and parks.) Areas with the highest density of households (hh) are located north of the I-90 freeway. Portions of First Hill/Capitol Hill contain the highest density of households - in some areas well over 40 hh/gross acre. Other areas with high-density residential neighborhoods include Uptown and Belltown. The next densest areas include the Chinatown/International District, the University Community, Fremont, Ballard, and Eastlake. Areas of more moderate housing unit density (8-10 hh per gross acre) include Aurora-Licton Springs, Green Lake, the Central District, Beacon Hill, and the West Seattle Junction. A population density map (Land Use Figure A-5) is another way of presenting information about where people live. This figure shows a concentration of residents similar to that of the household density map. In addition, it shows isolated areas where significant concentrations of people occur, such as the Highpoint and Sandpoint communities.

 Seattle is a regional employment center providing a wide variety of jobs. Based on data from the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) and the King County Assessor's office, in 2002 Seattle contained about 502,500 jobs in businesses occupying about 4,900 commercial and industrial acres, or 9 percent of the total city land area. Land Use Figure A-6 shows the distribution of these jobs according to standard classifications by district.

 The change over the last 20 years in the number of jobs in each employment sector is shown in Land Use Figure A-7. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of jobs in Seattle increased by almost 40 percent, (153,735 new jobs). Service jobs accounted for the biggest increases, while manufacturing jobs have decreased by more than 20 percent over 20 years.

 Land Use Figure A-8 illustrates the distribution of employment density as number of jobs per gross acre. Areas with the highest job densities (greater than 50 jobs/gross acre) include Downtown, First Hill, the University of Washington, South Lake Union, and Uptown communities. Areas with moderately high employment densities (26 to 50 jobs/gross acre) are the University District, Eastlake, Fremont and Queen Anne areas. Predominantly residential areas of the city have employment densities as low as 1 to 15 jobs per acre.

[Land Use Figure A-8 - 2000 Employment Density by Census Tract](/~ordpics/115137At9bLUFigA8.gif)

 Major Employment Concentrations

 Employment activity is much more concentrated than housing. Most of the jobs in the city are located in the areas described below. These areas are unique because they attract people daily from all over the city and region.

 Downtown. Downtown Seattle, with over 165,000 jobs at an average density of about 175 jobs per gross acre, supports the largest concentration of jobs in the Pacific Northwest. In the Commercial Core, job densities average 400 jobs per acre. Just over one-third of all jobs in the city are located downtown.

 First Hill/Capitol Hill. A specialized concentration of medical facilities has developed on First Hill east of downtown, lending the area the nickname "Pill Hill." With Swedish Hospital Medical Center, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center and related support facilities, this area has one of the greatest employment concentrations in the city, with over 21,000 jobs at an average employment density of about 96 jobs per acre. Capitol

 Hill, Pike/Pine, and 12th Avenue to the north and east of First Hill, are home to colleges and universities, as well as thriving retail districts. Combined, these other portions of the First Hill/Capitol Hill Urban Center contain another 16,000 jobs, at an average 24 jobs per acre.

 University Community. The University Community, with over 34,000 jobs contains a large amount of employment associated with both the University of Washington, the largest single employer in the city, and service and retail businesses, such as Safeco Insurance and University Village. Employment density in the University District is about 45 jobs per acre.

 Northgate. In addition to Northgate Mall, the city's principal regional shopping facility outside of downtown, several major employers are clustered in the Northgate area, including Northwest Hospital, North Seattle Community College, and a relatively large concentration of service jobs. This area has a total employment of about 11,500 jobs, at a density of about 28 jobs per acre.

 Uptown. Another substantial concentration of employment located immediately north of downtown is the area around Seattle Center between Denny Way and the base of Queen Anne Hill. Providing backup office and service activity for downtown, as well as other retail and service uses, the area accommodates over 16,000 jobs at a job density of approximately 55 jobs per acre.

 South Lake Union. The area that has seen the fastest employment growth over the last ten years is South Lake Union, between Denny Way and Lake Union, just north of Downtown. A growing home to a number of services industries, South Lake Union has historically provided a location for manufacturing and wholesale businesses. South Lake Union contains approximately 21,000 jobs at a density of 62 jobs per acre.

 Major Institutions. A number of major institutions located throughout the city also provide significant concentrations of employment for the whole region, such as the University of Washington. Others are smaller concentrations of employment in otherwise low-density areas, such as the Veterans Administration Medical Center and Seattle Pacific University.

 Neighborhood Commercial. Seattle's neighborhood business areas provide locations for services needed by the surrounding low- to moderate-residential populations, such as food from restaurants or grocery stores; entertainment; professional, personal or business services. These neighborhood businesses are dispersed and the range of services they provide varies throughout the city. They generally are in locations with fair accessibility to both the transportation network and concentrations of people.

 A number of the city's larger, more-established neighborhood commercial areas also provide concentrations of employment. Ballard, Fremont and West Seattle Junction are all areas with between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs and employment densities averaging in the 10 to 20 jobs per acre range. Other commercial areas with notable job concentrations include Lake City, the Aurora strip between N. 115th and N.145th streets, and the area around Rainier Avenue and Interstate 90. The employment populations of these areas range between 3,000 and 4,000, with average job densities of between 8 and 12 jobs per acre.

 Industrial Areas. Citywide, industrial uses are concentrated in the Duwamish Valley, and BINMIC (the Ballard-Interbay-Northend Manufacturing/Industrial Center), which includes Interbay, and the shoreline area between Ballard and Fremont. Some manufacturing and industrial activity also occurs around the shores of Lake Union and along Rainier Avenue S., near Interstate 90. Two of these areas, BINMIC and the Duwamish, are major areas of employment. BINMIC has roughly 15,000 jobs, while the Duwamish accounts for over 65,000. Combined, they contain roughly 17 percent of the city's total employment population. Given the land-intensive nature of employment activities in these areas, the job densities are comparatively low, seldom exceeding 15 jobs per acre. t

 Transportation Appendix A Inventory of Existing Facilities and Services

 Limited Access Facilities, Arterials and Streets

 There are approximately 54,000 acres of land in the city, nearly 14,000 of which (about 26 percent) are used for street rights-of-way. Seattle's street network in 2004 consists of 1,534 miles of arterials, including some that are designated state routes, and 2,412 miles of non-arterials (see Transportation Figure A-1). In the arterial system there are 620 miles of principal arterials, 566 miles of minor arterials, and 348 miles of collector arterials. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes exist on some arterials and limited access facilities as shown in Transportation Figure A-3. There are 975 signalized intersections, 4,596 non-signalized arterial intersections and 7,029 non-arterial intersections. Transportation Figures A-2a-c show the locations of traffic and pedestrian crossing signals in Seattle. The "state signals" are managed by the Washington State Department of Transportation and are located mostly at freeway on- and off-ramps.

 Traffic Volumes

 Transportation Figure A-4 shows the 2002 average weekday traffic volumes on Seattle's arterials and freeways. To analyze trends, traffic counts are taken annually on arterials and freeways along screenlines at or near the city limits, and are added together to estimate the traffic volume entering and exiting the city daily. Transportation Figure A-5 shows the trend in average weekday traffic at the city limit screenlines; the volume has increased from 758,000 in 1980 to 1,190,800 in 2003 -- a 64 percent increase over 23 years. During the same period, Seattle's population increased by 9.3 percent. However, between 1995 and 2002 approximately 51,000 new jobs were added within the city, a 12% increase.

 Transportation Figure A-6 similarly shows the trend in average weekday traffic crossing an imaginary cordon around downtown Seattle, bounded by Lenora Street, I-5, Royal Brougham Way, and Alaskan Way. The volumes include traffic getting on and off the ferries. From 1980 to 2003, downtown cordon traffic grew 22 percent, from 371,000 to 475,980.

 Transit

 Public transit in Seattle is provided by three agencies. Metro provides bus, trolley and streetcar services that cover most of King County. Community Transit and Sound Transit operate express bus services to Seattle from King, Snohomish and Pierce Counties. As of 2002, Metro serves a population of nearly 2 million over a 2,128- square-mile service area. It operates approximately 1300 vehicles on about 188 routes representing 7,050 route miles with annual ridership of over 75 million. Transportation Figure A-7 shows Metro's 2004 transit routes in Seattle.

 Metro currently operates a 1.3-mile-long tunnel under Third Avenue and Pine Street from the International District to 9th Avenue and Pine Street. The tunnel has five stations, and connects to Interstate 90 at the south end and to the Interstate 5 express lanes at the north end. Dual-powered buses operate through the tunnel; diesel power is used on streets and highways, while electric power is used in the tunnel. In addition to dual powered buses, the tunnel will be used as part of Sound Transits Link light rail line through downtown. Renovation of the tunnel for use by both buses and trains is scheduled for completion by 2009.

 Metro has about 56 miles of two-way overhead electric trolley wire in Seattle used by approximately 146 trolley buses. Trolleys produce no tailpipe emissions and are considerably quieter than diesel buses.

 All buses operating in downtown Seattle are free to riders from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. The ride-free zone boundaries are Battery Street, Sixth Avenue, I-5, Jackson Street, and the waterfront. The ride-free zone significantly reduces the need to use cars for short trips around downtown. The Waterfront Streetcar system includes three streetcars, nine stations, and more than two miles of rail. The tracks and overhead wire run along Alaskan Way and South Main Street from Myrtle Edwards Park to the International District.

 Sound Transit is the regional transit authority for the Puget Sound area (which includes portions of King, Snohomish and Pierce Counties.) Sound Transit was created in 1996 by voters within its boundary, and is implementing the first phase of its "Sound Move" regional transit plan. The Sound Move plan includes: operation of a 14-mile light rail system (called "Link") between SeaTac and downtown Seattle, with possible extension to Northgate; peak period commuter rail services (called "Sounder") along existing rail lines between downtown Seattle, Tacoma and Everett; and regional bus services.

 As of 2004, Sound Transit provides regional express bus services between suburban areas within its three-county service area, downtown Seattle, West Seattle, and the University District. Sounder commuter rail provides rail service between Tacoma and Seattle and between Everett and Seattle. Besides the King Street Station, where the Tacoma and Everett services reach downtown Seattle, there are two provisional Sounder stations identified in Seattle in the Georgetown and Ballard communities.

 By 2009 there will be at least 11 Link light rail stations in Seattle: in the Rainier Valley at Henderson Street (Rainier Beach area), Othello Street (Holly Park area), Edmunds Street (Columbia City area), and McClellan Street (Mount Baker area); Beacon Avenue and Lander Street (Beacon Hill area), and through downtown using the existing downtown tunnel stations. Stations planned but deferred for future operation include Graham Street, and Royal Brougham. Currently, planning for extension of Link north of downtown to Northgate is under study. In 2004, Sound Transit identified a preferred route for North Link. The preferred North Link route will stretch north of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel with stations at Madison Street (First Hill area), Nagle Place (Capitol Hill area), Husky Stadium and Brooklyn at NE 43rd Street (University District), NE 65th Street (Roosevelt Neighborhood) and Northgate. It is anticipated that by 2030 this line will have a daily ridership in excess of 150,000 passengers.

 In 2002, Seattle Voters approved a measure to fund construction of a monorail linking Ballard, Downtown, and West Seattle. Construction of the 14-mile line is scheduled to begin in 2005 with partial opening planned for 2007 and full operation in 2009. Planning for the 2nd of potentially 5 lines by the Seattle Monorail Project began in 2003. Currently, the City of Seattle operates a monorail on a mile of elevated guideway between Westlake Mall in downtown Seattle and the Seattle Center. The monorail carried about 2.1 million riders in 2003. The Seattle Monorail will close in the fall of 2005 to make way for construction of the Seattle Monorail Projects' Green Line.

 Metro and WSDOT operate 15 park-and-ride lots in Seattle with approximately 2,280 parking spaces, as shown in Transportation Figures A-9 and A-10. There is also a Metro transit center just south of the Northgate Mall. The park-and-ride lots may be used by commuters, free of charge, to meet a carpool, vanpool or bus. Metro provides wheelchair-accessible buses and other special transportation services for persons unable to use regular bus service. For example, low-income King County residents 65 years or older and people with disabilities are eligible for reduced-cost taxi trips. Other Metro programs and services include custom buses, special event service, the U-Pass program with the University of Washington, bikes on buses, vanpools, and a ridematch service.

 Bicycles and Pedestrians

 Bicycles are classified as "vehicles" in the Seattle Traffic Code and have the right to use all streets in the city except where explicitly prohibited. Transportation Figure A-11 shows the three categories of bike facilities, and the miles of each. Bicycle racks are provided in neighborhood commercial areas and downtown, and some work places provide secure, weather-protected bike parking, showers, and lockers. As of 2000, the City has installed over 1900 bike racks across the city. Seattle's Land Use Code requires that many new developments include bike parking where parking is built for cars.

 Metro first installed bike racks on buses in 1979 to carry bicyclists across the SR-520 Bridge. Metro has since installed bike racks on their entire fleet of buses. Metro also has bike racks and lockers at some of its Seattle park-and-ride lots and at the Northgate Transit Center. The Washington State Ferry Colman Dock in downtown Seattle has bicycle racks for 10 to 15 bikes, while the Fauntleroy dock has none. All ferries provide simple tie-downs for bicycle transport, although the passenger-only ferries can carry only five bikes.

 Of the City's 479 miles of arterials (in 1995), about 306 miles had sidewalks or asphalt walkways on both sides of the street, and 140 miles had a sidewalk or walkway on one side of the street; about 33 miles of arterials do not have sidewalks or asphalt walkways on either side of the street. "School walk boundaries" define areas where school bus service is not provided and students generally walk to school. In 1995, there were 20 miles of arterials in elementary school walk boundaries without sidewalks on either side of the street; and there were 362 miles of Seattle residential streets (non- arterials) lacking sidewalks within the school walk boundaries.

 Parking

 On-street parking occurs in the public right-of-way and is therefore regulated by the City through the creation of no-parking and special- use parking zones, time-of-day restrictions, parking duration limits, pay stations/meters, and residential parking zones. In 2004, the City started converting most single-space parking meters to parking pay station kiosks. All pay stations will be installed at the rate of $1.50 per hour. As electric meters are reprogrammed, the parking meter rate will increase to $1.50 per hour. Because existing mechanical meters cannot be reprogrammed, they will remain at $1.00 or 0.60 cents per hour and will be phased out as pay stations are installed.

 Residential parking zones (RPZ's) are designed to protect Seattle's residential neighborhoods from parking impacts and congestion from major employment and/or retail centers. In an RPZ, on-street parking is generally restricted to one or two hours, except for residents and guests who display special RPZ decals. Existing RPZ's are in the following communities: Montlake, Squire Park, West Seattle-Fauntleroy, Capitol Hill, Wallingford, University District, First Hill, Eastlake, Magnolia, North Queen Anne, North Capitol Hill, Uptown (Seattle Center), Central District (Garfield High School), Belmont/Harvard, Mount Baker (Franklin high school), North Beacon Hill, Licton Springs (North Seattle Community College), Cowen Park/Roosevelt, Ravenna Bryant

 Off-street parking facilities are usually privately-owned and operated. The City regulates the location and size of garages and lots through the Land Use Code and facilities with paid parking pay a licensing fee. Transportation Figure A-12 shows inventory data for off-street parking in three Seattle areas: the Central Business District, Uptown/South Lake Union, First Hill and the University District.

 Carpools receive preferential parking treatment through City programs, allocation of on-street parking spaces, and Land Use Code requirements for carpool parking in new developments.

 Rail

 Passenger Rail: Amtrak operates trains over 900 miles of Burlington Northern tracks in the state and provides service to 16 cities. The Empire Builder provides daily service from Seattle to Spokane and on to Chicago; the Cascades operates twice a day to/from Portland, and daily to/from Vancouver, B.C. The Coast Starlight runs daily connecting Seattle to Portland, Oakland and on to Los Angeles

 Freight: Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) owns and operates a mainline dual-track from Portland to Seattle. Union Pacific owns and operates a single mainline track with two-way train operations between Tacoma and Seattle. BNSF owns and operates tracks that extend north from downtown Seattle to Snohomish County and then east to Spokane. A connecting spur, operated by the Ballard Terminal Rail Company, serves the Ballard and the western ship canal area. BNSF trains range up to 5,500 feet in length; Union Pacific trains are up to 7,700 feet long.

 Rail-line capacity depends on train length, operating speeds, the number of switch crossover points, and whether the line has one- or two-way traffic. Current train speed limits in the City are 10, 20, or 40 mph depending on the segment.

 There are three truck-to-train intermodal terminals serving the Duwamish Industrial area: Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the Seattle International Gateway yard north of S. Hanford Street, Union Pacific operates the Seattle Yard north of the Georgetown neighborhood, and the Port of Seattle operates an intermodal facility at Terminal 18. North of downtown Seattle is BNSF's Interbay rail yard.

 Air Transportation

 There are three commercial aircraft landing facilities in the greater Seattle metropolitan area: Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea- Tac), operated by the Port of Seattle and located in the City of SeaTac; the Lake Union seaplane base in Seattle; and the Lake Washington seaplane base near Kenmore. Sea-Tac's facilities include two instrument runways, 76 loading gates, one main and two satellite terminals, and 4.5 miles of intra-airport roads. Sea-Tac accommodates over 38 airlines, including 13 international passenger carriers and 18 all-cargo carriers. In 2003 there were 354,770 aircraft operations at Sea-Tac.

 The majority of general aviation flights take off and land either at King County International Airport (Boeing Field) or at one of the 11 active privately-operated helistops and heliports around the city. Boeing Field has one 10,000-foot runway with an instrument landing system and one 3,700-foot runway. The number of flight operations at Boeing Field was 363,838 in 2000.

 Water Transportation

 The Washington State Ferry (WSF) system operates two terminals in Seattle -- Colman Dock in downtown Seattle, and the Fauntleroy terminal in West Seattle. Passenger-and-vehicle service is provided on two ferry routes from Colman Dock -- to Bainbridge Island and to Bremerton. Passenger-and-vehicle ferries link Fauntleroy with Vashon Island and Southworth.

 The Victoria Clipper operates between one to four round trips daily, depending on the season, between Seattle and Victoria on passenger- only catamarans.

 Other Intermodal Facilities

 The Port of Seattle operates and supports marine, rail, and air intermodal facilities. Port of Seattle facilities include 25 commercial marine terminals, 3 container terminals with 23 container cranes, a warehouse complex and distribution center, and a deep-draft grain terminal. Services are offered by about 100 steamship operators and agents; about 30 tug and barge operators; about 100 truck and warehouse operators; and Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific railroads, operating intermodal yards. Transportation Figure A-13 shows the Port of Seattle facilities located in Seattle.

 Transportation Appendix B

 Land Use Assumptions Used in Estimating Travel

 To estimate future travel levels, assumptions were made for a variety of factors related to future population, employment, and transportation facilities. These include the number and geographic distribution of both households and employment in Seattle and the region, characteristics of households and jobs (e.g., number of residents per household, household income), and the transportation network (e.g., streets, transit routes). Then, a computer model was used to predict the total number of person-trips between various zones, the number of trips that would use various modes (e.g., car, bus, bike, walk), and the resulting vehicle traffic volumes on various streets throughout the city.

 Existing Conditions

 In 2000, the census counted 563,374 people living in Seattle; 2004 state estimates place the number at about 572,600. But Seattle's daytime population is much larger than the number of people who live in the city. A conservative 2000 estimate that takes employment into account but does not consider other reasons people come to, or leave, Seattle during the daytime-such as attending college classes, shopping, business travel, entertainment, tourism, and medical care-- would number at least 717,465 in 2000. This estimate is based on the following data from the 2000 census:

 * 563,374 people lived in Seattle in 2000

 * 59,000 Seattle residents worked outside the city

 * approximately 220,000 people commuted to Seattle from other places for work

 Seattle covers about 54,000 acres of land. Most areas of the city are of predominantly one type of land use (e.g., residential, commercial, or industrial). About 40 percent of the city's land area is occupied by residential uses. In 1990, there were a total of about 249,000 housing units in the city. Estimates in 2003 place the total number of housing units in the city at about 269,069. The area north of the ship canal has more of its land area occupied by housing than mid- Seattle (south of the ship canal to I-90) or south Seattle (south of I-90).

 Street rights-of-way take up the next largest amount of land, almost 26 percent. Commercial and industrial areas, where most of the jobs in the city are located, occupy about 13 percent of the land area. Parks occupy nine percent; cemeteries, reservoirs, and other uses occupy six percent; and six percent of the land is vacant.

 Regional Land Use Assumptions

 The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) conducts regional planning for the four-county (Snohomish, King, Pierce, and Kitsap) central Puget Sound region. The PSRC's Vision 2020 Growth Strategy and Transportation Plan presents a vision and array of strategies designed to achieve goals of growth management, transportation demand management, and improved transportation investment decisions. The PSRC provides population and employment forecasts for the region, focusing future population and employment growth into urban centers.

 Seattle Land Use Assumptions

 Within Seattle, the upper limits of the growth targets in the adopted Plan for population, households, and employment were used to estimate future travel. These targets call for an additional 47,000 households and 67,200 jobs over the 20-year life of this plan. This growth was allocated within the city as follows:

 Household Growth Employment Growth

 Urban centers 28,300 (60%) 67,200 (80%)

 Hub urban villages 4,800 (10%) 4,200 (5%)

 Residential villages 7,000 (15%) 4,200 (5%)

 Areas outside centers and 7,000 (15%) villages

 Manufacturing/industrial centers -- 8,400 (10%)

 TOTAL 47,000 (100%) 84,000 (100%)

 Transportation Appendix C Traffic Forecasts

 Region-wide and city-limit traffic volume forecasts for the Comprehensive Plan are as follows:

 Total vehicle-miles-of-travel (VMT) for the region (per day): 1998 estimate: 76 million 2020 forecasts: 106 million ( + 39% )

 Traffic volume at north city limit (vehicles per day): 1998 estimate: 361,000 2020 forecasts: 413,000 ( + 14% )

 Traffic volume at south city limit (vehicles per day): 1998 estimate: 482,000 2010 forecasts: 546,000 ( + 13% )

 Traffic volume at east city limit (SR 520 and I-90) (vehicles per day): 1998 estimate: 259,300 2020 forecasts: 284,000 ( + 10% )

 Regional transit trips as a percent of total motorized trips: 1998 estimate: 3 percent 2020 forecast: 6 percent

 To analyze the transportation effects of the Comprehensive Plan goals and policies on the City's arterial streets in urban centers and in urban village areas, traffic conditions were analyzed for a system of 42 screenlines, shown in Transportation Figure A-13. These screenlines functionally cover the entire City, including urban centers and areas identified for future designation as urban villages. The Comprehensive Plan's level-of-service (LOS) system uses a similar screenline system, with 30 of the same screenlines. Twelve screenlines were added for this traffic forecast analysis to supplement the data in urban centers.

 Traffic volumes were forecasted for arterial streets for the year 2020. These forecasted volumes were totaled for all arterials crossing a particular screenline, and this screenline volume was compared to the sum of the "planning capacities" for the arterials crossing the screenline, yielding a ratio of volume-to-capacity (v/c) for each direction of traffic for each screenline.

 The screenline methodology was used both for the Comprehensive Plan's level-of-service system to judge the performance of the arterial system, and for the traffic forecast analysis described in this Appendix. This system was selected because it steps back from the micro-level focus of traditional intersection LOS analysis, and recognizes explicitly the broader geographic impacts of development and travel patterns. The system recognizes that no single intersection or arterial operates in isolation. Motorists have choices, and they select particular routes based on a wide variety of factors. If traffic congestion on one arterial increases, it may not make sense to expand the capacity of that arterial. The City, instead, may want to shift traffic to a nearby under-used arterial, or to expand capacity on a different nearby arterial, or to implement measures to reduce travel demand -- or a combination of these strategies. Accordingly, this analytic methodology focuses on a "traffic-shed," an area where arterials among which drivers logically can choose are organized for functional analysis.

 Transportation Figure A-14 lists, for each screenline, the forecasted year 2020. (This Figure supplements the more limited information provided in Transportation Figure 3 in Section E. of the Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element.1)

 As can be seen in Transportation Figure A-14, the forecasted screenline v/c ratios for the year 2020 under the Comprehensive Plan range from 0.32 to 1.2. With one exception, each screenline that serves as a level-of-service (LOS) screenline, the forecasted year 2020 v/c ratio is below the LOS standard established for that screenline. By analyzing the forecasted year 2020 v/c ratios at screenlines in or near urban centers, one can evaluate the effects of the Comprehensive Plan goals and policies on the transportation systems in the urban centers.

 Downtown: Screenlines 10.11, 12.12, A1, A2, and A3 pass through or along the edge of the Downtown Urban Center, some encompassing north- south avenues, and some encompassing east-west streets. For all five of these screenlines, the year 2020 v/c ratios under the Comprehensive Plan are below 1.0. This means that for screenlines 10.11 and 12.12, the year 2020 v/c ratios are also below the established LOS standards of 1.0 for screenline 10.11 and 1.2 for screenline 12.12.

 Seattle Center: For the Seattle Center Urban Center, screenline A4 is an east-west screenline while screenline A5 is drawn north-south through the Urban Center. For both of these screenlines, the year 2020 v/c ratios are well below 1.0.

 First Hill/Capitol Hill: Screenlines A6, A7, and A8 are drawn through the First Hill/ Capitol Hill Urban Center. Screenline 12.12, on the east edge of the Downtown Urban Center, is on the west edge of the First Hill/Capitol Hill Urban Center. For all four of these screenlines, the year 2020 v/c ratios under the Comprehensive Plan are well below 1.0.

 University District: For the University District Urban Center, screenlines 5.16 and 13.13 cover the south and west boundaries of the Urban Center, while screenline A9 passes east-west through the Center and screenline A10 is drawn north-south through the Center. The year 2020 v/c ratios under the comprehensive Plan for all four of these screenlines are below 1.0. The forecasted year 2020 v/c ratios for screenline 5.16 are nearly 1.0, compared to the LOS standard of 1.2. These high v/c ratios reflect traffic congestion around the University District, much of which is due to through traffic.

 Northgate: For the Northgate Urban Center, screenline A11 is drawn east-west through the Center, while screenline A12 passes north-south through the Center. The year 2020 v/c ratios for both of these screenlines are well below 1.0.

 South Lake Union: For the South Lake Union Urban Center, Screenline 8 is drawn is drawn in a north-south, south of Lake Union. The year 2020 v/c ratio for this screenline is below 1.2 LOS standard.

 The Comprehensive Plan includes policies to improve transit service and related transit capital facilities, as well as to improve non- motorized transportation facilities, to afford ways for people to avoid the traffic congestion inherent in dense urban centers and urban village areas. In this way, people may avoid the congestion reflected in higher v/c ratios across some screenlines.

 As this analysis of transportation impacts demonstrates, the forecasted year 2020 screenline volume-to-capacity ratios under the Comprehensive Plan do not exceed the established LOS standards for any screenlines. With the exception of Screenline 5.16 for the Ballard Bridge, the forecasted year 2020 v/c ratios are within acceptable ranges. The 2020 v/c ratio forecast for Screenline 5.16 is 1.2 and the standard for that screen line is also 1.2. As provided in Comprehensive Plan Policy T69, when the calculated v/c ratio for a screenline approaches the LOS standard for that screenline, the City will pursue strategies to reduce vehicular travel demand across the screenline and/or increase the operating capacity across the screenline.

 Transportation Appendix D

 Intergovernmental Coordination Efforts

 This section describes the City's intergovernmental coordination efforts during the development of the Comprehensive Plan, and potential impacts of the plan on the transportation systems of adjacent jurisdictions.

 Puget Sound Regional Council

 Seattle is an active member of the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), which is charged with certifying that local transportation plans are consistent with regional plans and goals. The City supports PSRC's Vision 2020, a transportation/land use plan that describes linking high-density residential and employment centers throughout the region by high capacity transit and promoting a multi-modal transportation system. Vision 2020's goals are carried forward by this Comprehensive Plan.

 The PSRC provides population, employment, and transportation data to Seattle and other jurisdictions -- coordination is established via this centralized information resource.

 In addition, the PSRC is charged with allocating certain federal funds. Seattle has participated in establishing the criteria and selection process to determine how funds will be distributed among transportation projects.

 Impacts on Adjacent Jurisdictions

 Four jurisdictions are adjacent to the City of Seattle: the City of Shoreline, King County, and the City of Lake Forest Park along Seattle's north boundary, and the City of Tukwila and King County along Seattle's south boundary. In consultation with adjacent jurisdictions, several major arterials that lie within these jurisdictions near the Seattle border were selected for analysis. For each arterial, the existing p.m. peak hour traffic volume and forecasted year 2020 traffic volume were compared to the "planning capacity" of the arterial, yielding a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio. The results of this analysis are shown in Transportation Figure A-15.

 For all but two of the arterials shown in Transportation Figure A-16, the p.m. peak hour v/c ratio is below 1.0, indicating that there is remaining traffic capacity currently and forecasted for the future. The exceptions are Bothell Way N.E. just north of N.E. 145th Street, where the existing v/c is estimated to be .90 and the forecasted year 2020 v/c is estimated to be 1.08, and Greenwood Avenue N at 145th Street where existing outbound v/c is .5 and the forecasted year 2020 is 1.03 .

 These traffic volume and v/c figures reflect not only growth under Seattle's Comprehensive Plan, but also growth in the adjacent jurisdictions and throughout the central Puget Sound region. Much of the traffic on these arterials is through-traffic, with neither an origin nor a destination near the arterial.

 In addition to the City of Seattle's analysis of transportation impacts on adjacent jurisdictions, as described in this section, Seattle continues to work with the adjacent jurisdictions to coordinate traffic operations and to minimize cross-boundary impacts.

 Transportation Appendix E: State Highways in Seattle: Inventory, Projects and Impacts

 State Highways

 The City of Seattle cooperates with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Puget Sound Regional Council to plan improvements to state transportation facilities and services and to ensure that the City's plans are consistent with the State Transportation Plan and the Metropolitan Transportation Plan - Destination 2030. This section describes the state highways within the city, level-of-service standards on state highways, and impacts of the Comprehensive Plan and Regional growth plans on state highways. Other state transportation facilities are described in preceding sections of this chapter.

 Inventory

 There are ten state highways within Seattle city limits. They are shown in Transportation Figure A-1, and include: I-5, I-90, SR 99, SR 509, SR 513, SR 519, SR 520, SR 522, SR 523, and SR 900. I-5, I-90, SR 509, and SR 520 are limited access freeways. SR 99, while not classified as a limited access facility, functions as such through most of the segment between South Spokane Street and Winona Avenue North (near Green Lake), as well as south of the intersection of First Avenue South and East Marginal Way South.

 Transportation Figure A-16 summarizes general information on state highways in Seattle, as provided by WSDOT. Traffic volumes for the year 2002 and projected volumes for the year 2020 are shown in Transportation Figure A-17. The 2002 volumes were compiled from traffic counts collected by WSDOT (freeways) and Seattle Transportation (non-freeways.) The 2020 projections were developed using the City of Seattle traffic forecasting model with regional population and employment forecasts.

 The following are designated as "Highways of Statewide Significance" (HSS): I-5, I-90, SR 99, SR 509, SR 519, SR 520, and SR 522. Highways of statewide significance include, at a minimum, interstate highways and other principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities in the state. The state legislation designating HSS directs the State Transportation Commission to give higher priority for correcting identified deficiencies on highways of statewide significance. Non-HSS facilities in Seattle are SR 513, SR 523, and SR 900. These highways are monitored by the Puget Sound Regional Council for regional planning purposes.

 Level-of-Service Standards for Highways of Statewide Significance

 WSDOT is responsible for setting level-of-service standards on highways of statewide significance, while local jurisdictions work with the Puget Sound Regional Council to establish level-of-service standards on other state highways.

 WSDOT uses an Annual Average Daily Traffic to one hour capacity ratio (AADT/C) to determine the severity of congestion over a 24 hour period. Index values under this system range from 1 (little to no congestion) to 24 (theoretically, congestion over the entire 24 hour day). This congestion indicator enables the comparison of each highway's daily volume of traffic to a one-hour capacity.

 The Washington State Transportation Commission adopted this congestion index measure and established thresholds to identify "congested" highways at the index values of 10 for urban highways and 6 for rural highways. When compared to traditional peak hour measures, these thresholds approximate LOS D operation in urban areas and LOS C operation in rural areas. Highways above these thresholds are identified as deficient.

 WSDOT recognizes that achieving the preferred level of service for urban areas may require solutions other than increasing capacity in all locations. Mitigation can include providing alternatives, e.g., light rail or commuter rail parallel to I-5.

 Level-of-Service Standards for Regionally Significant Highways (Non- HSS)

 The Puget Sound regional Council is responsible for setting levels of standards for non-HSS highways.

 PSRC has adopted a three-tiered LOS standard that is designed to meet the needs of the Puget Sound region. These standards are as follows:

 * Tier 1 (LOS E-mitigated) is applied to all of the designated urban centers as well as a three mile buffer around the most heavily traveled freeways (I-5, I-90, I-405, SR 167, and SR 520)

 * Tier 2 (LOS D) is applied to the "outer" urban area outside the three mile buffer area and connecting the principal Urban Growth Area to the smaller Urban Growth Areas.

 * Tier 3 (LOS C) is applied to rural highway routes that would not fit into the Tier 2 category.

 In addition, non-HSS are incorporated into the City's level-of-service standards for arterial streets. The non-HSS are included in screenlines with other arterial streets.

 Impacts on State Highways

 The impacts of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan on state highways are not independent of impacts from the region's transportation and land use plans. Without growth in housing and employment in Seattle, traffic volumes on state highways would still increase due to growth in other parts of the region. Transportation Figure A-18 shows the allocation of year 2024 daily trips on each of the state highways within Seattle comparing trips with origins and destinations in Seattle compared with the rest of the region. Close to 50 percent of the trips on SR 99, SR 513, SR 519, and SR 522 within the city limits have both their origin and destination within the city limits. Only two state highways - I- 90 and SR 509 - have more than 10 percent of their trips with neither an origin nor destination in Seattle.

 Transportation Figure A-17 summarizes 2002 and projected 2020 traffic volumes and volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios on selected segments of state highways*. The use of V/C to indicate impacts is consistent with the methodology for measuring level-of-service standards on the City's arterial street system. In the case of arterial level-of- service standards, the City estimates V/C ratios across screenlines.

 State Highway Improvements

 The City of Seattle will continue to coordinate with WSDOT for consistency between our plans and projects. Transportation Figure A- 19 shows the Financially Constrained 20-Year Mobility Strategies from the 2002 to 2023 State Highway System Plan. In addition, the City of Seattle is participating in the planning and project development process for improvements to the SR 520 corridor across Lake Washington, and for addressing the Alaskan Way Viaduct portion of SR99.

 ATTACHMENT 11 HOUSING APPENDICES

 HOUSING APPENDIX OVERVIEW

 The appendix to the housing element presents information and analysis to aid policy decisions related to housing. The 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan also serves as a resource for housing data, objectives, strategies, and policies.

 1. SEATTLE'S EXISTING HOUSING NEEDS

 Housing costs that exceed 30% of a household's income are "unaffordable," per definition by HUD. Over half of Seattle's low- income households (those with incomes up to 80% of median family income (MFI pay more than they can afford for housing costs. The percentage increased from 52% in 1990 to 57% in 2000. The proportion of low-income households with worst case housing needs (those paying over 50% of their household income for housing costs) increased from 23% to 28% between 1990 and 2000. The 28% of low-income households with worst-case housing needs in 2000 is comprised of 19% renters and 9% homeowners, and totals almost 32,000 households according to 2000 Census data. These households are at high risk of becoming homeless or having to move out of Seattle for housing-affordability reasons.

 Renter Households with Housing Needs

 Housing Figure A-1 shows Seattle renter households with worst-case housing needs, broken down by household type and income. Extremely low-income households are those making up to 30% of the median family income. Very low-income households make between 31% and 50% of the median family income, and low-moderate-income households are those making between 51% and 80% of the median family income. Singles living alone or with other unrelated individuals account for the majority of all low-income households in Seattle. Over 60% of extremely low-income singles living alone or with other unrelated individuals pay more than 50% of their monthly income for rent and utilities. This particular population group ranks first, both in absolute numbers (10,102) and percent (61%) with worst-case housing needs. Among small family households (2-4 related persons, including couples without children), 58% or 2,935 of those with extremely low- incomes pay over 50% of their monthly income for rent and utilities. Another 695 extremely low-income families of 5 or more related persons have worst-case housing needs (57% of total number of households of this type). Seniors with extremely- and very-low-incomes have the next highest proportion paying over 50% of monthly income for rental housing costs: 36% or 2,527 among seniors with extremely low-income seniors and 27% or 960 of very low-income seniors.

 Housing Figures A-2a through A-2d show total numbers of low-income renter households and, of those, how many pay more than 30% and 50% of their household income for rent and utilities in 1990 compared to 2000. Housing cost burden trends for low-income renters improved between 1990 and 2000 for certain household types, particularly small families with or without children with incomes 0-50% MFI and large families with incomes 31-50% MFI.

 For low-income 2-4 person families, the number of those paying more than they can afford for rent and utilities decreased by 7% in the past decade. For large families with 5 or more persons, 8% fewer were paying more than 30% of their income for housing costs and 12% more were paying more than 50% of their income for housing costs in 2000 compared to 1990. The total number of low-income family households who rent housing in Seattle declined 1% during that same time.

 The decline in the total number of low-income senior renters was steeper, at 14%. The number of those who pay more than 30% of their income for housing costs dropped 18%, but the number with severe housing cost burdens (greater than 50% of income) increased 1% between 1990 and 2000.

 Singles living either alone or with others are the only type of low- income renter household to increase in Seattle in the 1990s. Overall, the number of households of this type increased 19%. As shown on Housing Figure A-2a, the number paying more than they can afford for rental housing costs increased 15%, which is proportionally less than the net gain of total households comprised of a single person or a group of single persons. The level of need among households of this type is still great, however, with over 13,000 low-income households comprised of single individuals who rent apartments or houses in Seattle paying more than half of their income for housing costs in 2000.

 Homeowner Households with Housing Needs

 Housing Figure A-7 shows Seattle households who own their homes and have worst-case housing needs, broken down by household type and income. Extremely low-income families and singles who own their homes are most likely to be severely burdened by their housing costs. Among households with incomes up to 30% of MFI, 74% of small families (including couples without children), 70% of singles and unrelated individuals, and 68% of large families pay more than half of their income for mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities. Among the 3854 extremely low-income senior households who own their homes, 1757 pay over half of their income for housing costs. High home prices and rising tax costs are impacting owner households with incomes above 30% of MFI as well.

 Housing cost burden for low-income (0-80% of MFI) homeowners has worsened dramatically since 1990. The total number of low-income seniors who own their homes decreased 21% between 1990 and 2000, but the number of senior households who are paying more than they can afford for mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities increased 45%. The number of low-income senior homeowners who pay over half of their income for housing costs increased 78%. See Housing Figure A-8a for more detail.

 Data also shows rapidly escalating housing costs for other low-income homeowners as well. The total number of low-income non-senior households who own their homes increased 14% between 1990 and 2000, but the number of those who are paying more than they can afford for mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities increased 46%. The number of low-income households (excluding seniors) who pay over half of their income for homeownership-related housing costs increased 89% between 1990 and 2000. See Housing Figure 8b for more detail.

 Housing Figures A-9 and A-10 illustrate the negative trends for low- income homeowners in terms of rapid escalation of housing costs in the 1990s. (The 1990 data includes cost burden statistics for senior homeowners, but not for other specific types of homeowner households.) This trend has continued to accelerate since 2000, in spite of a recessionary economic environment.

 Homeless and Special Needs Populations

 An estimated 8,000 homeless men, women and children are on the streets or in shelters or emergency housing in King County on any given night. The majority of these individuals are located within the City of Seattle. A one-night count of homeless individuals conducted in Seattle in October 2003 identified 1,899 people actually living on the streets. In addition, 4,617 individuals in 3,126 households were staying in shelters and transitional housing. Most of these individuals are between the ages of 25 and 59. Approximately 56% are persons of color. Ninety-eight percent of these individuals report either having no source of income or extremely low-income (0-30% MFI) through SSI, unemployment insurance, or state general assistance.

 The one-night count data may underestimate the level of need in the region. For example, DESC, which operates the largest shelter in Seattle and prioritizes its shelter capacity for individuals with chronic and severe conditions such as mental illness, provided shelter services to more than 10,000 unduplicated persons in 2003 and general services to more than 11,000. In 2002, the local Seattle-King County Health Care for the Homeless Network (HCHN) provided care to over 22,000 unduplicated homeless people and those at high risk of recurring homelessness, including 2,396 unduplicated single adults in downtown shelters.

 A significant proportion of homeless individuals in the Seattle area meet the definition of "chronic homelessness" (homeless for a year or longer or have had four or more episodes of homelessness in the past three years, and are disabled). Of single adults served by HCHN during 2002, 43% had been homeless for at least one year. In addition, 42% of the homeless single adults counted in October 2003 reported having at least one disabling condition (28% reported mental illness, 32% reported alcohol or substance abuse, 14% reported co- occurring disorders, 10% reported physical disabilities, and 3% reported HIV/AIDS). HCHN estimates that, based on 2002 service data, at least 4,973 men and women in the downtown Seattle area meet the definition of chronic homelessness.

 Additional data underscores the nature and extent of the disabilities with which these populations struggle:

 * Mental illness: Sixteen percent (4,322) of the individuals receiving services from the publicly funded mental health Regional Support Network were homeless at some point during 2002. More than 30% (1,222) of the individuals served at King County's behavioral health crisis triage center during 2002 reported being currently vhomeless.

 * Chemical dependency: An estimated 28,650 low-income adults in King County are chemically dependent and in need of treatment in any given year. Between 12,000 and 18,750 of these individuals are both mentally ill and chemically dependent, yet fewer than 10% receive the services they require to promote stabilization and recovery. Data from HCHN indicates that 22% of their clients need chemical dependency treatment. In 2003, King County documented over 2,000 adults in Seattle seeking services due to mental illness and/or chemical dependency. In addition, there are 350 people with chronic mental illness living in boarding homes in Seattle who need permanent vsupportive housing.

 * HIV/AIDS: More than 2,000 individuals are currently living with HIV/AIDS in King County, with an additional 6,000 to 9,000 persons estimated to be infected with HIV. Housing services are requested by 50% of the total AIDS population and actual housing units are among 33% of those living with AIDS.

 * Chronic & acute medical conditions: Chronically homeless people in Seattle suffer from chronic and acute medical conditions at rates far higher than the general population. Hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, skin conditions, trauma and tuberculosis are common conditions.

 Research shows that the provision of housing by itself, or the delivery of intensive supportive services in isolation from housing, are both insufficient to promote stability over time for most individuals struggling with homelessness, mental illness, and co- occurring disorders such as substance abuse disorders, developmental disabilities, and HIV/AIDS or other chronic health problems. Provision of supportive housing, combined with appropriate treatment and support, is critical.

 WHO ARE WE PLANNING FOR?

 The number of people living in Seattle grew over nine percent during the 1990s, averaging 0.009 percent annually, but the pace of growth appears to have slowed since to average 0.005 percent annually. The Comprehensive Plan anticipates population growth to average about 0.008 between 2000 and 2020.

 Seattle's population, like the nation's, is becoming older and more diverse in terms of race and Hispanic ethnicity. Birth rates are low in Seattle; on average women in Seattle have 1.23 children compared to 2.0 for the U.S. overall. Conversely, life expectancy continues to rise. As a consequence, natural increase accounted for one-third of Seattle's growth between 1990 and 2000. But birth rates cannot go much lower than they are now. On the contrary, because of Seattle's appeal to international migrant's future birth rates are likely to increase rather than decline further. On average immigrants have higher birth rates than people born in the U.S. and immigrants accounted for 17 percent of Seattle residents in 2000.

 Since Seattle households continue to increase in number faster than the population the average number of people per household persists in its downward slide. Down from 2.70 in 1960, Seattle households averaged 2.08 people in 2000--the third lowest of all U.S. cities with populations of at least 100,000 and down from 2.70 in 1960.

 Because individuals shape our households, changes in the population have translated into a more diverse mix of household types in Seattle. Low birth and death rates; an increasing share of people born abroad and changes in their origin; changes in the numbers and ages of people migrating into and out of Seattle; and the aging of residents already here have all had a role in the mix of households now in place.

 Since 1980, the biggest change in the makeup of Seattle households was the growth of nonfamily households; one-person living alone and unrelated people living together grew by 40,000 (see Figure A-11). At the same time households comprised of a married couple with at least one child decreased by over 5,000. In percentage terms, nonfamily households nearly doubled between 1980 and 2000 and family households with a child who lived without a parent increased 17 percent.

 In 2000 the largest share of Seattle households--41 percent-were one- person living alone, 20 percent were a married couple without children; 15 percent were two or more unrelated persons living together; 13 percent were a married couple with at least one child; 6 percent were one-parent households with at least one child and another five percent of households were another type of family without a child (see Housing Figure A-12). Less than one in five Seattle households included a child.

 Between 2000 and 2020 the largest change in the number of households among these types is an increase of about 22,000 one-person households; next largest, an increase in married couples without children of nearly 14,000; and a 5,000 household increase in families with children that do not include a parent of the child.

 HOUSING GROWTH AND CAPACITY FOR DEVELOPMENT

 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT TRENDS

 Residential development trends in Seattle over the last forty years have generally followed cyclical expansions and contractions in employment growth in the region. Significant increases in housing occurred in the early 1990s and between 1999 and 2002. These housing booms were followed by slowdowns in housing construction starting in 1992 and 2003.

 Since the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan in 1994, Seattle has averaged a net addition of 2,300 residential units a year, according to City permit records. Development activity was strongest between 1999 and 2002, with a peak of 3,800 net new units completed in 2001. After very strong housing growth between 1999 and 2002, development of new housing has dropped as a result of a weak economy and a related slow-down of immigration into the state and city. In January of 2000, there were active permits for an additional 7,000 units including units under construction. In April of 2004, that number had dropped to 4,500.

[Housing Fibure A-15 - Annual City of Seattle Housing Growth](/~ordpics/115137At11FigHA15.gif)

 Most new housing development in Seattle is in multifamily development in Multifamily, Commercial, and Downtown zones. Thirteen percent of units built in Seattle since 1994 have been built in single-family zones, an average of 300 units a year. Just over one-third of development has occurred in multifamily zones, 28% of development in commercial areas outside of downtown and downtown Seattle accommodating 23% of all housing units built since 1994.

 The Comprehensive Plan estimates a net increase of 47,000 households in Seattle between 2004 and 2024.

 CAPACITY FOR ADDITIONAL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT

 As of 2004, Seattle has an estimated unused zoned residential development capacity of 116,000 new housing units, or two-and-a-half times the amount of housing estimated to locate in Seattle over the next twenty years (see Housing Figures A-16 and A-17.) At the time the capacity figure was developed, Seattle had 268,000 housing units, so the total housing stock would be 384,000 housing units if all this capacity were used.

[Housing Figure A-17 - Seattle Residential Development Capacity, 2004](/~ordpics/115137At11FigHA17.gif)

 Residential development capacity includes vacant land in residential zones, underutilized sites in residential zones, and some of the vacant and underutilized sites in commercial zones. Underutilized sites are sites where the existing developed density is low compared to the allowed developed density, or where the value of the improvements on the site is low compared to the value of the land.

 STRATEGIES FOR MEETING HOUSING NEEDS

 The City of Seattle's Office of Housing (OH) has four priorities for increasing housing opportunities:

 * Investing in production and preservation of affordable housing;

 * Providing housing linked with supportive services for people who are homeless or have special needs;

 * Increasing homeownership opportunities; and

 * Promoting housing production and preservation that supports neighborhood revitalization and other community development efforts.

 OH and the City's nonprofit partners make leveraging of the City's 7- year, $86 million Housing Levy and other City housing funds a top priority. For every $1 of City funding for affordable rental housing, over $3 is leveraged from other public and private capital sources, increasing the amount of affordable housing that can be provided in Seattle.

 Affordable Rental Housing

 Over the past two decades, the City of Seattle has provided funding for affordable housing serving low-income families, seniors, low-wage working people and people with disabilities. The City-funded portfolio of below-market-rent apartments has grown to 7,793 housing units in 238 development projects. This housing includes a range of apartment sizes in small and large developments dispersed throughout the city.

[Housing Figure A-18 - City-Funded Rental Housing Portfolio by Unit Size (12/31/03)](/~ordpics/115137At11FigHA18.gif)

 This affordable housing is a significant asset for Seattle. Nearly half of the housing units are reserved for extremely low-income households with incomes up to 30 percent of the region's median household income ($16,350 for an individual or $21,050 for a family of three in 2004). These housing units are often combined with supportive services to assist residents to live independently or transition out of homelessness. Much of the balance of OH's housing portfolio is workforce housing serving individuals and families with incomes up to 50 or 60 percent of the median income (up to $32,700 for an individual or $42,050 for a family of three). For lower-income residents, paying an affordable rent frees up resources for other important needs such as food, medical expenses, clothing, transportation, and education.

[ Housing Figure A-19 - City-Funded Rental Housing Portfolio by Affordability (12/31/03) ](/~ordpics/115137At11FigHA19.gif)

 The City plays a monitoring and oversight role to ensure that the units remain affordable and continue to serve the intended residents as time goes by, and that the buildings themselves remain in good physical condition and are financially viable. This ongoing asset management of the projects ensures that Seattle-funded developments continue to operate well into the future.

 Service-Enriched Housing

 Service-enriched housing is a successful housing model for stabilizing and moving many vulnerable people along a path to self-sufficiency. Affordable housing linked to accessible health, mental health, employment, childcare and other services offers the support that these individuals and families need to succeed. Service-enriched housing gives homeless people a way out of expensive emergency public services and into their own homes and communities; it both improves the lives of its residents and can generate significant public savings.

 For the City of Seattle, service-enriched housing has long been a priority. Of the 7,793 City funded affordable rental units, 34% (2,984) serve homeless and special needs residents. This housing can be in stand-alone projects or units set aside within larger, general population apartment buildings. Most of the special needs housing, 2,445 units, serve families and individuals who are also homeless; 630 are transitional units and 1,815 provide a permanent residence.

[ Housing Figure A-20 - ](/~ordpics/115137At11FigHA20.gif)

 OH provides operating support to projects that serve homeless and special needs residents. Due to the extremely low incomes of the tenants, rents are insufficient to cover building operations costs. OH provides annual operating subsidies to 530 units using 1986, 1995 and 2002 Levy funding. In addition, project-based Section 8 rental assistance provided through the Seattle Housing Authority supports 970 City-funded units.

 Homebuyer Assistance

 Homeownership allows families to build equity and accumulate savings. Homeownership opportunities within the city allow people to live closer to where they work, and shorter commutes benefit the families and the entire community. In Seattle, however, incomes have not kept pace with home prices. The median sales price reached $310,000 in 2003, which would require an annual income of $75,000 to purchase (assuming a 30-year term loan at 6% interest and 10% downpayment). The city's homeownership rate, at 48.4%, is low compared to the state and county, and over the past decades, minorities have lost ground in homeownership while whites have gained slightly.

 City homebuyer programs have helped make homeownership an option for low-income residents while, at the same time, providing community development benefits to the neighborhood. OH assists with the development of affordable houses and provides downpayment assistance to help low-income families purchase their first home. Homebuyers earning 80% or less of the area median income apply for loans through nonprofit providers, participating lenders and housing developers that have received an allocation of City funds.

 Home Repair Assistance for Low-Income Homeowners

 Low-income homeowners often lack sufficient resources to properly maintain their homes. Even with substantial equity, these homeowners are unable to qualify for traditional loans. Without adequate maintenance, the homes deteriorate and can threaten the health and safety of the occupants and the neighborhood.

 OH's HomeWise Rehab Loan Program assists low-income homeowners to keep their homes in good repair. HomeWise staff inspect the home, establish a scope of work, assist the homeowners with bid solicitation and contractor selection, and inspect completed work. The repairs can include roof replacement, furnace replacement, sewer and plumbing repair, access ramps, porch and deck repair or replacement, siding and/or exterior paint, floor repairs, kitchen and bathroom improvements, needed door and window repair or replacement and foundation repair.

 Weatherization Assistance for Low-Income Households

 Low-income homeowners and renters can save on housing costs as a result of City-funded water conservation programs and OH's HomeWise Weatherization Program. With funding from Seattle City Light and the State, HomeWise installs energy-saving improvements in single-family and multifamily buildings serving low-income tenants, as well as homes occupied by low-income homeowners.

 Weatherization improvements can include insulation, air sealing and duct repair, furnace repair or replacement, window repair or replacement, lighting upgrades, ventilation and indoor air quality improvements, and refrigerator replacement. The result is lower heating and utility bills, a more comfortable home environment, and reduced consumption of natural resources. As utility rates increase, so does the value of the energy-saving measures.

 SEATTLE'S ASSISTED RENTAL HOUSING INVENTORY

 As of May 2004, the Office of Housing's (OH) Subsidized Rental Housing Database showed that there were 20,277 affordable rental units with capital subsidies in Seattle. As noted, in Section 4 of this Appendix, 7,793 of these units were in 238 City-funded projects, as of 12/31/03. The remaining units have capital subsidies through federal, state, or county programs but are not City-funded. The following table summarizes affordability of Seattle's subsidized rental housing stock:

 Housing Figure A-21 Rental Housing Units with Capital Subsidies, by Affordability

 Affordability Number of Units 0-30% of MFI 10,568 31-50% of MFI 6,230 51-80% of MFI 3,479 TOTAL 20,277

 As of May 2004, 5,341 vouchers were being used to lease apartments in Seattle. This number excludes vouchers used in Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) Seattle Senior Housing Program buildings and buildings with federal financing through the Moderate Rehabilitation Program (which are part of the 20,277 rental units with capital subsidies shown above). It also excludes vouchers that have been project-based or are being used outside of Seattle. It does include vouchers provided by other housing authorities that are being used to lease units in Seattle. At least 570 of the 5,341 vouchers are being used to lease units in buildings with capital subsidies.

 The inventory of assisted rental housing in Seattle, including both units with project-based subsidies and units with tenant-based subsidies is approximately 25,000 units.

 1. Fire Department

 Inventory:

 The Seattle Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services throughout the city from 33 fire stations and Harborview Medical Center. Headquarters for the department are located at Fire Station 10 in Pioneer Square. Fire Department facilities and capacities are shown in Capital Facilities Figure A-1 and the location list provided below.

 Each station provides a full range of fire protective services including fire suppression, emergency medical, rescue and salvage. While each station is equipped with at least one fire engine (except Fire Station 14), other equipment varies by facility. The Fire Department has 33 engine companies, 11 ladder truck companies, two fire boats, four aid units, seven paramedic units and other specialized units including heavy rescue, hazardous materials, and marine fire fighting that provide a broad range of emergency services to existing development.

 Planning Goals:

 In 2002, the Seattle Fire Department responded to all EMS related calls in four minutes or less 77.5 percent of the time and to all fire related calls in four minutes or less 79.56 percent of the time. The fire-fighting industry has set four minutes 90 percent of the time as a desirable response time.

 Response time is influenced directly by the availability of fire personnel, equipment, traffic conditions, and the number and location of fire stations. Further, firefighter and equipment requirements indirectly affect station requirements. Buildings and associated densities are critical factors in estimating fire fighter requirements. These requirements are estimated on an annual basis through the City's budget process.

 Existing Capacity and Anticipated Future Needs:

 The current facilities and their distribution are inadequate to maintain the desired response time to existing development and the amount of new development expected over the next six years in the Urban Centers and throughout the city. Additional EMS capabilities will be needed downtown near South Lake Union, SODO, Northgate, and the Central District. A new Fire Alarm Center is needed to replace the current facility, and all 33 stations need major upgrades, renovation or replacement in order to continue to provide service. In order to serve expected growth over the next 20 years, the Fire Department will need a new station in the Northgate area and most likely one in the downtown area. A new command and control center will also be needed.

 In 2003, Seattle voters approved the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy Under, which will provide about $167 million to: upgrade, renovate, or replace 32 neighborhood fire stations; construct a new training facility and upgrade the Department's Fire Alarm Center; establish emergency preparedness facilities and disaster response equipment that includes a seismically safe Emergency Operations Center, emergency community supplies, emergency shelter power generators, and emergency water supply capacity for fire fighting in the event the City's fire hydrants are disabled; and a new, large platform fire boat, a rehabilitated and enhanced Chief Seattle fireboat, and a new fast attack small fire rescue boat.

 The Department is exploring relocation and renovation/rebuilding options to promote service efficiencies and to address space needs for larger equipment. In addition, the Department is currently evaluating its emergency medical capabilities and staffing or equipment additions that may be desirable to improve emergency medical service. Additionally, the Department is reviewing its capabilities for providing enhanced services related to homeland security and natural disasters.

 2. Police Department

 Inventory:

 The Seattle Police Department currently provides law enforcement patrol services to the city from five precincts. The locations and capacities of these precincts are shown in Figure A-2 and the list below:

 1. North Precinct, at 10049 College Way North, serves the area north of the Ship Canal to the City limits and has a capacity of 16,779 square feet (sq ft).

 2. West Precinct, located at 810 Virginia Street serves Queen Anne, Magnolia, the downtown core, and the area west of I-5 and north of Spokane Street, and has a capacity of 50,960 square feet (including the 9-1-1 center).

 3. East Precinct, located at 1519 12th Avenue, serves the area north of I-90 to the Ship Canal and east of I-5, including the Eastlake Community and has a capacity of 40,000 square feet.

 4. South Precinct, at 3001 South Myrtle Street, serves Southeast Seattle, the area south of I-90 to the city limits and has a capacity of 13,688 square feet.

 5. The Southwest Precinct, at 2300 S.W. Webster, serves West Seattle and the Duwamish Waterway and has a capacity of 28,150 square feet.

 Other Police facilities owned and/or operated by SPD include:

 1. The facility for Mounted Patrol Unit at 9200 8th SW has 18,890 square feet for offices and a horse arena, and a capacity of 12 full- time stalls and space for housing related equipment and supplies.

 2. The kennel for the K-9 Unit of Police dogs, located at the SPD pistol range in South Seattle near Boeing Field, has a capacity of 6,464 sq ft, housing 6 dogs and 2 pups and related equipment and supplies.

 3. The Harbor Unit facility on the north shore of Lake Union has a capacity of 3,706 square feet for offices, shop, dock, and two boat sheds, plus docks which moor nine Patrol boats. The facility also has extra dock areas for temporary moorage.

 4. The Seattle Police Headquarters, located at 610 5th Avenue, houses the administrative units of the police department along with a number of detective units.

 5. The Public Safety Building, located at 610 3rd Avenue contains the SPD Traffic Section, a number of detective units, and warehouse functions that are scheduled to move into a new facility in 2004.

 The SPD Seattle Center component handles events at the Center, as well as the Police Reserves. In addition to these permanent facilities, the Police Department has two mobile mini-precincts that they locate in various areas as activities dictate. One of the mobile mini- precincts is permanently assigned to West Seattle.

 Planning Goals:

 Uniform patrol law enforcement services are generally allocated based on workload, time and location. The exact location of facilities is usually not critical to the provision of uniform patrol services, since police officers are on patrol in the various sectors and calls for service are dispatched by radio or officers handle situations "on view". However, the location of facilities can be important because of distance traveled at shift change time and because good locations can enhance Police/community interaction and communication.

 Because of the many and changing factors that affect staffing and space objectives of police departments, there are no universally accepted planning goals for police facilities related to performance measures. The forecast of future needs is therefore based on guidelines for office space that incorporate special space requirements related to public safety, using the East Precinct as a model.

 Existing Capacity and Anticipated Future Needs:

 The North Precinct is currently overcrowded and does not meet the needs of precinct personnel. In order to serve the growth forecast under the Comprehensive Plan over the next 20 years in the Urban Centers and throughout the City, it is anticipated that additional space may be required in the North Precinct. At this time the exact space requirements are not known and will depend on a variety of factors, as discussed under Planning Goals. As the City further considers neighborhood-based policing options, the long-range plans for police facilities may change.

[Capital Facilities Figure A-2 - Seattle Police Precincts](/~ordpics/115137At11FigCFA2.gif)

 3. Public Schools

 Inventory:

 District facilities include 11 high schools, 10 middle schools, 62 elementary schools, 16 alternative schools and Memorial Stadium. In addition, the District has a number of closed schools. Many of the school closures occurred during the 1970s and 1980s as a result of low enrollments. The closed schools are used for temporary schools during remodeling construction, leased to other organizations on a short or long-term basis or remain unused. In September 2002 the District opened a newly renovated administrative headquarters in SODO area, John Stanford Center for Educational Excellence. School locations are shown in Capital Facilities Figure A-3.

 The capacity for school facilities varies by school type as follows: 380-535 students for elementary schools; 600-800 students for middle schools; and 1,000-1,600 students for high schools. Memorial Stadium has a seating capacity of 12,000.

 Planning Goals:

 The School District has established the following planning goals for new or modernized school facilities:

 School Size Site Size (Minimum) Elementary School 380, 445 or 535 students 4 acres

 Middle School 600 to 800 students, except 12 acres for alternative programs, which could be smaller

 High School 1,000 to 1,600 students, 17 acres except for alternative programs, which could be smaller

 The District plans facilities based on where growth is expected in school age populations of children that would be expected to attend public school. Through the current "choice" student assignment plan, about 75 percent of the children that attend public schools choose and attend the school in their neighborhood and 25 percent choose other schools.

 Existing Capacity and Anticipated Future Needs:

 In 1991, the School District completed a six-year capital improvement program, known as CIP I. In preparation for the next CIP, the School Board adopted the long-range Facilities Master Plan and Capital Improvement Program. The Capital Improvement Program was divided into several phases. Funding for the CIP, known as Building Excellence I Program (BEX I), was approved by the voters in February 1995.

 The BEX I program covered six years, 1995-2000, and contained 19 projects. The projects included modernization, historic renovation, replacement and/or expansion of elementary and secondary schools, to meet existing requirements. These improvements added some capacity which reduced portable buildings and eased crowding in South Seattle.

 The most recent capital levy program, known as the Building Excellence II Program (BEX II), covers new construction, renovation, or additions at 17 school facilities. BEX II, approved by voters in February 2001, continues BEX I with $398 million over the next six years

 The School District's Facilities Master Plan (FMP) guides facilities decisions through the year 2010. Over the course of the two capital improvement programs, BEX I and BEX II capacity will be added to eliminate the need for portable buildings.

 The schools outlined in the FMP are in locations that can serve Urban Centers, Urban Villages and the remainder of the city. The FMP recognizes that the shift in trends, as Urban Centers and Villages develop, could be gradual or rapid and will vary throughout the city. The District is committed to reviewing and adjusting its FMP every five years, to be responsive to changing conditions.

 3. General Government

 The City of Seattle is in the process of revitalizing its downtown civic campus. Currently five city-owned buildings comprise the civic campus, with a capacity of 1.7 million square feet (sq ft) in the downtown core: New City Hall (186,000 sq ft), Justice Center (272,000 sq ft), Arctic Building (101,000 sq ft), Alaska Building (147,000 sq ft) and the Seattle Municipal Tower (1 million sq. ft., of which approximately 920,000 sq. ft. are currently used for City office space). The City also leases about 24,000 square feet in nearby buildings downtown. The City's Sea-Park Garage provides parking for city vehicles and visitor parking within the civic campus.

 The Public Safety Building (291,000 sq ft) is mostly vacant, and scheduled for demolition in 2004. Current plans are to sell the Arctic and Alaska Buildings in 2004-2006. The City sold the Dexter- Horton Building (350,000 sq ft) in 2001.

 Exclusive of fire stations and police precincts, the City owns more than 30 other general government facilities located outside of downtown, and leases an average of 50,000 square feet. These provide a wide variety of services, primarily to other city departments, and include maintenance shops, warehouses, and support facilities for the public safety functions.

 In addition, The City also operates 13 storefront Neighborhood Service Centers located throughout the city. These offices range in size from 750 - 2,100 square feet and serve as City information and community contact points, as well as bill payment depositories. Eight are located in leased space, while five are co-located with other city facilities such as libraries, fire stations and community centers. These are shown in Capital Facilities Figure A-6.

 4. Seattle Center

 There are 37 buildings on the 87-acre Seattle Center campus totally in excess of over 2.5 million square feet. These facilities serve more than 10 million visitors a year and present over 5,000 performances or events annually. The campus meeting, performance, educational, exhibition, sports, recreational, gathering spaces and open space are dedicated to meeting the cultural, artistic, educational, recreational, and entertainment needs of the region.

 The Center is home to twelve theater spaces ranging in capacity from 100 seats in the Center House Theater to 2,800 at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall and totaling nearly 6,000 seats for theatrical performances. Sports facilities include the Key Arena with a capacity of 17,000 and Memorial Stadium with a capacity of 12,000 for field events. There are two schools on the campus - a ballet school and a public high school. There are 10 fountains on the grounds and approximately 39 acres of landscaped and green open space and pedestrian ways. There are also active outdoor spaces, including the Fun Forest amusements, a basketball court, and a skate park. Seattle Center's outdoor open spaces, gardens, and fountains are a major urban oasis for active or passive and individual or group enjoyment.

 The Center owns and manages four surface parking lots and two parking garages totaling 3,517 spaces. The Seattle Center is also served by the Seattle Center Monorail between downtown and the Center. The Monorail carries more than 2 million riders a year over the mile-long route.

 Notable buildings and facilities on the Seattle Center campus include: Center House; Key Arena; the Space Needle; Experience Music Project; Memorial Stadium; Pacific Science Center; McCaw Hall; Phelps Center and Ballet School; Seattle Children's Theatre; Bagley Wright Theatre; Intiman Theatre; Seattle Children's Museum; Fisher Pavilion; the Northwest Rooms; Mercer Arena; and the Seattle Center Pavilion.

 Inventory of Facilities Serving Urban Centers and Villages

 Following is an inventory of facilities that serve Urban Centers and Urban Villages. Facilities do not have to be located within the boundaries or potential boundaries of the Centers or Villages in order to serve those areas.

 City facilities that are either designated City of Seattle Landmarks or historic resources (including parks that include one or more of these facilities) are identified in the lists of facilities for each urban center and village. "Historic resources" are at least 40 years old and have been reviewed by a historic preservation specialist; these resources may or may not be eligible for designation as landmarks.

 ATTACHMENT 13 UTILITIES APPENDICES

 Utilities Appendix A:

 Inventory of City Utilities, Capacity Information and Future Facility Needs

 Seattle City Light

 Seattle City Light (SCL) is the City-owned electric utility serving approximately 131 square miles, including all of Seattle and some portions of King County north and south of Seattle city limits.

 Inventory

 SCL generates between 56 percent and 75 percent of the energy that it sells to retail customers from its own facilities. This percent share varies with water conditions because all SCL-owned resources are hydroelectric. The largest facilities are the Boundary Project, on the Pend Oreille River in northeast Washington, and the Skagit Project, which consists of three hydroelectric dams (Ross, Diablo and Gorge) on the Skagit River. The Newhalem Hydroelectric Plant, located on Newhalem Creek, was built in 1921 to supply power to the Skagit Project. It was modernized in 1970 and produces a small amount of energy. The Cedar Falls Dam on the Cedar River and the South Fork Tolt Dam on the South Fork Tolt River are also smaller generating facilities owned by SCL. In addition to these power sources, SCL purchases power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), including firm amounts under the Block Product and a share in the output from the Federal System (Slice Product), which depends on water conditions. SCL also holds firm power purchase contracts with a number of other suppliers in the Pacific Northwest. These contracts include power generated from hydroelectric sources, including a combined-cycle combustion turbine (Klamath Falls in Oregon) and a share in the State Line Wind Project located in Southeast Washington and Northeast Oregon. (See Utilities Figure A-1.)

 SCL owns and maintains approximately 657 miles of transmission lines which carry power from the Skagit and Cedar Falls generating facilities to 14 principal substations. SCL is dependent on other transmission line owners, i.e., the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), to bring power from its Boundary Dam hydroelectric plant and from other contracted resources, to serve its load in Seattle. The transmission grid interconnection with other utilities also provides additional reliability to meet load requirements. Power is distributed from SCL's principal substations via high voltage feeder lines to numerous smaller distribution substations and pole transformers which reduce voltage to required levels for customers. SCL owns and maintains 2,428 circuit-miles of distribution lines within Seattle that deliver power from the 14 principal substations to approximately 365,200 customers. (See Utilities Figure A-2).

 Existing Capacity

 SCL's current generation capability (owned and contracted) is adequate to serve existing customers. Because of the nature of City Light's hydroelectric system, the utility is not presently constrained by its ability to meet peak loads (typically referred to as capacity). At times, the system may be constrained in its ability to carry load over periods of heavy load hours (6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) during the winter. On an average monthly basis, City Light currently has sufficient resources to meet expected customer load in the next few years, even under serious drought conditions.

 SCL sells on the wholesale energy markets the energy it does not need to meet customer load. The utility also buys energy in the wholesale markets to enhance the value of its resource portfolio and to meet occasional short-term energy deficits.

 Anticipated Future Facilities

 City Light's current contract with BPA extends through the end of September 2011 and includes an increase in the firm amount of power purchased effective in October 2006. The utility has committed to meet its load growth through 2011 with conservation and renewable resources and is on target to achieve this goal. Given projected customer load growth, no significant resource addition is anticipated until 2005 or 2006.

 For the transmission and distribution components of SCL's system, projected growth will be accommodated by planned transmission and distribution capacity additions. The addition of a transformer at the Bothell Substation in Snohomish County will serve the principal substations from the Snohomish County line to the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Within the Comprehensive Plan's 20-year timeframe a new principal substation will be necessary downtown, with an underground transmission line connection to the South substation. Capacity would also be expanded at the North, Duwamish, Shoreline, University and Creston substations. New substations also may be built in the next five to twenty years at Interbay, in the SODO area and in South Lake Union, depending on load growth projections and emerging real construction. Substations in the Northeast and Northwest parts of the City may also be built in the 20-year period. City Light owns properties for the Interbay, NE and NW substations.

[Utilities Figure A-2 - Seattle City Light Transmission Lines and Substations](/~ordpics/115137At13FigA-2.gif)

 Seattle Public Utilities (Water Utility)

 Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) provides water service to customers of Seattle and portions of King County. In addition, SPU sells wholesale water to more than two dozen suburban water districts, municipalities, and nonprofit water associations ("purveyors") which serve retail water customers in most of the urban areas in north, east, and south King County, and a small part of southwest Snohomish County. (See Utilities Figure A-3). SPU operates under an Operator's Certificate granted by the State Department of Health. Information about the certificate and the water system can be found in Seattle's Water System Plan.

 Inventory

 SPU supplies drinking water from two major water supply sources, the Cedar River Watershed and the South Fork of the Tolt River Watershed, and a small amount of water from the Highline Well Field. The Cedar River of the Tolt River watersheds are in the Cascade Mountains, while the Highline Well Field is located north of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Transmission pipelines carry the water to various reservoirs, standpipes, and tanks for further distribution. (See Utilities Figure A-4)

 Existing Capacity

 SPU's service area extends beyond the City's boundaries, making it impossible to assign for in-city service capacity figures to the supply sources and transmission lines. Snowpack, temperature and precipitation in the watershed areas are important natural factors that determine when and how much runoff will fill the reservoirs. Also affecting SPU's water supply is the environmental impact of the dams on the stream flows. Tribes and business, environmental, recreational and fisheries groups all have interests in the level of water in the streams. The 50-year Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan provides certainty for the City of Seattle's drinking water supply and protects and restores fish and wildlife habitats. In addition, the City recently completed a new treatment facility on the Tolt source that adds supply capacity. A new treatment facility on the Cedar source will be come online in 2004 that will improve drinking water quality. Under these current circumstances, SPU expects water supply to be adequate to serve the City's existing and forecast population for at least the next 20 years.

 Distribution and storage facilities that serve Seattle residents have adequate capacity to serve the city. There are, however, a few areas that have substandard mains or experience low water pressure.

 Low pressure areas include the higher elevations and other scattered locations in Maple Leaf (Maple Leaf Tank), Phinney Ridge (Woodland Park Standpipe), and Queen Anne Hill (Queen Anne Standpipe). These areas are all located near standpipe or/tanks and, therefore, receive water at or below the current design standard of 30 pounds per square inch (psi).

[Utilities Figure A-3 - Water Service Area](/~ordpics/115137At13FigA-3.gif)

[Utilities Figure A-4 - Major Water Facilities](/~ordpics/115137At13FigA-4.gif)

 SPU is currently applying an asset management assessment to determine which pipelines would be replaced using the funds available in the six year CIP.

 Anticipated Future Facilities

 Most of the new households to be added within the city will be in multifamily units, which have a much lower per capita water demand than single family households.

 The major impact of the growth envisioned by the Comprehensive Plan on the City's water facilities will be in the distribution system. Rehabilitation and improvements to the existing distribution system will be needed to support growth over the 20 year life of the Plan. SPU will work with developers to be sure needed infrastructure is in place for the development. Most of the time, developers finance the necessary distribution facilities.

 Seattle Public Utilities (Drainage and Wastewater)

 SPU is charged with managing drainage, surface runoff, and sewer systems to meet public safety, water quality, and resource protection goals. SPU's service area covers the City of Seattle.

 Inventory

 Although a few small areas are still served by septic systems, almost all areas of the city are served by sanitary sewers. Three types of drainage and waste water systems are used in Seattle: combined sanitary/storm water sewer, partially separated sanitary/storm water sewer, and separate sanitary and storm water sewer systems. The SPU system collects residential, commercial, and industrial wastewater and delivers it to interceptor lines operated by the regional sewage treatment agency (King County). The sewage is then treated at the West Point Sewage Treatment Plant before being discharged into Puget Sound. Two other plants, Alki and Carkeek, have been converted to treat wet weather overflows only. (See Utilities Figure A-5).

 Existing Capacity

 City Drainage and Wastewater System: The capacity of the wastewater system in some areas is limited when peak stormwater flows enter the combined systems. During or following intense or prolonged periods of rainfall, some of the systems cannot accommodate the combined runoff and sanitary sewage flows, resulting in combined sewer overflows (CSOs) being discharged into area waters. CSOs occur in both the regional and the City systems. Seattle's CSO Control Plan, adopted in 1988, and updated in 2001, addresses specific storage and separation projects to control CSOs and describes costs and schedules in a 20- year timeframe. SPU has already completed improvements to 69 of the 83 CSO locations and by the year 2006, Seattle will have reduced CSO volumes by at least 79 percent. Funding for these improvements is included in the Department's six-year CIP.

[Utilities Figure A-5 - METRO Facilities](/~ordpics/115137At13FigA-5.gif)

 Regional Wastewater Treatment System

 The West Point Treatment Plant is a secondary treatment facility, with a capacity of 133 million gallons per day (MGD), monthly average flow. It is designed to handle a peak flow capacity of 440 MGD, with 300 MGD receiving secondary treatment and the remainder primary treatment.

 The West Point Treatment Plant serves 1.3 million people including residents of Seattle, King County north of Seattle, and South Snohomish County.

 Anticipated Future Facilities

 City Facilities: Generally, the drainage and wastewater facilities in Seattle have been planned and sized to serve the maximum or build-out conditions under zoning at the time and will be adequate to serve the level of increased growth proposed in the Plan. The capacity of the wastewater system is limited in confined areas of the city, where there have been historic hydraulic and system backup problems. These problems are being addressed through developer-funded facility upgrades and by Seattle Public Utilities' CIP.

 Regional Facilities: Under King County's Regional Wastewater Services Plan, a third treatment plant is planned to be added in South Snohomish or North King County by about 2010 to handle the region's growth.

 Seattle Public Utilities (Solid Waste)

 SPU contracts with private firms for the collection of residential solid waste, recyclables, and yard waste and commercial solid waste within the city; collection of commercial recyclables is handled by the private sector, SPU provides for disposal of all solid waste generated within the city through a long-term contract with Waste Management Incorporated.

 Inventory

 The solid waste transfer system consists of four transfer stations. The two City-owned transfer stations receive residential and commercial solid waste, while the two privately-owned transfer stations receive both commercial and other solid waste from within and outside the city of Seattle. Refuse is compacted into containers which are trucked to the Argo Intermodal Facility; from there, the containers are loaded onto trains for long-haul transport to a landfill owned and operated by Waste Management Incorporated in Gilliam County, Oregon. Most recyclable materials are handled by two privately-owned facilities. The City of Seattle also owns and operates two household hazardous waste facilities. (See Utilities Figure A-6 for their location).

 Existing Capacity

 1. Solid Waste Collection and Transfer Facility Capacity:

 SPU's North and South Recycling and Disposal Stations (RDS) were designed in the 1960s for the transfer of solid waste, not for the current solid waste management strategy involving separation of recyclable materials. They were designed to handle 1,000 tons of solid waste per day (or 365,000 tons per year). In 2002, approximately 280,000 tons of solid waste were disposed of through the City's two transfer stations as well as more than 63,000 tons of yard waste, 2,000tons of wood waste, 600 tons of metal appliances and more than 32,000 tons of other recyclables, totaling about 349,000 tons per year.

 SPU is currently evaluating options for increasing the RDS's capacity to handle future self-haul and contractor trips and tons at the transfer stations as part of a comprehensive Solid Waste Facilities Master Plan that will be completed in 2003.

 A portion of the collected commercial solid waste generated in the City is delivered to the two privately-owned transfer stations. These two facilities handle refuse as well as construction and demolition debris and other wastes from both inside and outside Seattle. In 1999, the two private stations handled 225,000 tons of solid waste from the City of Seattle. In recent years, Waste Management Incorporated has also built a new station for separated construction debris. The two private transfer facilities have the capability to handle 300,000- 400,000 tons of waste per year including waste from Seattle's businesses. These facilities are located in the South Park area near the City's South Recycling and Disposal Station and south of downtown on South Lander Street.

 Intermodal container loading capacity at Argo Yard is limited and the demand to process other domestic and international cargo through this yard is expected to increase.

 2. Recycling Processing Facilities:

 Two private "material recovery facilities" (MRFs) serve as the processing and transfer facilities for most of the recyclable materials collected from in-City residents and businesses. These facilities are Recycle Seattle and Recycle America and they process and transfer a large proportion of the 320,000 tons of residential and commercial recyclable material that was collected through the City's solid waste system in 2000. Recycle America is located in the South Park area, near the City's South Recycling and Disposal Station, and Recycle Seattle is south of downtown on South Lander Street.

 3. Disposal Facilities:

 Waste is compacted at the transfer stations into containers that are trucked to the Argo rail yard and loaded onto a train for long-haul shipment to a landfill in Oregon. Presently, approximately 60 containers per day (each holding 25-28 tons), five days a week, are trucked to the railhead. The train to the landfill operates five times per week, with about 100 containers per trip. Waste containers from King, Snohomish, Island, San Juan, and Whatcom counties are also added to the train. Seattle and Washington Waste Systems (WWS) have a contract extending through March 31, 2028, and the terms of the contract are more than adequate to handle the additional waste volumes generated by projected growth.

 Anticipated Future Facilities

 The region's landfill capacity is large enough to last for at least the next 40-80 years. Private transfer stations have the capacity to handle projected solid waste tonnages, but SPU transfer facilities will need modifications if they are to adequately handle projected customer visits and to divert waste to effectively contribute to the City's waste reduction and recycling goals. Although the overall amount of waste generated in the city will increase with projected residential and employment growth, the percentage of waste that will be directed to disposal is expected to decrease because waste diversion through recycling is expected to increase. Seattle has adopted the goal of recycling 60 percent of its overall waste by 2008.

 Residential waste is anticipated to comprise a decreasing share of the future combined waste stream. Commercial waste is projected to comprise a larger share of Seattle's waste stream in the future. Increased commercial sector waste disposal needs and an increased demand for recycling contractor services will be handled by private contractors and facilities. Representatives from both private transfer stations have indicated that the increased amount of waste can be handled within the existing facilities.

 The two private materials processing facilities will handle a major share of the increase in volumes of recyclable material that will occur with projected growth. These businesses are dealing with services and markets at a regional level, so the specific impacts of increased Seattle tonnage are difficult to predict.

 It is anticipated that the two City-owned transfer stations will be demolished and rebuilt to accommodate projected customer demand and diversion goals.

 It is also anticipated that a new City-owned waste receiving and compaction station will be built in conjunction with an intermodal loading station. This intermodal solid waste transfer facility will eliminate the need to load containers at the existing Argo Yard.

 Utilities Appendix B:

 Description and Inventory of Investor-owned Utilities Serving Seattle

 Puget Sound Energy

 Puget Sound Energy (PSE) is an investor owned electric and natural gas utility serving more than 1.2 million customers in 11 Western Washington counties. In the Seattle area, PSE only provides natural gas service. PSE's distribution of natural gas involves system pressure regulation and the development and maintenance of a network of gas mains to serve the utility's customers.

 PSE is supplied by Northwest Pipeline Corporation, a natural gas wholesaler with interstate pipeline facilities extending from Canada to New Mexico. Two underground transmission lines branch off from the pipeline to serve more than 116,000 natural gas customers in the Seattle area.

 QWEST Communications

 QWEST Communications (QWEST) is the telephone company subsidiary of QWEST, Incorporated--one of the seven regional holding companies resulting from the divestiture of AT&T. QWEST is the principal provider of local telephone and related services in Seattle.

 Of the 11 central switching offices (COs) serving Seattle, 10 are located within the city limits. For local exchange, the COs switch calls in and between the line exchange groupings (these groupings are addressed uniquely by an area code and the first three digits of a phone number). For long distance, the COs switch calls and mediate between the long-distance network and the local originating/terminating network. Due to advances in technology, additional capacity is easily and quickly added to the system.

 Four main cable routes emanate from each CO, running north, south, east, and west. Connected to these main feeder routes are branch feeder routes which support thousands of local loops providing dial tone service to individual subscribers. The COs are connected by inter-exchange trunk lines that may be aerial or buried, and copper or fiber optic line.

 Cellular Communications

 Seattle is served numerous cellular telephone companies, the largest of which include AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Sprint PCS, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Cellular telephones are radios which send and receive signals from low-power, ultra-high frequency antennas positioned at several cellular communication ("cell") sites. The "cellular" name is derived from the manner in which coverage is provided by the cell sites. Each cell site has a signal radius, or coverage area, of only a few miles (depending upon terrain and capacity demand for service). As a cellular telephone user passes from one cell to the next, the call is transferred to an available channel at an adjacent cell site.

 The cellular phone industry is extremely volatile, so any comprehensive listing of providers or cell sites would be obsolete upon printing. There are over 500 cell sites within the city of Seattle. Ownership of the sites changes as companies enter and leave the market.

 Cable Television

 Two cable communications companies hold City franchises for serving Seattle residents, Comcast and Millennium Digital Media. (See Utilities Figure A-7.) The City is currently in the franchise renewal period with Comcast whose franchise expires on January 20, 2006. Millennium Digital Media's franchise expires on March 1, 2008.

 One of the primary components of a cable system is the head end site-- an electronic control center where the information signal is processed for distribution through the cable system. This signal can be received off a hard line (cable), a satellite dish, microwave antennae, and/or a TV antenna. Comcast has two primary head end sites in the Seattle area. It's cable system passes 264,744 Seattle homes and serves 139,445 households. Comcast has 2,311 Aerial plant miles and 412 Underground plant miles in Seattle (includes both fiber and coaxial cable). Millennium has one head end site in Seattle, along with 155 miles of coaxial cable and 3,240 miles of fiber optic cable serving 14,998 households out of 51, 463 homes passed.

 Seattle Steam

 Seattle Steam is a district heating utility franchised by the City. Its service area encompasses roughly a square-mile area of the Central Business District, extending from Blanchard Street to King Street and from the waterfront to 14th Avenue, crossing over First Hill. (See Utilities Figure A-8.) The company provides steam to commercial, residential, and institutional customers for space and hot water heating, along with other uses.

 Two steam-generating plants supply the network. The primary plant is located on Western Avenue at University Street. The secondary plant is located on Western Avenue near Yesler Way--the site of the original plant built in 1893. Total steam generation capacity is 750,000 pounds per hour, with boilers designed to burn either natural gas or residual oil. The network of insulated steel pipe encompasses a total length of over 18 miles beneath city streets and currently serves 220 customers.

 ATTACHMENT 14 Economic Development Appendix

 Economic Development Appendix A

 While the Growth Management Act does not require a comprehensive plan to include an economic development element, the King County Countywide Planning Policies do require that each jurisdiction in King County include in its comprehensive plan an economic development element which will include an estimate of the type and number of jobs to be accommodated in the jurisdiction during the next 20 years.

 Economic Development Figure A-1 presents the estimated number of jobs, by industry, Seattle expects to accommodate between 2002 and 2024. Total anticipated job growth for this period is estimated to be 93,000 jobs. This analysis is based on estimates of actual employment levels in 2002 and includes job growth for the two-year period prior to the 20-year window covered by this Plan.
