 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.28.040 to adjust wastewater rates; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.76.040 to adjust credits to low-income wastewater customers.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Section 21.28.040 Subsection B defines the wastewater volume rate to be the sum of the treatment rate, system rate, and, where applicable, the Master Metered Residential Development ("MMRD") surcharge; and

 WHEREAS, the treatment rate was last increased on January 1, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.28.040 Subsection B.1 requires that, for rates effective January 1, 2007 and thereafter, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") shall calculate annually a new treatment rate component of the wastewater volume rate; and

 WHEREAS, the treatment rate is based on the projected cost of treatment services provided by King County, divided by projected billed wastewater consumption, each as approved by the Seattle City Council, multiplied by an amount to cover costs of taxes and low income rate assistance; and

 WHEREAS, SPU's analysis of projected treatment costs and projected wastewater consumption billed to customers for 2007 shows that the existing treatment rate will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the associated treatment costs; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has determined that one of the components of the treatment rate calculation, the treatment multiplier, needs to be updated due to a change in the method of calculating the City Business and Occupation Tax; and

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers not billed directly by SPU for water or wastewater services are based on typical residential bills, and credits for such customers need to be revised to reflect changes in wastewater rates; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 21.28.040 B.1 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 21.28.040 Wastewater volume charge.

 * * *

 B. The wastewater volume rate shall be the sum of the treatment rate, system rate and MMRD surcharge, as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal services provided by King County ("treatment cost"). ~~Effective January 1, 2004, the treatment rate shall be $4.22 per CCF.~~ Effective January 1, 2005, the treatment rate shall be $4.72 per CCF. For rates effective January 1, 2007 and thereafter, Seattle Public Utilities shall calculate annually a new treatment rate. The new treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected treatment cost is divided by the projected billed wastewater consumption, each for the next calendar year ~~and each as specified in the most recent ordinance passed by City Council for the purpose of calculating the new treatment rate,~~ and (b) the result is multiplied by ~~one hundred and sixteen and one-half percent (116.5%)~~one hundred sixteen and seven-tenths percent (116.7%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which projected treatment cost may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the total treatment cost expected to be paid by Seattle Public Utilities in the current year and the total wastewater volume charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. No later than October 1 of each year, Seattle Public Utilities shall submit a written report of the proposed treatment rate for the following year and its effect on the total wastewater volume rate to the Chair of the Environment, Emergency Management and Utilities Committee. Such treatment rate~~Each new treatment rate calculated in accordance with this Subsection B.1~~ shall be effective ~~on each~~the following January 1 ~~, commencing January 1, 2007,~~ unless otherwise directed by ordinance.~~City Council in the most recent treatment rate ordinance.~~

 Section 2. Subsection 21.76.040 A.1 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 21.76.040 Utility low income rate assistance.

 A. Drainage, Wastewater, and Water. Persons qualified by the Human Services Department as eligible recipients of low income utility credits provided for in Section 21.76.010 (eligible recipients) shall be granted low income billing credits in the following amounts:

 1. Wastewater. Eligible recipients billed directly by Seattle Public Utilities for wastewater services and residing in single- family dwellings shall receive a credit equal to 0.5 times the  total current billing. Eligible recipients not billed directly by Seattle Public Utilities for wastewater services shall receive the following credits based on dwelling type:

 Effective Date Single-family and duplex Multifamily dwelling ~~January 1, 2003~~~~$16.58 per month~~~~$8.29 per month~~~~January 1, 2004~~~~$15.34 per month~~~~$10.62 per month~~ January 1, 2005 $17.12 per month $11.52 per month January 1, 2007$19.37 per month$13.41 per month

 At the time of a change to the wastewater volume charge described in SMC 21.28.040, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall calculate new credits based on dwelling type for eligible recipients not billed directly by Seattle Public Utilities. The credit for Single-family and duplex customers shall be 0.5 times the wastewater volume charge multiplied by 5.2 CCF, which is typical single family residential sewer billed consumption. The credit for Multifamily dwelling customers shall be 0.5 times the wastewater volume charge multiplied by 3.6 CCF, which is typical multifamily sewer billed consumption.
