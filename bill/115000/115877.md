 WHEREAS, RCW 82.80.020 was repealed in 2003 after the passage of Initiative Measure 776, and the need for a separate Vehicle License Fee Subfund no longer exists although minimal assets and fund balance remains in the Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, the monies remaining in the Arterial City Street Subfund and the Vehicle License Fee Subfund may now be used for the same purposes as those intended for the monies in the City Street Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, the Office Acquisition Fund (32100) was created in 1995 by Ordinance 117738 to receive bond proceeds to be used for the purchase of the Seattle Municipal (Key) Tower; and

 WHEREAS, the purpose for which the 2003 LTGO Joint Training Facility Subfund (34551) of the 2003 LTGO Project Fund was established is fulfilled, although minimal unexpended and unencumbered fund balance, assets and liabilities remain in the Subfund; and
