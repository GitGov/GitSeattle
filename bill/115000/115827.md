 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Fleets and Facilities Department Director to execute an amendment to a lease agreement with LHT Corporation, a Washington Corporation, for office space in the Pacific Building at 720 Third Avenue in Seattle.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117495 authorized execution of a lease agreement with LHT Corporation for office space in the Pacific Building at 720 Third Avenue; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119879 authorized an amendment to this lease agreement to adjust rentable square footage and extend the lease term in accordance with City needs; and

 WHEREAS, the lease has been amended three additional times to accommodate City business needs, and such amendments did not require legislative approval; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light currently occupies office space at the Pacific Building by mutual agreement with the landlord under the terms and conditions of this amended lease agreement, and anticipates a need for the same amount of leased office space for a minimum of three additional years in the downtown core; and

 WHEREAS, it is standard City practice for the Fleets and Facilities Department to procure leased office space on behalf of Seattle City Light, pay rent to the landlord for such leased space, and subsequently receive reimbursement from Seattle City Light; and

 WHEREAS, the amount of office space City Light needs to occupy in the downtown core cannot be accommodated within City-owned buildings during City Light's required timeframe; and

 WHEREAS, the Pacific Building is especially suitable to Seattle City Light office space needs because of the Building's proximity to City- owned buildings; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 3.18.240 requires City Council approval of the lease amendment because the total square footage leased for more than one calendar year will exceed 5,000 square feet; NOW, THEREFORE,

 6. Authority. The persons executing this Amendment No. 5 on behalf of the parties hereto represent and warrant that they have the authority to execute this Amendment No. 5 on behalf of said parties and that said parties have authority to enter into this Amendment No. 5.

 7. Option to Extend. Landlord hereby grants to Tenant the right, at its option, to extend the Term for one (1) period of three (3) years commencing November 1, 2009 and expiring October 31, 2012 (the "Extended Term") upon each and all of the following terms and conditions:

 (a) Tenant gives to Landlord, and Landlord actually receives, at least twelve (12) months (but not more than fifteen (15) months) prior to the Expiration Date a written notice (the "Notice of Exercise") of the exercise of the option to extend the Term, time being of the essence (i.e., the Notice of Exercise must be received by Landlord between August 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008. If the Notice of Exercise is not so given and received, then this option shall automatically expire and this Lease shall terminate on the Expiration Date (October 31, 2009).

 (b) Tenant is not in default, beyond applicable notice periods, under this Lease either at the time the Notice of Exercise is given and received or as of the date that the Extended Term would commence.

 (c) All of the terms and conditions of this Lease shall apply, except where specifically modified by this option.

 (d) The Minimum Monthly Rent payable during the option term shall be the Market Rate on the date the option term commences.

 (e) The term "Market Rate" shall mean the annual amount per rentable square foot that a willing, comparable renewal tenant would pay and a willing, comparable landlord of a similar office building would accept at arm's length for similar space, giving appropriate consideration to the following matters: (i) annual rental rates per rentable square foot; (ii) the type of escalation clauses (including, but without limitation, operating expense, real estate taxes, and CPI) and the extent of liability under the escalation clauses (i.e., whether determined on a "net lease" basis or by increases over a particular base year or base dollar amount); (iii) rent abatement provisions reflecting free rent and/or no rent during the lease term; (iv) length of lease term; (v) size and location of premises being leased; (vi) the amount of any tenant improvement or refurbishment allowances being provided by similar landlords to similar renewal tenants and (vii) other generally applicable terms and conditions of tenancy for similar space. The Market Rate may also designate periodic rental increases, a new Base Year and similar economic adjustments. The Market Rate shall be the Market Rate in effect as of the beginning of the option period, even though the determination may be made in advance of that date, and the parties may use recent trends in rental rates in determining the proper Market Rate as of the beginning of the option period.

 (f) If Tenant exercises the Extension Option, Landlord shall determine the Market Rate by using its good faith judgment. Landlord shall provide Tenant with written notice of such amount within thirty (30) days after Tenant exercises its Extension Option. Tenant shall have thirty (30) days ("Tenant's Review Period") after receipt of Landlord's notice of the new rental within which to accept such rental. In the event Tenant fails to accept in writing such rental proposal by Landlord, then such proposal shall be deemed rejected, and Landlord and Tenant shall attempt to agree upon such Market Rate, using their best good faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within thirty (30) days following Tenant's Review Period ("Outside Agreement Date"), then each party shall place in a separate sealed envelope their final proposal as to the Market Rate, and such determination shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with subsections (i) through (v) below. In the event that Landlord fails to timely generate the initial notice of Landlord's opinion of the Market Rate, then Tenant may commence such negotiations by providing the initial notice, in which event Landlord shall have fifteen (15) days ("Landlord's Review Period") after receipt of Tenant's notice of the new rental within which to accept such rental. In the event Landlord fails to accept in writing such rental proposed by Tenant, then such proposal shall be deemed rejected, and Landlord and Tenant shall attempt in good faith to agree upon such Market Rate, using their best good faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within thirty (30) days following Landlord's Review Period (which shall be, in such event, the "Outside Agreement Date" in lieu of the above definition of such date), then each party shall place in a separate sealed envelope their final proposal as to Market Rate, and such determination shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with subsections (i) through (v) below.

 Arbitration of Disputes

 (i) A representative of Landlord and a representative of Tenant shall meet with each other within five (5) business days after the Outside Agreement Date and exchange their sealed envelopes and then open such envelopes in each other's presence. If Landlord and Tenant do not mutually agree upon the market rate within one (1) business day of the exchange and opening of envelopes, then, within ten (10) business days of the exchange and opening of envelopes, Landlord and Tenant shall agree upon and jointly appoint a single arbitrator who shall by profession be a real estate broker or agent who shall have been active over the five (5) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of commercial office buildings similar to the Premises in the geographical area of the Premises. Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall consult with such broker or agent as to his or her opinion as to the market rate prior to the appointment. The determination of the arbitrator shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Market Rate for the premises is the closest to the actual Market Rate for the Premises as determined by the arbitrator, taking into account the requirements for determining Market Rate set forth herein. Such arbitrator may hold such hearings and require such briefs as the arbitrator, in his or her sole discretion, determines is necessary. In addition, Landlord or Tenant may submit to the arbitrator with a copy to the other party within five (5) business days after the appointment of the arbitrator any market data and additional information such party deems relevant to the determination of the market rate ("RR Data"), and the other party may submit a reply in writing within five (5) business days after receipt of such RR Data.

 (ii) The arbitrator shall, within thirty (30) days of his or her appointment, reach a decision as to whether the parties shall use Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Market Rate and shall notify Landlord and Tenant of such determination.

 (iii) The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant.

 (iv) If Landlord and Tenant fail to agree upon and appoint an arbitrator, then the appointment of the arbitrator shall be made by the presiding judge of the any court having jurisdiction over the parties.

 (v) The cost of the arbitration shall be paid by Landlord and Tenant equally.

 8. Counterparts. This Amendment No. 5 may be executed in counterparts. Each counterpart shall be deemed an original, and all counterparts shall be deemed the same instrument with the same effect as if all parties hereto had signed the same signature page.
