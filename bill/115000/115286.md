 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; establishing a voluntary Green-Up Program and amending Section 21.49 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, RCW Chapter 19.29A requires that electric utilities offer retail electricity customers a voluntary option to purchase qualified alternative energy resources; and

 WHEREAS, City Light's existing voluntary Green Power Program was designed to fund the development of smaller-scale, local, or regional renewable energy projects not included in City Light's power portfolio, with the goals of creating awareness, improving operating experience, and creating market demand through technology demonstrations and education; and

 WHEREAS, City Light's existing voluntary Green Power Program was not designed to provide customers with a green power product as a percentage of their electricity use from larger-scale wind and other commercially available renewable energy resources as offered by other utilities; and

 WHEREAS, a growing number of City Light customers have requested such a product, and offering a Green-Up Program will increase participation and support for new renewable resources in the Northwest; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 21.49 is amended to add a new section, SMC 21.49.084, to read as follows:

 21.49.084 Voluntary Green Power, Green-Up Program

 The Department shall offer a Voluntary Green Power, Green-Up Program, in accordance with RCW Chapter 19.29A.

 A. The Green-Up Program shall be voluntary and shall be available to all customers beginning July 1, 2005. Customers may voluntarily begin or terminate their participation at any time on or after July 1, 2005 by notifying the Department of their choice.

 B. The Green-Up Program shall allow each customer to designate a voluntary green power payment level which, at the customer's discretion, may be added to the customer's monthly or bimonthly electricity bill or paid one time in full.

 C. The voluntary Green-up Program payments, less the costs of administering the program ("Net Green-up Revenue"), will be used to purchase qualified alternative energy resources including renewable resources from Northwest wind, biomass, and landfill gas projects. Subject to the provisions of the ordinances authorizing issuance of the City's municipal light and power revenue obligations, the Department shall make available from its budgeted funds, for the purchase or development of new qualified alternative energy resources, an amount equal to the Net Green-up Revenue allocated to existing Department qualified alternative energy resources.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
