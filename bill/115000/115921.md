 (i) receipt of a complaint, demand letter, claim or other notice that a lawsuit has been or will be commenced involving the Museum (regardless of the propriety of any service of process on the Museum) where the amount in controversy (either as stated by the claimant or, for so long as no amount is stated by the claimant, an amount reasonably estimated by the Museum to be at risk), when added to the amounts in controversy (as described above) in all matters pending or threatened as described in this paragraph, against the Museum, exceeds the limits of the Museum's primary insurance coverage (regardless of whether the Museum tenders or intends to tender the matter to its primary insurer);

However, if the Museum does not agree that the City Finance Director should add the preliminary assessment amount to the previously determined amount of Finance Director Determined Liability, the City Finance Director shall select outside counsel to assist the City Finance Director in further analyzing the risk of loss and in making a judgment as to the amount of such potential liability.

Section6.1Authority and Museum Defaults; Notice and Opportunity to Cure.

 (a) Events of Default. Each of the following shall be an Event of Default and, except as provided in ~~subsection~~>>subsections (b) and (c), notice of such event shall constitute a Declaration of Default:

 (1) The City has made any advance to the Bond Trustee pursuant to its receipt of a Reserve Deficiency Notice and has not, within 20 days of the date that such advance was made, either: (1) been reimbursed in full, or (2) received a Reimbursement Schedule that is acceptable to the City; or

 (2) The Authority and the Museum both fail to pay or cause to be paid amounts required to reimburse the City under a Reimbursement Schedule accepted by the City; or

 (3) Either the Authority or the Museum fails to perform or observe any of its other obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, including but not limited to: the failure to give any notice required under Section 4.2(c)(3) of this Agreement, and the failure to repay any amounts that have been previously paid to the City but are recovered, attached or enjoined pursuant to any insolvency, receivership, liquidation or similar proceedings; or

 (4) The MDA or the Museum fails to perform one or more of its obligations under any Security Document, the MDA Lease, the Office Space Lease, the Lockbox Addendum, the Indenture or the Bond Resolution; or

 (5) Any representation or warranty of the Authority or the Museum is determined by the City Finance Director to have been materially false when made or as of the Acquisition Date.

 (6) Five business days prior to the expiration or termination date of any property or liability insurance policy, the City has not received Evidence of Insurance and/or Binders (as required by Exhibit I) and the broker opinion letter required by Exhibit I all demonstrating to the City Finance Director's reasonable satisfaction that the renewal/replacement policy complies with all requirements of Exhibit I.

 (7) Issuance of (i) notice of cancellation of any insurance required by Exhibit I, or (ii) notice of any change to an insurance policy submitted under the insurance covenant in Section 5.4, that: (A) reduces coverage limits below those required under Exhibit I; (B) reduces or eliminates the earthquake insurance or the terrorism insurance below what is required by Exhibit I; or (C) removes any of the following statuses with respect to any of the City, the Bond Trustee, or the Lockbox Agent: (1) additional insured, (2) loss payee, or (3) mortgagee, including provision(s) providing for waivers of subrogation benefiting the City, the Bond Trustee, and the Lockbox Agent.

 (8) Any other breach of any insurance covenant in Section 5.4 or in Exhibit I.

 (b) Notice of Default; Opportunity to Cure; Declaration of Default. Notice of an Event of Default under paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) shall not constitute a Declaration of Default until the City Finance Director has issued a notice stating that such notice is a "Declaration of Default." The City Finance Director shall issue a Declaration of Default under this subsection (b) only after:

 (1) The City Finance Director shall give notice to the Authority, the Museum, the Lockbox Agent and the Bond Trustee of such default specifying the same and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default"; and

 (2) Thirty days have elapsed since the giving of such notice to correct the default and the event, condition or circumstance giving rise to the default has not been corrected. However, if the default stated in the notice is of such a nature that it cannot be completely remedied within the 30 days, the City Finance Director shall not issue a Declaration of Default hereunder so long as: (i) the applicable party institutes corrective action within 30 days and diligently pursues such action until the default is corrected (which shall extend to no more than 120 days after the date of the Notice of Default, unless an extension is obtained from the City Finance Director); and (ii) in the opinion of Bond Counsel, the failure to cure said default within 30 days will not adversely affect the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Bonds.

 (c) Insurance Defaults; Opportunity to Cure. Each event described under paragraphs (6) through (8) of subsection (a) shall be an Event of Default from the time of its occurrence, and upon expiration of the applicable cure period as described in this section, shall constitute a Declaration of Default without the necessity of any notice of default or Declaration of Default being sent by the City. If any notice by the City is required under subsection (d), this requirement shall not affect the timing of an Event of Default or Declaration of Default under this section. The following cure periods shall apply from the occurrence of the default:

 (1) An insurance default under Section 6.1(a)(6) shall have a cure period that expires on the last business day prior to the expiration or termination date of the applicable property or liability insurance policy, but if the default does not relate to coverage types and levels, and instead relates only to the form of the policy or the manner in which the parties' insured interests are identified, then the parties agree that the cure period will be extended (not to exceed 30 calendar days) to allow for completion of arbitration before an independent arbitrator as described in Exhibit K.

 (2) An insurance default under Section 6.1(a)(7) shall have a cure period that expires at the effective date and time of the reduction, cancellation or change identified in the notice.

 (3) An insurance default under Section 6.1(a)(8) shall have a 30 calendar day cure period.

 All cure periods described in this subsection (c) shall run from the date of the occurrence of the Event of Default, and the cure periods (and extensions thereof) under Section 6.1(b) shall be inapplicable.

 (d) If the City Finance Director determines that an insurance default under Section 6.1(a)(6), (7), or (8) has occurred, and the City Finance Director intends to pay an unpaid premium or obtain replacement insurance, the City Finance Director shall provide to the Authority, the Museum, the Lockbox Agent and the Bond Trustee notice of his intent at least one business day prior to taking such action. This notice shall not extend or otherwise affect the cure periods set forth in Section 6.1(c), which shall run from the occurrence of the Event of Default and not from the date of the notice. Failure or deficiency in the giving or receiving of notice under this paragraph shall not in any way affect the City's rights and available remedies under this Guarantee Agreement and the Security Documents, and shall not affect the City's right to exercise those remedies at the expiration of the cure periods described in Section 6.1(c).

Section6.2Rights and Remedies of City on Authority or Museum Default.

 (a) Remedies Available. Upon a Declaration of Default~~under~~>> (including at the expiration of a cure period described in Section 6.1(c the City at its sole option may take any one or more of the following steps:

 (1) The City may take whatever action at law or in equity may appear necessary or desirable to collect the payments required to be made by the Authority and the Museum under this Agreement and the Security Documents, or to enforce performance and observance of any obligation or agreement of the Authority under the Security Documents.

 (2) The City may proceed to protect and enforce its rights in equity or at law, either in mandamus or for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein (including without limitation the enforcement of the requirement that notice of extraordinary redemption be sent), or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy, as the City may deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of its rights or interests under this Agreement and the Security Documents.

 (3) If, and only if, the Bonds are no longer outstanding, then in the case of an Event of Default resulting from the failure of both the Authority and the Museum to fulfill their reimbursement obligations under this Agreement, the City may declare the entire principal balance of the advance (if not then due and payable) to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the principal of the advance shall become and be immediately due and payable, together with all interest accrued thereon to the date of such acceleration, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.

 (b) Additional Insurance Default Remedies. In the event of a default described in Section 6.1(a)(6), (7), or (8), on the last business day of the applicable cure period under Section 6.1(c), the City, in the City Finance Director's sole discretion and without waiving any other remedies, may:

 (1) (i) pay any unpaid premium; or (ii) procure or provide such insurance as the City Finance Director in his sole discretion deems necessary to protect the City's interest (including insurance protecting the interests of the Bond Trustee and Lockbox Agent under this Agreement), not to exceed the requirements of Exhibit I. In so doing, the City may act at the City Finance Director's absolute sole discretion as to the insurance carrier(s) selected, the cost paid, the terms of the policy(ies) chosen, and coverages (not to exceed the requirements of Exhibit I), and shall be under no obligation to act in a commercially reasonable manner.

 (2) During the period beginning on the fifth business day prior to the end of the applicable cure period, if the City Finance Director has a reasonable basis to conclude, based on the information available to him, that the default will not be cured, the City may proceed to arrange for replacement insurance to be placed effective no earlier than the final day of the cure period, and the Authority and the Museum shall be jointly and severally obligated to reimburse the City for any costs incurred, including interest computed in accordance with Section 3.2(b).

 (3) Any policy placed by the City under this Section 6.2(b) shall remain in effect until the City Finance Director has been satisfied that the Authority or the Museum has caused other insurance to be obtained that meets the requirements of Exhibit I, and shall be subject to cancellation (and refund of unearned premium) to permit the Authority or the Museum to place (or cause placement of) replacement insurance. To carry out the foregoing, within 5 business days after the City Finance Director's receipt of binders and/or evidence of insurance (as applicable) submitted by the Authority or the Museum in order to demonstrate that such replacement insurance is in compliance with Exhibit I: (i) if the City Finance Director is satisfied that the Exhibit I requirements have been met, the City shall give any required notice of cancellation of the City-placed insurance; or (ii) if the City Finance Director is not satisfied that the Exhibit I requirements have been met, the City shall invoke the arbitration procedure described in Section 6.1(c)(1). If and to the extent that any reimbursement of premium to the City (from its insurance company) causes the City to have recovered in total more than the costs it incurred arising from an Event of Default under Section 6.1(a)(6), (7), or (8), the excess shall be returned to the Authority or the Museum (or credited against any amount due from the Authority or the Museum) after the City has been made whole.

 (c) Reimbursement of Insurance Payments. The following provisions shall govern reimbursement of the City's costs incurred in connection with the placement or procurement of replacement insurance by the City pursuant to Section 6.1(d):

 (1) The Authority and the Museum each jointly and severally agree to reimburse the City, within 5 business days after demand, for any insurance premium paid by the City hereunder (whether force-placed or otherwise) and all costs, including without limitation, any insurance premium(s), interest on such premium payment(s) and any other costs or fees the City may incur in obtaining the insurance. City costs incurred during the period described in Section 6.2(b)(2) are recoverable even if the Authority or the Museum cures the default. The obligations of the Authority and the Museum to reimburse the City under paragraph (1) of this subsection is secured by the Security Documents. This reimbursement obligation is not governed by the provisions under Section 3.2 for reimbursement of advances made to the Bond Trustee (except as reference may be made to Section 3.2(b) for calculation of appropriate interest rates on reimbursement obligations). Notice of the demand shall be sent by the City to the Authority, the Museum, the Lockbox Agent and the Bond Trustee.

 (2) If the Museum and the Authority fail to reimburse the City in full within 5 business days after demand, the City Finance Director may deliver notice to the Lockbox Agent (with copies to the Bond Trustee, the Authority and the Museum) that the Authority and the Museum have failed to reimburse City for such insurance payments, and the Lockbox Agent shall act in accordance with Section 4.1(b).

 In addition to receiving the excess funds from the Bond Trustee and Lockbox Agent, the City may also pursue any and all other remedies available to it to recover reimbursement for any and all costs, including without limitation, any insurance premium(s), interest on such premium payment(s) and any other costs or fees the City may incur in obtaining replacement insurance.

 (d) Effect of Waiver in Accordance with City Ordinance. The City (through the City Finance Director or by Council ordinance, as applicable, in accordance with the City Ordinance) may waive any Authority or Museum default and may rescind a Declaration of Default and its consequences; but no such waiver, rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Authority or Museum default or impair any right incident thereto.

 Exhibit F

Project Description

The Project consists of the acquisition, equipping and furnishing of a condominium (the "MDA Unit") and related improvements to the existing downtown art museum to accommodate the expansion of the existing downtown art museum. The condominium is being constructed as part of a joint development by a limited liability company of which the MDA, the Museum and WAMU are members. The development is on the east side of the block bounded by First and Second Avenues and University and Union Streets in downtown Seattle.

 Upon completion, the MDA will acquire the MDA Unit for lease to the Museum for museum expansion space. The MDA Unit will consist of four floors of new construction, totaling approximately 118,000 square feet, roughly doubling the size of the downtown museum space when combined with the existing downtown art museum facility designed by Venturi, Scott, Brown & Associates. Other condominiums in the development will be acquired by the Museum for future museum expansion (to be leased to WAMU in the interim period pursuant to a long-term lease) and by WAMU for its world headquarters. The MDA Unit is scheduled to be completed for acquisition in February, 2006, and the expanded museum is expected to open in 2007.

 (d) Notice. Notice to the City required under this Exhibit I shall be given as specified in Article 7, Section 7.2 ("Notices").

 Exhibit K

 Procedures for Insurance Arbitration under Section 6.1(c)(1)

The following arbitration procedure is available only as described in section6.1(c)(1) and only if the default does not relate to coverage types and levels, and instead relates only to the form of the policy or the manner in which the parties' insured interests are identified. Cure periods and remedies shall be governed by Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the Agreement.

 1. On or before the last business day prior to the expiration or termination date of the applicable property or liability insurance policy, the Museum or the Authority may call for arbitration by providing notice to the City Finance Director. A call for arbitration shall extend the cure period until 3 business days after the arbitrator issues a written determination, but in no event beyond 30 calendar days after the expiration or termination date of the policy. The arbitration shall be limited to the issue of whether the form of the policy and the manner in which the parties' insured interests are identified therein satisfies the requirements set forth in Exhibit I. Regardless of who prevails, the City shall pay half the cost of the compensation for the arbitrator and the Authority and the Museum shall together pay the other half.

Within two business days following the giving of notice calling for arbitration, the Authority or the Museum shall deliver to the City: (A) a package including all materials the Museum and the Authority deem necessary to demonstrate that it has cured the default (the "Museum Materials"); and (B) a list of 3 independent arbitrators acceptable to the Authority and the Museum, who shall have substantial experience in insurance claims handling and/or underwriting, and shall be a practicing or retired commercial insurance broker, attorney, judge or risk manager. The Museum or the Authority shall confirm prior to submission of its list that each proposed arbitrator is available to hear the dispute and make a determination in the timeframe set forth in this Exhibit K.

 3. No later than 3 business days following the City Finance Director's receipt of the Museum Materials, the City shall provide to the Authority and the Museum a written response and any other materials the City Finance Director deems necessary to explain why it believes that the requirements of Exhibit I have not been met (the "City Materials"). At the same time, the City Finance Director shall either identify an acceptable arbitrator from the list provided or provide with its response a list of 3 independent arbitrators acceptable to the City Finance Director who possess the above- identified qualifications and are confirmed as available to hear the dispute and make a determination in the timeframe set forth in this Exhibit K. If the City does not choose an arbitrator from the list provided by the Authority and the Museum, then within one business day after the City provides its list to the Museum and the Authority, the City Finance Director and one representative acting on behalf of both the Authority and the Museum shall confer and, if no arbitrator can be agreed upon, the parties' representatives shall flip a coin, and the coin toss winner shall choose from the coin toss loser's list.

 4. Immediately upon selection of an arbitrator, that arbitrator shall be contacted by the party that first identified that person as a potential arbitrator. The arbitrator shall hold a hearing within 5 business days of being chosen, at which hearing each side a) the City and (b) the Museum and the Authority) shall present its position based on the previously-submitted City Materials and Museum Materials (together, the "Materials"). No additional written materials shall be submitted, no discovery shall be conducted and the formal rules of evidence shall not apply. The arbitrator shall determine such rules of procedure, if any, as are necessary for the conduct of the hearing. The arbitrator shall consider the Materials and the positions as presented at the hearing and shall provide a written determination within 3 business days after the hearing, but in no event more than 25 calendar days after the date of the original notice calling for arbitration. The arbitrator's determination shall state whether the Materials demonstrate that the form of the policy and the manner in which the parties' insured interests are named satisfies the requirements of Exhibit I.

 5. If the arbitrator concludes that the that the form of the policy or the manner in which the parties' insured interests are named in the Museum Materials satisfies the requirements of Exhibit I, then the default shall be deemed cured.

 6. If the arbitrator concludes that the form of the policy or the manner in which the parties' insured interests are named in the Museum Materials does not satisfy the requirements of Exhibit I, then the arbitrator shall provide a brief explanation as to his or her conclusion.
