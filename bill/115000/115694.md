~~This project provides for a preliminary study and creation of a design plan to upgrade the existing facilities at Cedar Falls Headquarters. The existing buildings, which were constructed from the 1920s to 1950s, do not meet building codes or the requirements of current staff, and are in a deteriorated condition that requires constant major repairs. Several of the buildings were constructed for residential occupation and are not well suited to business needs. The study and plan for construction of new facilities addresses ongoing maintenance issues in the current facilities including toxic mold, lack of handicapped access, and rodent infestations, and includes replacing or rebuilding stairs at building entrances. In the 2005-2010 Adopted CIP, the project ID for this project was C1NW101-005.~~

This project provides for a preliminary study and creation of a design plan to improve the existing facilities at Cedar Falls, Tolt, Landsburg and Lake Youngs. The Facilities are aging and deteriorating, building utility systems are inadequate for current use, some of the structures were built for entirely different purposes and there are existing health, safety and regulatory issues that need to be addressed in specific structures. At Cedar Falls, the existing buildings, which were constructed from the 1920s to 1950s, do not meet building codes or business needs, and are in a deteriorated condition that requires constant major repairs. As an example, several of the buildings were constructed for residential occupation and are not well suited for operational business needs. This project will assess the watersheds and transmission facilities, identify the most critical facility problems, develop a master plan for facilities that meets our short term business needs for today and our long term business needs for the future. In the 2005-2010 Adopted CIP, the ID for this project was C1NW101-005.
