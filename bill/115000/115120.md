 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to appeals of contracting decisions; ending the practice of having the Office of the Hearing Examiner provide advisory opinions on public works and purchasing bid appeals; and repealing Section 3.04.095 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, the City abrogated its Contracting Appeals Board (CAB) in 1996 and the duties associated with CAB contract appeals were assigned in part to the Hearing Examiner; and,

 WHEREAS, the Office of the Hearing Examiner provides only an advisory recommendation to the Director of Executive Administration; and,

 WHEREAS, because the Office of the Hearing Examiner receives few appeals, it has limited ability to retain subject matter expertise in the complicated and evolving area of contract and bidding law; and,

 WHEREAS, the Hearing Examiner process can add a delay of weeks to a contracting process, which is adverse to the City's legal and financial interests without corresponding benefits to either the City or to bidders; and,

 WHEREAS, other jurisdictions in Washington, including King County, University of Washington, and other state agencies, do not have an "administrative law judge" review and issue advisory opinions on the decisions made by their contracting experts, but instead have an internal agency appeal process that successfully resolves the majority of bidder concerns through less formal means; and,

 WHEREAS, the Office of the Hearing Examiner allocates resources weekly to promptly hear contracting appeals that have not been forthcoming and this reservation of resources is inefficient; and,

 WHEREAS, the City's contracting and purchasing staff, as the subject matter experts, are adept at handling these issues and can and do resolve most concerns informally, while still affording the contractors the opportunity to seek recourse in the courts; and,

 WHEREAS, the Copernicus project recommended that the Department of Executive Administration eliminate administratively burdensome processes where these practices are without significant benefit, are outdated, or whose costs are disproportionate to any value they may have; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 3.04.095 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ord. 120794, is repealed in its entirety.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2004, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2004.
