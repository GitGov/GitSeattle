 AN ORDINANCE relating to the development of a Surface plus Transit Plan (Surface/Transit Plan) to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct on the central waterfront; providing principles to guide development of the Surface/Transit Plan; directing the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) to take certain actions with respect to developing and implementing this Plan; recommending that SDOT and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) take certain traffic-mitigation measures in connection with this Plan; lifting a budget proviso restricting the use of funds; and reducing and reappropriating with limitations certain appropriations in the 2007 Budget.

 WHEREAS, the replacement of the Viaduct is a decision that will impact the City of Seattle ("City") for up to 100 years and will profoundly affect the region's transportation network and the future enjoyment of the waterfront by residents of Seattle and the region; and

 WHEREAS, building another double-decker aerial highway on the central waterfront is not desirable as it would continue pollution, noise and shadowing, all of which degrade the public enjoyment of the waterfront; and

 WHEREAS, in September 2006 the City Council adopted Ordinance 122246 explicitly rejecting a new elevated structure to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct and declaring the tunnel as the City's preferred alternative for the project; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122246 also stated that should the Tunnel Alternative become infeasible, the City recommended the development of a surface street and transit alternative that met the intent of Resolutions 30664 and 30724; and

 WHEREAS, the City also rejected a new elevated structure to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct through Ordinance 122247; and

 WHEREAS, in January 2007 the City Council adopted Resolution 30960, reaffirming its explicit rejection of a new elevated structure in adopted Ordinance 122246, and reaffirming its findings and declarations in Ordinance 122247 that a new elevated structure would be contrary to the goals and objectives of the Waterfront Concept Plan, and to adopted City policies, including Comprehensive Plan policies approved pursuant to the State Growth Management Act, the State adopted Seattle Shoreline Master Program, and related implementing regulations; and

 WHEREAS, the goals of the City, the City's Comprehensive Plan, and the Seattle Transit Plan include reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and call for a shift away from the use of single occupant vehicles and toward transit alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 30960 the City also declared its intent to work in partnership with King County and the State of Washington to develop a fiscally responsible alternative for replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct that conforms to the City's Comprehensive Plan policies, the Seattle Shoreline Master Plan, and related implementing regulations; and

 WHEREAS, the Governor requested that the City of Seattle hold an election asking the voters to express their preference on replacement options for the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and

 WHERAS, in response to that request, the City Council voted on January 19th, 2007 to place two advisory measures on the March 13th, 2007 ballot asking voters their preference regarding two alternatives (the "Surface/Tunnel Hybrid Alternative" and the "Elevated Structure Alternative") for replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and

 WHEREAS, at the March 13th, 2007 ballot, the Seattle voters rejected both the Surface/Tunnel Hybrid Alternative and the Elevated Structure Alternative to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and

 WHEREAS, with Ordinance 122246, Council intended when declaring the tunnel as the preferred alternative that should the tunnel option prove infeasible, the Council would direct the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) to begin work as soon as was practicable on a new Surface plus Transit Plan (Surface/Transit Plan), consisting generally of surface improvements to the Alaskan Way corridor and enhanced transit services, instead of a new grade-separated highway along the central waterfront;

 WHEREAS, with the Governor's declaration that the Surface/Tunnel Hybrid Alternative is not safe and the no vote on the Surface/Tunnel Hybrid Alternative, that alternative clearly lacks political and popular support such that that option has now become infeasible; and

 WHEREAS, the surface alternative analyzed by WSDOT in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is inadequate, and among other things did not anticipate significant changes in available bus service or assess what other kinds of enhanced transit are available; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Statement of Policy: The City Council declares the need to rethink options for addressing capacity and mobility on the State Route 99 corridor, and to move toward a consensus solution for the replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct along the central waterfront, placing priority on mobility (the movement of people and goods) over motor-vehicle capacity. The City Council intends to direct 2007 funds appropriated to the Viaduct project toward development of a Surface/Transit Plan to increase mobility along the Highway 99 corridor and to and through downtown.

 Section 2. Development of Surface/Transit Plan: The City Council directs SDOT to develop a Surface/Transit Plan for replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct. The Surface/Transit Plan is to consist of surface-street improvements to the Alaskan Way corridor along the central waterfront, strategic and significant investments in transit and other traffic-management techniques to enhance mobility for people and goods, and incorporate the principles set out in Section 3 of this Ordinance.

 Section 3. Guiding Principles for the Surface/Transit Plan: The City Council provides the following principles to guide the development of the Surface/Transit Plan for the replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and directs SDOT to consider these principles and incorporate them into the Plan:

 a) Enhance Mobility Rather Than Motor-Vehicle Capacity - Prioritize mobility (the movement of people and goods) over motor-vehicle capacity, and consider transportation demand strategies such as congestion pricing and regional tolling to achieve this goal;

 b) Prioritize Freight and Commercial Traffic - Accommodate freight and commercial traffic movement, and evaluate providing priority access at certain times of day;

 c) Look Beyond Waterfront for Expanded Capacity - Look broadly for opportunities to enhance mobility to expand capacity, including improved regional transit service, increased opportunities for alternative forms of transportation, limiting parking on downtown streets during rush hour and creating dedicated bus lanes through downtown;

 d) Avoid Diverting Traffic onto I-5 - Provide sufficient options to minimize diversion of vehicle traffic from Highway 99 onto Interstate-5;

 e) Maximize Public Open Space on the Waterfront and Create a Pedestrian-Friendly Environment - Design the central waterfront to be friendly to pedestrians through maximizing the amount of open space and incorporating measures to increase pedestrian safety, such as providing on-street parking along Alaskan Way on the central waterfront during non-peak hours to serve as a buffer between pedestrians and vehicles;

 f) Bicycle access--Include facilities to accommodate bicyclists and increase bicycling as a safe and convenient mode of transportation;

 g) Improve the Overall Environment - Use the Surface/Transit Plan as an opportunity to enhance all aspects of the neighboring environment, including air, noise, water quality and near shore habitat;

 h) Maintain the Health of Downtown Businesses -Provide sufficient mitigation for the impacts of construction to maintain the health of downtown businesses;

 i) Consider a Phased Approach to Project Implementation- Consider a phased approach to the implementation of the new transit options, the removal of the existing Viaduct and the construction of a new surface street, all with the goal of minimizing traffic impacts and reducing the disruption of businesses on the central waterfront, downtown, and businesses impacted by the proposed construction on Highway 99;

 j) Incorporate Previously-Adopted Principles - Incorporate the principles set forth in Resolution 30664 concerning development of a Central Waterfront Plan and Resolution 30724 concerning the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Project; and

 k) Identify and Develop All Potential Funding Sources - Determine the most effective ways to move people and goods through multiple modes and then determine what changes are necessary in federal, state and local funding in order to develop and build the Surface/Transit Plan. Do not permit existing constraints on funding sources to drive decisions.

 Section 4. Proposed Scope of Work within 30 Days: The City Council directs SDOT to report back to Council within 30 days of the effective date of this ordinance with a written report including a proposed scope of work for Council review and possible approval. This scope of work will detail how the Surface/Transit Plan will be developed, the timeline for development, and an assessment of the resources needed to complete the Surface/Transit Plan. The proposed scope of work also will address what analyses will be needed to assess options for increased transit, how SDOT plans to work with local and regional transit agencies on the Surface/Transit Plan, what additional environmental review will be needed for the Surface/Transit Plan, and how SDOT plans to incorporate work done to date that is relevant to the Surface/Transit Plan, including the work of King County.

 Section 5. Involvement of Other Agencies: In order to fully explore options that increase mobility by improving transit services, the City Council directs SDOT to invite transit agencies to join the City and WSDOT in developing the Surface/Transit Plan to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct. These agencies should include King County Metro, Sound Transit, Community Transit, the Port of Seattle, and Washington State Ferries. The City, along with WSDOT and these transit agencies, should also convene meetings with the Governor, state Legislators, the Port of Seattle, and key stakeholders to determine the best course of action to proceed with the development and identification of funding sources for a Surface/Transit Plan. The City will utilize the expertise of the project partners and those key stakeholders through the formation of a new mobility partnership, which is tasked to help guide the City's efforts in development of the Surface/Transit Plan.

 Section 6. Related Mitigation Measures: The Council directs SDOT, in connection with developing and implementing the Surface/Transit Plan, to work with WSDOT to proceed as soon as practicable on mitigation measures designed to improve mobility before, during, and after Viaduct replacement construction. These mitigation measures include:

 - Improvements to segments of State Route 99 south of downtown between Holgate Street and King Street;

 - Completion of the SR 519 project;

 - Construction of a new rail crossing at Lander Street;

 - Repairs and Improvements for the Spokane Street Viaduct, including renovating the existing Spokane Street Viaduct and adding a new connection from the Spokane Street Viaduct to Fourth Avenue South to better connect with downtown;

 - Expansion of existing transit service, including the West Seattle water taxi, to achieve a higher mode split for transit;

 - Investments in the capital improvements needed to facilitate transit movement to and through downtown, including improvements identified by King County (the "49 Little Things");

 - Develop and fully implement Bus Rapid Transit (King County's Rapid Ride) in the region as expeditiously as possible;

 - Making improvements to the Mercer Corridor to facilitate traffic flow to and from I-5; and

 - Making any repairs and/or renovations needed to safely operate and maintain the central waterfront section of the Alaskan Way Viaduct until a replacement facility is identified.

 Section 7. Budget Proviso Restriction Lifted: The restriction imposed by the following budget proviso is removed and there are no longer restrictions related to this proviso for any purpose including for Subsection 1 (b) of Ordinance 122298:
