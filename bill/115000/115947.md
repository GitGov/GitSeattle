 WHEREAS, Millennium informed the City on or about August 2, 2006, that the sale to Wave Broadband had been cancelled and would not close (see Exhibit A), thereby voiding Ordinance 122179; and

 WHEREAS, Millennium subsequently secured financing through a series of transactions that affected the capital structure and equity ownership of Millennium's parent company, Millennium Digital Media Holdings, L.L.C. ("MDM Holdings"); and

 WHEREAS, the City maintains that Millennium's actions to restructure its financing constitutes a "transfer of control" under Millennium's Franchises; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 14 of the Franchises and SMC 21.60.520, cable franchises may not be transferred without prior consent of the City; and

 WHEREAS, the City maintains that Millennium effectively transferred control of the Franchises on or about October 26, 2006, and Millennium is therefore in violation of its Franchises for not obtaining prior consent from the City; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 19.2 of the Franchises, the City maintains that it has a right to assess liquidated damages against Millennium for Millennium's failure to obtain prior transfer approval required by Section 14 of the Franchises and SMC 21.60.520, among other available remedies; and

 WHEREAS, in lieu of liquidated damages, the City and Millennium have agreed to enter into a Settlement Agreement (Exhibit B to this ordinance), wherein Millennium agrees to provide certain benefits such as a $20,000 Community Technology Grant to be used to assist segments of the Seattle community who are underrepresented on the public access channel and cable modem service for City-sponsored community technology centers; and

 WHEREAS, the City and Millennium have also agreed to enter into a Town Hall Fiber Construction Agreement to allow the Seattle Channel to air live programming from Town Hall events (see Attachment 2 to the Settlement Agreement in Exhibit B to this ordinance); and

 WHEREAS, on December 11, 2006, Millennium provided the City with FCC Form 394 "Application for Franchise Authority Consent to Assignment or Transfer of Control of Cable Television Franchise" (the "Application"), wherein Millennium described a series of transactions creating new financing and ownership of Millennium (the "Transaction"); and

 WHEREAS, the City, through its Office of Cable Communications ("OCC"), pursuant to its authority under SMC 21.60.520, the Franchises, and federal law, requested additional information from Millennium necessary to evaluate the Application, and following receipt of such information, deemed the Application complete on May 1, 2007; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. section 537, the City has 120 days to act upon a request for approval of a transfer after receipt of a completed application, in this case by August 28, 2007, unless an agreement is reached to extend the date, or the City's consent is implied; and

 WHEREAS, Millennium has agreed to extend the 120 day time period until December 1, 2007; and

 WHEREAS, the Transaction contemplated under the Application must be approved by City Council prior to or concurrently with the City's authorization of a renewed Millennium franchise, which is the subject of another Council Bill to be considered by the City Council in 2007, so that Millennium is in compliance with its existing Franchises; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to make the approval of the Transaction retroactive to October 26, 2006, to coincide with the date when the alleged transfer of control effectively occurred; and

 WHEREAS, Millennium has given evidence of financial responsibility and its ability to comply with the Franchises and SMC Chapter 21.60; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that the Transaction contemplated in the Application is not contrary to the public interest or federal, state, or local law; NOW THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Exhibit B: Settlement Agreement (includes Town Hall Fiber Construction Agreement)

 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

 This Settlement Agreement is entered into by and among City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City"), and Millennium Digital Media Systems, L.L.C. ("MDM Systems"), a Delaware limited liability company.

 RECITALS

 A. City and MDM Systems are parties to cable franchises authorized under Ordinances 117955 and 118361, as amended, and as transferred to MDM Systems under Ordinance 119295 (collectively, the "Franchises"), whereby City granted cable television franchises to MDM Systems to construct, maintain and operate a cable television system in certain cable franchise districts in Seattle.

 B. MDM Systems has notified City of its intent to seek renewal of the Franchises pursuant to 47 U.S.C. section 546 and City and MDM Systems have reached agreement on the terms and conditions for renewal of the Franchises ("Renewed Franchise").

 C. Millennium Digital Media Holdings, L.L.C. ("MDM Holdings") is the indirect but ultimate parent of MDM Systems. Prior to October of 2006, all of the membership interests in MDM Holdings were owned by four investment groups, including TSG Cable Investment Corporation ("TSG"), TSG Cable Investment Corporation III ("TSG III"), Millennium Digital Media, L.L.C. ("MDM") and Caravelle Millennium Investment Corporation ("Caravelle").

 D. On or about October 26, 2006, MDM Holdings redeemed and retired the membership interests of TSG, TSG III and MDM in a series of transactions that resulted in the acquisition of membership interests by Highland Crusader Offshore Partners, L.P. ("Highland"), an entity created, and in good standing, under the laws of Bermuda; Madeleine, L.L.C. ("Madeleine"), a New York limited liability company; Credit Suisse International, a foreign corporation organized under the laws of England and Wales; and Bear Stearns Credit Products Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively and together with Caravelle, the "Assignee"). Madeleine has since conveyed its interests to Highland. These transactions are collectively referred to as the "Transaction."

 E. Section 14 of the Franchises and Subsection 21.60.520 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) provide that a cable franchise may not be transferred to another person without the approval of City. Section 14 also provides that substantial property owned and operated by the grantee of a franchise may not be transferred without the consent of City.

 F. On December 11, 2006, MDM Systems provided City with a Form FCC 394 "Application for Franchise Authority Consent to Assignment or Transfer of Control of Cable Television Franchise" (the "Application") reporting on the Transaction and providing documentation. MDM Systems has since supplemented the documentation. MDM Systems maintains that the Transaction did not constitute a transfer and/or change in control under its Franchises or SMC 21.60.520.

 G. City maintains that the Transaction allowed MDM Systems to restructure its debt and secure financing to continue meeting its franchise and other business obligations and resulted in a transfer and/or a transfer of control under MDM Systems' Franchises and SMC 21.60.520.

 H. To the extent the Transaction did constitute a transfer, failure to obtain City approval prior to the Transaction could be considered a violation of the Franchises and could subject MDM Systems to liquidated damages in the amount of $265 per day from the date of violation.

 I. MDM Systems and City now desire to conclude, settle, release and discharge once and forever, all rights, claims, causes of actions, liabilities, disputes and demands relating to the Transaction and any alleged violation of the Franchises or the Seattle Municipal Code as well as any liquidated damages that could be assessed by City on MDM Systems as a result of the Transaction.

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations hereinafter set forth, and for good and valuable mutual consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Settlement Agreement hereto agree as follows:

 AGREEMENTS

 1. Transfer Consent by City.

 City grants the Application and City consents to and approves the transfer and/or assignment requested in the Application. The parties agree that City acted on the Application in a timely manner under federal law.

 2. Release of Claims by City.

 City hereby fully surrenders to and releases, acquits, and forever discharges MDM Systems, its officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees, predecessors, successors, and assigns, and MDM Systems' parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees, predecessors, successors, and assigns, from any and all manner of action and actions, cause and causes of action, suits, damages (including liquidated damages), sums of money, demands or claims (as that term is defined at 11 U.S.C. section101(5, whatsoever, in law or in equity, direct or indirect, whether or not now known, suspected or claimed, which it ever had, now has, or may have arising from or in any way related to the Transaction.

 3. Consideration by MDM Systems.

 MDM Systems shall make available the following to City (definitions for all capitalized terms are the same as those in the Renewed Franchise, unless otherwise noted):

 A. Lower-Priced Tier. Within six (6) months of the Effective Date, MDM Systems shall establish a lower-priced Cable Service tier to be offered throughout the term of the Renewed Franchise. This lower- priced tier will have an initial price not to exceed $19.99 per month and will be comprised of approximately 30 channels. MDM Systems shall take such steps as necessary to insure that Subscribers and potential Subscribers have ready access to information concerning the lower-priced tier through, at a minimum, posting on MDM Systems' website pages accessible to Seattle Subscribers and by telephone upon request to MDM Systems' customer service representatives.

 B. Cable Modem Service. Upon the Effective Date, MDM Systems, while it or its affiliates hold the Renewed Franchise, agrees to provide Internet service at no cost to (i) those community technology sites that it was providing complimentary Internet service to in 2006, and (ii) such other community technology sites mutually agreed to in writing by City and MDM Systems; provided the number of other community technology sites designated pursuant to clause (ii) hereof shall not exceed fifty (50) different locations and MDM Systems shall not unreasonably disagree regarding sites proposed by City to be served. Complimentary Internet service shall consist of (i) a line extension to the building; (ii) one drop to a room specified by the organization; (iii) technical and customer service support to ensure the service and equipment is in working order; and (iv) static IP addresses as requested but not to exceed fifty (50) IP addresses. Complimentary Internet service shall be installed and activated within 30 days of a request from City unless an alternative schedule is mutually agreed upon.

 C. Goodwill Commitment to Explore Use of New Technologies. See Attachment 1 for further details.

 D. KIRO Advertising Grant. Beginning January 1, 2008, and on January 1 of each year thereafter throughout the term of the Renewed Franchise, MDM Systems shall make available an annual grant in the amount of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars worth of advertising spots on KIRO TV to be used at City's discretion. In the event City does not use the full grant in any given year, it may not carry over the unused portion of the grant into subsequent years. The full value of the commitment by MDM Systems will be recognized as fulfilled annually based on the availability of the spots regardless of whether or not City chooses to use the advertising spots.

 E. Advertising Credit. In the side letter between City of Seattle and Comcast of WA I, Inc. and Comcast of WA IV, Inc. ("Comcast"), dated April 9, 2006, Comcast agreed to provide City with a $50,000 annual credit ("Advertising Credit") to be used for the purchase of air time to promote programs airing on the Government Access Channel. This enables City to purchase commercial spots on Comcast's cable system from Comcast Spotlight, which is Comcast's advertising sales division. MDM Systems does not have a similar advertising sales division; instead, MDM Systems uses Comcast Spotlight to sell advertising spots on MDM Systems' cable system. Throughout the term of Comcast's Franchise authorized under Ordinance 122089 or January 20, 2016, whichever is greater, whenever City uses the Advertising Credit to purchase a commercial spot from Comcast Spotlight that airs on Comcast's cable system, MDM Systems shall permit that commercial spot to air either simultaneously on MDM Systems' cable system or in a comparable time slot at no charge to City.

 F. Community Technology Grant. Within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, Millennium shall provide the City a technology grant in the amount of $20,000. This funding shall be used to establish a grant fund to assist segments of the Seattle community who are underrepresented (e.g. ethnically, economically) on the public access channel but who want to utilize the channel to have their voices heard and tell their stories. This grant fund shall be administered by the City's Designated Public Access Manager, SCAN, in cooperation with the Department of Information Technology.

 G. VOD. Within twelve (12) months of the Effective Date, MDM Systems will establish a Video on Demand ("VOD") service offering to its Seattle Subscribers. VOD is the delivery of video content, in broadcast quality, over a cable system to an individual Subscriber. Such content is initiated by the Subscriber at his or her time of choosing and is delivered to the Subscriber as an individual data stream ("Unicast"). The content will allow for VCR-type

 functionality, such as record, fast-forward and pause.

 H. Customer Service Upgrades. Within twelve (12) months of the Effective Date, MDM Systems shall carry out the following plans in an effort to improve customer responsiveness and to increase overall customer satisfaction:

 1. MDM Systems will establish a new centralized call center with expanded hours that will provided three additional hours per day over what was provided during 2006 of live customer service for Seattle customers. MDM Systems intends to further expand available live customer support over time.

 2. MDM Systems will move to new office facilities to consolidate the technical, engineering, service, and operations staff under one roof.

 I. Planned System Upgrades. Within twelve (12) months of the Effective Date unless otherwise noted,, MDM Systems shall make the following system upgrades in the Franchise Area in an effort to increase system reliability, enhance customer experience, and correct any system compliance issues:

 1. MDM Systems will establish new network management support through IBBS that will provide 24/7 support for network monitoring alerts and traffic management.

 2. MDM Systems will increase the number of High Definition (HD) channels available to its Seattle Subscribers.

 3. MDM Systems will execute a technical compliance plan, approved by the Department of Information Technology ("DoIT"), to inspect and correct, if necessary, all noncompliant subscriber cable drop connections within MDM Systems' service area to be completed by December 1, 2008. MDM Systems will provide quarterly progress reports to City in accordance with the approved plan.

 J. Complementary Cable Service.

 1. MDM Systems shall install and furnish, at its sole cost, Basic Cable TV Service, including any required terminal equipment, to buildings in the Franchise Area owned and operated by the City for public purposes and not residential use (residential areas of fire and police stations excepted), as designated by the City.

 2. MDM Systems shall install and furnish, at its sole cost, Basic Cable TV Service and "cable in the classroom" (or a reasonably available alternative program), including any required terminal equipment, to every School building in the Franchise Area.

 K. MDM Systems shall construct a fiber connection to Town Hall pursuant to a written agreement that is substantially in the form of the "Town Hall Fiber Construction Agreement" attached hereto as Attachment 2.

 L. As to section 3, subparagraphs B, D, E, F, I, J and K above, MDM Systems expressly waives: 1) any and all rights it may have under applicable laws to recover any consideration provided thereunder from

 City; 2) any rights it may have to offset or deduct any consideration provided thereunder from past, present or future franchise fee payments owed City; and 3) any rights it may have to pass through as a separate line item on Subscriber bills any consideration associated with the requirements set forth thereunder.

 4. Effective Date

 The effective date of this Settlement Agreement ("Effective Date") shall be the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill _______ (Ordinance __________) authorizing the Renewed Franchise.

Each party has carefully and completely read all of the terms and provisions of this Settlement Agreement. It is understood and agreed by City and MDM Systems that neither this Settlement Agreement nor anything herein shall be deemed to be an admission or confession by MDM Systems of any liability whatsoever or any breach of the terms of the Franchises or violation of SMC 21.60.520. If this Settlement Agreement should be deemed unenforceable, the parties shall have all rights under applicable law to pursue any and all remedies available.

 6. Binding Effect

 This Settlement Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and respective successors and assigns. The parties for themselves and their respective successors and assigns agree to join in or execute any instruments and to do any other act or thing necessary or proper to carry into effect this or any part of this Settlement Agreement.

 7. Governing Law

 This Settlement Agreement shall be interpreted and adjudicated in

 accordance with the laws of the State of Washington.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Settlement Agreement as their free and voluntary acts and deeds.

 By: Date

 Title:

 Attachment 1 - Goodwill Commitment to Explore Use of New Technologies

 Attachment 2 - Town Hall Fiber Construction Agreement

 GOODWILL COMMITMENT TO EXPLORE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES

 The City of Seattle ("City") and Millennium Digital Media. L.L.C. ("Millennium) agree to work together to explore the possible uses of advanced broadband technology for the mutual benefit of the City, Millennium and the residents and businesses of the City. The City seeks to explore the use of broadband technology to strengthen the communication of the City with its residents by using innovative ways to enhance civic discourse. The City and Millennium agree to explore possible ways to work together to find creative ways to apply new technology to public process. The City hopes to add value to the franchise, increase understanding and support for City programs, increase citizen participation in public policy matters and provide a model for other municipalities seeking maximum public benefit from cable franchises.

 This document is not intended to create binding legal obligations on either party, but, rather, it is to confirm the parties' understandings that each is willing to work in mutual good faith throughout the term of the franchise to achieve the goals outlined herein.

 The City hopes to develop applications that bring information and City services to the public, applications that explore municipal use of cable and Internet for e-commerce and billing, and applications that allow interactive polling and on-line voting. Millennium understands that it is very difficult at this time for the City to fully define all applications and services that will be enabled as the capabilities of broadband technology evolve. Millennium agrees to work cooperatively with the City in the future in an effort to determine how the City can best utilize network capacity available for municipal purposes. Millennium agrees to consult and meet with the City of Seattle, and to the extent Millennium has resources available to do so, help the City better define how it plans to use the agreed upon channels and bandwidth capacity.

 The City hopes to create an array of municipal services that stretch across technical platforms and technologies: a "Democracy Portal" that will build on Seattle's current successes in new communications strategies and provide the means for citizens to easily and meaningfully interact with their elected officials and decision makers. The City has an active presence on the Web, with an award- winning website. The Seattle Channel is on the forefront of methods to merge the Internet and television as channels for improved citizen participation. The City believes this approach will expand the content and service value of these resources. The City and Millennium commit themselves to exploring collaboration on uses of this advanced communications strategy.

 Millennium and the City recognize that "channel number" assignments may lose some significance in an on-demand environment where the selection of video streams is similar to the point and click method typically associated with a web page on the Internet. Millennium and the City further recognize that during term of this franchise video programming could be accessed by subscribers over its cable system

 from a graphic interface similar to a web portal. Such a graphic interface, sometimes referred to as a "walled garden", will offer subscribers a menu of options including video programming. Millennium agrees that if it creates such a user interface, it will

 discuss with the City the option of placing an icon of the City's choosing on the top layer of any "walled garden" or other similar user interface so that subscribers will have ready access to local non commercial programming. The City of Seattle in turn will support the use of content from the City of Seattle to the Millennium "home page" environment to add to the local experience for subscribers.

 The Franchise agreement includes the use of television channels for Public, Education and Government (PEG) programming. As the technical capacity of the interactive television platform matures, the City and Millennium will explore possible pilot deployments of interactive capability for government purposes. Both parties recognize that the form and use of interactive television is at a formative stage. The mutual participation in such an effort could take a number of forms to support the Democracy Portal, or might possibly include the use of "instant polling" functions during City deliberative processes and/or the possible delivery of viewer comments, via the interactive television experience. The City will commit to work with Millennium and its partners in the development of interactive options to carefully respect any and all system or contractual restraints, set top box technology, programming methods, bandwidth constraints, and evolving business plans. Early notification to the City of the programming standards and requirements to support the Millennium technology may help to facilitate the City as possibly being an early provider of content. It is the hope of the City that the provision of such early interactive content will offer enhanced value for services which will be offered by Millennium as a result of its new technology and network to be deployed within the City. The City understands that Millennium's assistance must be consistent with its core operational and business needs, taking into account any immediate or potential impact on Millennium's network, customers, business plan and strategy. Millennium in turn acknowledges that the City seeks to maintain its role in providing its residents access to the most advanced technological services.

Daryl and Sheila have another location that the fiber (12 single mode "SM") needs to be extended and terminated at also in the "Downstairs at Town Hall" Auditorium. Sheila Smith from Town Hall shall determine whether flex-steel is used and painted to match the walls or another surface mount conduit is used. The total distance is estimated at under 400 feet.
