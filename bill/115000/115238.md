 WHEREAS, in July, 1998, Resolution 29795 provided guidance for the creation of a Municipal Civic Center Master Plan, which included researching re-use strategies for the Alaska and Arctic Buildings, including schedules and disposition strategies; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle established a Civic Center Client Group, which includes three Councilmembers, the Deputy Mayor, the Finance Director, and the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department, to oversee the implementation of the Civic Center Master Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Master Plan envisioned the sale of the Alaska Building and upgrade of the Arctic Building for City occupancy; and

 WHEREAS, a 2004 analysis of the Arctic Building indicated the building would require more seismic upgrades and major maintenance than previously contemplated, resulting in a Civic Center Client Group recommendation that it was prudent to sell both the Alaska and Arctic Buildings; and

 WHEREAS, one of the Civic Center Master Plan's goals is to realize revenue from the sale or lease of assets that are no longer needed to meet the City's space needs; and

 WHEREAS, the Fleets and Facilities Department offered the Alaska and Arctic Buildings for sale through an open, competitive process; and

 WHEREAS, a 2004 review of City space requirements resulted in a Civic Center Client Group recommendation that space needs for those City offices currently occupying the Alaska and Arctic Buildings be served through a combination of City-owned space in the Seattle Municipal Tower and privately owned and leased space in the Second or Third Avenue corridor; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of the City's competitive process, The Arctic Club Hotel, LLC entered into the Purchase & Sale Agreement attached hereto as Attachment 1, agreeing to pay a purchase price of $5,6000,000, subject to reasonable due diligence investigation of the building; and

 WHEREAS, the purchaser Arctic Club Hotel LLC, intends to renovate the building from the presently existing office use to a hotel use subject to the historic preservation requirements associated with the building; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of certain seismic and building other conditions discovered during due diligence which affected the value of the building as well as the nature and cost of renovations necessary to convert the building from office to hotel use, Arctic Club Hotel, LLC has agreed to pay a purchase price of $5,100,000 in cash at closing and intends to redevelop the Arctic Building into a hotel all as reflected in the Purchase & Sale Agreement and its amendment attached to this Ordinance as Attachment 2; and

 WHEREAS, the schedule for relocating City departments from the Arctic Building contemplates that the City will execute leases with the purchaser of this Building and continue to occupy certain portions of the Building for certain temporary periods after the sale closes; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Arctic Building should be reserved and used to pay a portion of the 2005/2006 occupancy costs for downtown office space, to address expense and revenue adjustments associated with the sale of the Building which could not be anticipated in the development of the 2005 Adopted Budget and 2006 Endorsed Budget; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Arctic Building should be reserved to pay those costs associated with relocating City departments that are not already budgeted in the Municipal Civic Center Fund; and

 WHEREAS, that portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Arctic Building that is required to defease outstanding tax-exempt bonds issued by the City to refinance the City's purchase of the Arctic Building should be reserved and applied for that purpose; NOW, THEREFORE,

 4.3 Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any costs, loss and damage whatsoever incurred as a result of Purchaser's entry upon the Property prior to the date of Closing or the date this Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier; provided however that in no event shall Purchaser be liable for any Hazardous Material cleanup or remediation for any condition which may have been discovered in Purchaser's non-negligent investigation of the Property. If Purchaser does not purchase the Property, Purchaser covenants and agrees to repair any damage caused by Purchaser in the conduct of any inspection, study or survey, however, Purchaser shall have no liability for any existing condition of the Property including any condition related to Hazardous Materials which may have been discovered during Purchaser's non-negligent investigation.

 PART B - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 1. POSSESSION. The City is selling the entire Building to Lessor and leasing back the Premises from Lessor upon closing in accordance with that certain purchase and sale agreement entered into between the City and Lessor and date January 20, 2005 (the "Purchase Agreement"). Accordingly, possession of the Premises by the City shall occur immediately upon such closing of the sale under the Purchase Agreement.

 2. ACCESS. The City shall allow the Lessor or the Lessor's agent free access at all reasonable times to said Premises to inspect, clean, or make repairs, additions or alterations to the Premises or any connected property owned by or under the control of the Lessor. This provision shall not be construed as an agreement on the part of the Lessor to make such repairs, additions or alterations nor a waiver of the City's right of quiet enjoyment. All such work by the Lessor shall be undertaken in a way so as to not unduly interfere with the City's use of the Premises. As stated in the Purchase Agreement, the City acknowledges and agrees that Lessor may be engaged in construction activities in the Building and adjacent to the Premises during the Tem of this Lease.

 3. UTILITIES AND OTHER SERVICES. Unless otherwise specified in Part A, hereof, the Lessor, at the Lessor's sole expense, shall provide or shall otherwise pay for, when due, all costs for providing all utilities and other services on or to the Premises including but not limited to elevator service, electricity, gas, water, sewer, garbage (but not garbage or refuse collection in connection with refuse generated in the City's cleaning and moving its facilities from the Premises), heating and cooling or air conditioning, janitorial, and security. The City shall pay all charges for utility installations and modifications thereto occasioned by the City's requirements. Lessor does not warrant that any utilities or services will be free from interruption including by reason of accident, repairs, alterations or improvements. No utility interruption shall be deemed an eviction or disturbance of the City, or render Lessor liable to the City for damages, or relieve Lessor from the full and complete performance of all of the City's obligations under this Lease.

 4. CARE OF PREMISES. The Premises shall at all times be kept and used in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and ordinances of The City of Seattle, and in accordance with all duly authorized directions, rules, and regulations of the Health Officer, Fire Marshall or other proper officer of The City of Seattle; and the City will not permit any waste, damage or injury to the Premises, use or permit in said Premises anything that will increase the rate of fire insurance thereon, maintain anything that may be dangerous to life or limb, permit any objectionable noise or odor to escape or to be emitted from said Premises, or permit anything to be done upon said Premises that in any way will tend to create a nuisance. The City shall keep the interior spaces in the Premises, including all fixtures, clean and in good order, repair and condition.

 5. MAINTENANCE - REPAIRS. The Premises have been inspected by both parties and are accepted by the City in their existing condition as of the commencement date of this lease, without reservation. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the Lessor, at its sole expense, shall keep and preserve the Premises in good repair, including but not limited to all structural and non-structural parts thereof, elevators, plumbing, heating, cooling, and electrical, gas and other utility systems; and other equipment and appurtenances of the Premises and the structure of which the Premises form a part.

 6. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. In the event the Premises are damaged by fire, earthquake, act of war, or other extraordinary casualty to such an extent as to render the same untenantable in whole or in a substantial part thereof, or are destroyed, it shall be optional with the Lessor to repair or rebuild the same, and after the happening of any such event, the City shall give the Lessor or the Lessor's agent written notice thereof within forty-eight (48) hours of such occurrence. The Lessor shall have not more than ten (10) days after the date of such notification to notify the City in writing of the Lessor's intentions to repair or rebuild said Premises; and if the Lessor elects to repair or rebuild said Premises, the Lessor shall prosecute the work of such repairing or rebuilding without unnecessary delay. During any period in which the Premises are rendered unfit for occupancy because of any such casualty, the rent of said Premises shall be abated in the same ratio that the portion of the Premises rendered for the time being unfit for occupancy bears to the whole of the Premises. In the event the building in which the Premises are located is destroyed or is damaged (even though the Premises hereby leased is not damaged thereby) to such an extent that, in the opinion of the Lessor, it is not practicable to repair or rebuild, then the Lessor may, at its option, terminate the lease by providing written notice thereof to the City within thirty (30) days after such damage or destruction has been determined to be irreparable.

 7. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW

Therefore, it is agreed by the Lessor and the City that notwithstanding any other provision herein, in the event said funding and/or program is increased, changed, decreased, or eliminated, or in the judgment of the executive or legislative authority of the City, continuation of the lease to its full term would be an unnecessary expenditure of public funds, then the City may terminate this lease without further obligation to the Lessor, after the City has provided the Lessor with written notice of such termination at least ninety (90) days prior to the effective date thereof and documentation of such executive or legislative action.

No waiver of default by either party of any of the terms, covenants, and conditions hereof to be performed, kept and observed by the other party shall be construed as, or operated as, a waiver of any subsequent default or of any of the terms, covenants, and conditions herein contained, to be performed, kept and observed by the other party.

 18. BINDING EFFECT. This lease shall be binding upon the heirs, successors, assigns, and all other parties legally empowered with signatory rights of any or all of the parties hereto.

 EXHIBIT B TO ATTACHMENT 2

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

 THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between Artic Club Hotel LLC, a Washington limited liability company (hereinafter the "Employer"), and the UNITE HERE, Local 8, AFL-CIO (the "Union").

 1. This Agreement shall cover all employees employed in classifications listed in Exhibit A, or in classifications called by different names when performing similar duties, (referred to hereinafter as "Employees") at a hotel to be located at 700 Third Avenue and Cherry Street in Seattle, Washington (hereinafter referred to as the "Hotel") which during the term of this Agreement is owned by, operated by or substantially under the control of the Employer. The Hotel is to be located within the Arctic Building (the "Building"). The term "Employer" shall be deemed to include any person, firm, partnership, corporation, joint venture or other legal entity substantially under the control of: (a) the Employer covered by this Agreement; (b) one or more principal(s) of the Employer covered by this Agreement; (c) a subsidiary of the Employer covered by this Agreement; or (d) any person, firm, partnership, corporation, joint venture or other legal entity which substantially controls the Employer covered by this Agreement.

 2. The parties hereby establish the following procedure for the purpose of ensuring an orderly environment for the exercise by the Employees of their rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act and to avoid picketing and/or other economic action directed at the Employer in the event the Union decides to conduct an organizing campaign among Employees.

 3. The parties mutually recognize that national labor law guarantees employees the right to form or select any labor organization to act as their exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining with their employer, or to refrain from such activity.

 4. The Employer will take an approach of strict neutrality to the unionization of Employees. The Employer will not do any action nor make any statement that will directly or indirectly state or imply any opposition by the Employer to the selection by such Employees of a collective bargaining agent, or preference for or opposition to any particular union as a bargaining agent.

 5. The Union and its representatives will not coerce or threaten any Employee in an effort to obtain authorization cards or otherwise.

 6. The Employer may hire any Employees at any time at its sole and absolute discretion and regardless of whether or not any such Employee applicant has been provided by the Union. Subject to the foregoing, if the Employer finds it necessary to hire new Employees for vacancies in job classifications covered by this Agreement at the Hotel, the Employer shall notify the Union to request applicants for such vacancies, provided that if time constraints require rapid hiring decisions, the Employer may in its sole discretion hire Employees without such notification. When requesting applicants, the Employer shall state the qualifications applicants are expected to possess. The Union may furnish applicants for the job vacancies specified by the Employer. The Union's selection of applicants for referral shall be on a non-discriminatory basis and shall not be based upon or in any way affected by membership in the Union or the Union's bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspects or obligation of Union membership policies or requirements, or upon personal characteristics of an applicant where discrimination based upon such characteristics is prohibited by law. The Employer agrees that any interest demonstrated by an applicant in joining the Union shall not constitute grounds for discriminatory or disparate treatment nor adversely impact the applicant's ability to be hired by the Employer. The Employer shall be the sole judge of an applicant's suitability, competence and qualifications to perform the work of any job to be filled and the above understanding shall not be the exclusive means of Employer recruitment.

 7. If the Union provides written notice to the Employer of its intent to organize Employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall provide access to its premises and to such Employees by the Union. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Union may engage in organizing efforts only in non-public areas of the Hotel during Employees' non-working times (before work, after work, and during meals and breaks) and/or during such other periods as the parties may mutually agree upon in writing in advance.

 8. Within ten (10) days following receipt of written notice of intent to organize Employees, the Employer will furnish the Union with a complete list of such Employees, including both full and part-time Employees, showing their job classifications and departments. Within two (2) weeks thereafter, the Employer will furnish a second list of such Employees to the Union, including the home addresses of all Employees. Thereafter, the Employer will provide updated complete lists quarterly or not more than monthly upon specific request from the Union.

 9. The Union may request recognition as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for such Employees. The Arbitrator identified in Paragraph 13, or another person mutually agreed to by Employer and Union, will conduct a review of Employees' authorization cards and membership information submitted by the Union in support of its claim to represent a majority of such Employees. If that review establishes that a majority of such Employees has designated the Union as their exclusive collective bargaining representative or joined the Union, the Employer will recognize the Union as such representative of such Employees. The Employer will not file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for any election in connection with any demands for recognition provided for in this agreement. The Union and the Employer will not file any charges with the National Labor Relations Board in connection with any act or omission occurring within the context of this agreement; arbitration under Paragraph 13 shall be the exclusive remedy.

 10. During the life of this Agreement, the Union will not engage in picketing or other economic activity at the Hotel, and the Employer will not engage in a lockout of the Employees. This paragraph will expire with respect to any group of Employees upon recognition of the Union as the representative of such Employees pursuant to paragraph 9. Notwithstanding the termination provision above, if the Employer recognizes any union besides Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of Employees, or any of them, this paragraph shall terminate immediately and without notice.

 11. In the event that the Employer sells, transfers, or assigns all or any part of its right, title, or interest in the Hotel or substantially all of the assets used in the operation of the Hotel, or in the event there is a change in the form of ownership of the Employer, the Employer shall give the Union reasonable advance notice thereof in writing, and the Employer further agrees that as a condition to any such sale, assignment, or transfer, the Employer will obtain from its successor or successors in interest a written assumption of this Agreement and furnish a copy thereof to the Union, in which event the assignor shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent that the assignor has fully transferred its right, title, or interest.

 12. The Employer shall incorporate the entirety of paragraphs 4,6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of this of Agreement in any contract, subcontract, lease, sublease, operating agreement, franchise agreement or any other agreement or instrument (except as provided otherwise in this paragraph or this Agreement) giving a right to any person to operate any enterprise in the Hotel employing employees in classifications listed in Exhibit A, or in classifications called by different names when performing similar duties, and shall obligate any person taking such interest, and any and all successors and assigns of such person, to in turn incorporate said paragraphs in any further agreement or instrument giving a right as described above. This Agreement and the provisions of this paragraph 12 shall apply only to Employees of the Hotel. This Agreement and the provisions of this paragraph 12 shall not apply to any lease of space in the Building or employees of any lessee of space in the Building, including but not limited to restaurant workers or retail workers hired by lessees operating under any lease of space within the Building, provided that the lessee is in an arm's-length relationship with the Employer. The Employer shall enforce such provisions, or at its option, assign its rights to do so to the Union. The Employer shall give the Union written notice of the execution of such agreement or instrument and identify the other party(ies) to the transaction within 15 days after the agreement or instrument is signed. The terms "Employer" and "Hotel" shall be modified in such agreement or instrument to conform to the terminology in such agreement or instrument but retain the same meaning as in this Agreement, and the terms "Employer" and "Employees" as used herein shall be modified to refer, respectively, to the person or persons receiving a right to operate an enterprise in the Hotel and the employees of such person or persons.

 13. The parties agree that any disputes over the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be submitted to expedited and binding arbitration, with Philip Kienast serving as the arbitrator. If he is unavailable to serve within thirty (30) calendar days of notification then another mutually acceptable person shall be the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the arbitration procedures to be followed. The arbitrator shall also have the authority to order the non-compliant party to comply with this Agreement. The parties hereto agree to comply with any order of the arbitrator, which shall be final and binding, and furthermore consent to the entry of any order of the arbitrator as the order or judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, without entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law.

 14. This Agreement shall be in full force and effect from the date it is fully executed on behalf of the Employer and the Union until the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date that is Two years from the full public opening of the hotel or (b) December 1, 2010. The Employer estimates, but is not bound to, an opening date in Summer 2006.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto by their duly designated representatives have hereunto set their hands.
