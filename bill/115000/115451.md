 EXHIBIT A

 Public Bid

 Procedure for Disposing

 of Real Property

 * The basis for disposing of property shall be by sealed competitive bid. Each property is to be conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL- FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE PURCHASER'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. The City makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to the condition of the property to be conveyed to the purchaser. Prospective bidders will be given the opportunity to inspect the property prior to bidding, and to have any professional tests or inspections conducted at the bidders' sole expense and risk, subject to such conditions as the Housing Director shall deem appropriate.

 * Notice of the proposed offering will be given to taxpayers within a thousand (1,000) foot radius of each site being offered for sale, district councils and community groups interested in the area.

 * Conveyance shall be by Quit Claim Deed.

 * Bid packets shall include a brief description of each property offered, a neighborhood map, an Offer Sheet and a sample Quit Claim Deed. Copies of the bid packet and other related documents shall be available to prospective bidders on request.

 * Notice of the sale shall be given by publication in the Seattle Times and the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce and other appropriate print media, through direct mail to interested parties, and by such other means as the Housing Director shall determine to be reasonable, fair, and effective for the marketing of the property, including a posted "For Sale" sign on the site.

 * An acceptable price shall be a price above a threshold set by the Housing Director below which she may reject any and all bids. The threshold will be based on an opinion of value, and will not be made public prior to the bid opening.

 * If the property is located in an area zoned to permit the operation of retail business, then consistent with RCW 35.87.020 the first right to purchase will be offered to any bidder that is a private corporation or association (1) established to develop and maintain free public parking facilities and (2) which agrees to dedicate such property for free public parking. If any such bidder offers more than the threshold price, then the highest bid from such a bidder shall be selected and the property shall be sold to such bidder at the lower of such bid or the fair market value of the property as determined by the Housing Director, and the form of Quit Claim Deed shall be modified consistent with RCW 35.87.030.

 * Except as provided in the previous paragraph, the successful bidder shall be the one offering the highest price equal to or exceeding the threshold price and agreeing to the terms of the Quit Claim Deed as authorized by ordinance.

 * The Housing Director has the right to reject any or all bids. OH will evaluate whether to re-advertise or to consider other alternatives for the property.

 * The successful bidder must complete the sale, paying the full amount of its bid by cashier's check or equivalent acceptable to the Housing Director, within sixty (60) days after the Office of Housing Director selects the successful bidder. If the selected bidder fails to complete the purchase then the Housing Director may, in her discretion, sell the property to the bidder, if any, that would have been selected had the first selected bidder not bid.

 * The Housing Director may reserve the rights to waive irregularities, to allow corrections, and to extend the period in which bids may be submitted.

 * A bid deposit will be required, and in the event that the winning bidder does not close on the transaction in the time allotted, the bid deposit will be retained as liquidated damages.

 Grantor: The City of Seattle

 Grantee:

 Legal Description:

 1. Abbreviated Form:

 2. Additional legal description is on Page 1 of document.

 Assessor's Property Tax Parcel Account Number(s):

 Grant. The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("Grantor"), hereby conveys and quit claims to , ("Grantee"), for and in consideration of the sum of Dollars ($.00), and the covenants, release and indemnity set forth below, that certain real property located in the City of Seattle, King County, Washington, and legally described as follows ("Property"):

 GRANTEE's COVENANTS, RELEASES AND INDEMNITY ("COVENANT")

 The Property is conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE GRANTEE'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. Grantee acknowledges that adverse physical, economic or other conditions (including without limitation, adverse environmental soils and ground-water conditions), either latent or patent, may exist on the Property and assumes Grantor's responsibility for all environmental conditions of the Property, known or unknown, including but not limited to responsibility, if any, for investigation, removal or remediation actions relating to the presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance or other environmental contamination relating to the Property. Grantee also releases, covenants not to sue, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Grantor and its past, present and future officials, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties, fees, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to fees and costs of regulatory agencies, attorneys, contractors and consultants), and liabilities arising out of, or in any way connected with, the condition of the Property including but not limited to any alleged or actual past, present or future presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property, or any portion thereof or improvement thereon, from any cause whatsoever; it being intended that Grantee shall so indemnify Grantor and such personnel without regard to any fault or responsibility of Grantor or Grantee. The obligation to complete all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of the Property and the acknowledgements, releases, and covenants herein touch and concern the Property, are intended to run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and assigns. Grantee is aware of the rights it might otherwise have to seek recovery from Grantor for costs of remediation and cleanup of Hazardous Substances under applicable law, including without limitation the Washington Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA") and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and Grantee hereby knowingly waives all such rights, now existing or hereafter arising, and voluntarily relinquishes those rights and forever releases the Grantor from any such obligation.

 Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantor is not responsible in any way for the accuracy or completeness of any reports provided to Grantee, and Grantee waives and releases Grantor and its past, present and future officers and employees from any duty to provide any information to correct or supplement any such reports or to provide any other information about the condition of the Property or any Hazardous Substances on, in, under or near the Property, whether or not Grantor or any such person has knowledge or notice of any such information.

 For purposes of this COVENANT, the term "Hazardous Substance" shall mean petroleum products and compounds containing them; flammable materials; radioactive materials; polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") and compounds containing them; lead; asbestos or asbestos-containing materials in any friable form; underground or above-ground storage tanks; and any substance or material that is now or hereafter becomes regulated under any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law relating to environmental protection, contamination or cleanup.

 Grantee's release and covenant not to sue shall include both claims by Grantee as original plaintiff against Grantor and any cross- claims, third-party claims or other claims against Grantor by Grantee based upon claims made against Grantee by any third parties. The obligation to indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action costs and natural resources damages claims. This COVENANT means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-is, where-is and with-all- faults," and that Grantee assumes all responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any contamination and other adverse environmental conditions on the Property, and has no recourse against Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or liability with respect to the Property. This COVENANT shall apply regardless of whether or not Grantee is culpable, negligent or in violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation. Nothing herein shall release, discharge or affect any rights or causes of action that Grantor or Grantee may have against any other person or entity, except as otherwise expressly stated herein, and each of the parties reserves all such rights including, but not limited to, claims for contribution or cost recovery relating to any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property.

 Nondiscrimination. Grantee further covenants that there shall be no discrimination upon the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in the sale, lease or rental, or in the use or occupancy, of the Property or any improvements erected or to be erected thereon. Both the Grantor and the United States of America shall be entitled to enforce this paragraph, which shall run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns.
