 Attachment A: Agreement between The City of Seattle and The Seattle Parks Foundation regarding South Lake Union Park

 AGREEMENT Between THE CITY OF SEATTLE And THE SEATTLE PARKS FOUNDATION Regarding SOUTH LAKE UNION PARK

 This Agreement (the "Agreement") regarding South Lake Union Park (the "Park") is entered into by and between the City of Seattle (the "City"), a Washington municipal corporation, acting through its Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Seattle Parks Foundation (the "Foundation"), a Washington nonprofit corporation, collectively the Parties.

 RECITALS

 Whereas, the 1903 Olmsted Park and Boulevard Plan for Seattle recommended a park at the south end of Lake Union that would serve residents and businesses of the north downtown community; and

 Whereas, between 1984 and 2003, the City has invested approximately $17.5 million in the purchase and interim development of South Lake Union Park and allocated another $5 million Pro Parks Levy funds toward the planning, design, and development of the park; and

 Whereas, in 2003, following a nation-wide search, the City hired Hargreaves Associates and Mithun to complete the design of the new South Lake Union Park; and

 Whereas, in 2004, the plan for South Lake Union Park was developed following extensive public outreach and input including stakeholder meetings, public workshops, and public hearings; and

 Whereas, the City has prioritized the redevelopment of the South Lake Union area into a mixed-use neighborhood, including developing a range of residential and employment opportunities, and South Lake Union Park is critical to the success of that vision; and

 Whereas, City Council Resolution 29781 affirmed the desire of the City for an independent parks foundation to increase resources available for parks purposes in Seattle; and

 Whereas, in 1999, a group of business, civic and philanthropic leaders founded the Seattle Parks Foundation as an independent, non- profit organization to provide funds, project support, and advocacy to improve and expand Seattle's parks and green spaces; and

 Whereas, in 2001, the Seattle Parks Foundation opened its doors at South Lake Union Park and since that time, it has raised $4 million for neighborhood park projects throughout the city including two brand new parks, four children's play areas, and three unique park renovation projects; and

 Whereas, in 2002, the Seattle Parks Foundation adopted South Lake Union Park as its first major park project because of its unique location, ready partners, and the positive impact it will have on the livability of the city, and committed its efforts over the next three (3) years to the furtherance of this park's development through participation in the consultant selection process culminating in the naming of the Hargreaves Associates/Mithun team as the designers for the South Lake Union Park, participating in the client advisory group, advising the City and the design team on critical design issues, serving on the Project Advisory Team to provide public input to the design process, developing a partnership with the Center For Wooden Boats, completing a financial feasibility study, revising the project scope for the park based on this study, and recruiting an Advancement Task Force to plan for a capital campaign; and

 Whereas, on November 3, 2004, the Seattle Parks Foundation formally approved the final design of South Lake Union Park and formalized its commitment to the Center For Wooden Boats; and

 Whereas, on July 10, 2003, the Seattle Board of Park Commissioners approved the final design of South Lake Union Park; and

 Whereas, on March 2, 2005, the Foundation resolved to enter into an agreement with the City delineating the relative roles and responsibilities of the Parks Foundation and the City and committing the Foundation to launch a fundraising campaign to raise $20 million; and

 Whereas, on March 16, 2005, the Mayor and City Investors Inc. ("CI"), a major property owner and developer in the South Lake Union area, entered into a Memorandum of Intent regarding CI's commitment of funds to the City via the Foundation for development of the South Lake Union Park; and

 Whereas, the purpose of this agreement is to delineate the relative roles and responsibilities of the Parks Foundation and City with respect to fundraising, design, development, construction, operation and maintenance of South Lake Union Park.

 AGREEMENT

 1. Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the following terms will have the following meanings:

 1.1 "Approved Budget" means the budget for the construction of the South Lake Union Park, including both Construction Phase 1 and Construction Phase 2, substantially in the form of the working budget attached as Exhibit _A__.

 1.2 "Approved Design" means the South Lake Union Park Improvement Plan substantially in the form of the design documents attached as Exhibit _B__.

 1.3 Construction Phase 1 means construction completed consistent with the documents described in Section 1.2 above.

 1.4 Construction Phase 2 means construction completed consistent with the documents described in Section 1.2.

 1.5 South Lake Union Park means the Park to be constructed consistent with the Approved Design in the area located north of Valley Street right of way and south of Lake Union, between Kenmore Air on the northwest and CI property on the east, more specifically described in the legal description attached as Exhibit _C__.

 1.6 Superintendent means the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation of the City of Seattle.

 2. Funding.

 2.1 Funding Sources. Funding to complete construction of the Park consistent with the Approved Design and pursuant to the Approved Budget comes from three primary sources: (a) a confirmed $5 million commitment from CI dedicated to Phase 1 and a contingent additional CI $5 million commitment for Phase 2; (b) City funds and other public funds; and (c) $10 million from private sources in addition to the CI commitment to be raised by the Foundation. The Parties acknowledge that the $5 million CI commitment for Phase 2 is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions under the City's agreement with CI.

 2.2 Foundation Fundraising. The Foundation agrees to use its best efforts to secure commitments from private individuals, corporations, foundations, and other non-governmental sources for the $10 million no later than June 30, 2008. To the extent possible, all privately raised funding for the Park, specifically including the CI commitment, will be provided through the Foundation. Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement, the Foundation will submit to the Superintendent and the City Finance Director for their review and approval a plan (the "Fundraising Plan") for raising the funds by June 30, 2008. In developing the Fundraising Plan, the Foundation will rely on reputable professional advice as well as the advice and experience of its board and staff. The Fundraising Plan will include annual targets for amounts to be raised; sequential solicitation strategies; and assumptions as to when pledge payments

 will be made. To the extent necessary to ensure timely construction of the Park, the City will internally finance Park construction funding against Foundation pledges consistent with standard City practices. The cost of any such financing will be reflected in the Approved Budget. As soon as this Agreement becomes effective, and the Superintendent and City Finance Director have approved the Fundraising Plan, the Foundation will receive funds to support its multi-year effort to meet its fundraising obligation as provided in the Approved Budget pursuant to reimbursement or credit procedures to be mutually determined by the Superintendent and the Foundation. Foundation donor pledges will be reviewed by the City Finance Director under procedures to protect the confidentiality of donors and Foundation donor-related information. The Foundation will submit to the City's Finance Director a copy of pledge forms reasonably acceptable to the Finance Director, with donor names verified by the Finance Director but omitted from the copy submitted. The City Finance Director will approve a pledge if it is from a person or entity of substantial net worth in relation to the amount pledged and the Finance Director knows of no reason why the pledge will not be honored.

 3. Design and Construction.

 3.1 Project Review Committee. The Superintendent will establish a Project Review Committee. The Committee will consist of seven members: two designated by the Foundation; the Superintendent and one other Parks Department staff person; one City Finance Department staff member and representatives of two Park stakeholder groups. During construction, the Project Review Committee will meet as needed but at least monthly to review overall construction project progress and expenditures against the Approved Budget, including commitment of any contingency funds, and to discuss resolution of any issues that may require action under this Agreement. The Superintendent and the Foundation Board President will develop more formal problem or dispute resolution procedures if necessary.

 3.2 Budget Updates. The budget will be updated, reviewed and approved by the Superintendent and the Foundation prior to solicitation of bids or proposals for the construction of each of the two construction phases.

 3.3 Construction Phase 1. Provided that the City has received the $5 million in funding from CI for Phase 1 by September 1, 2005, the City will use its best efforts to commence construction by November 1, 2005 in order for Phase 1 to be completed by June 2006. The Parties recognize that there are conditions over which the City has no control that may prevent commencement of construction from occurring by November 1, 2005, including, but not limited to: construction bids coming in higher than the construction budget in the Approved Budget; and the failure of regulatory agencies (including the City acting in its regulatory capacity) to issue necessary permits for construction.

 3.4 Construction Phase 2.

 3.4.1 City Commitment to Proceed. The City will commence construction of Phase 2 as soon as practical after the Foundation has successfully completed its fundraising effort. The City's commitment to proceed with construction of Phase 2 arises as soon as the Foundation's fundraising is completed regardless of whether the conditions have been satisfied to secure release of CI's conditional additional $5 million in funding for Phase 2. The funds raised by the Foundation may include cash or cash equivalents in hand plus written pledges of payments to be made over a period not to exceed a total of five (5) years approved by the City Finance Director as provided in Section 2.2. In the event that the Foundation is unsuccessful in its efforts to raise $10 million by June 30, 2008, the Superintendent and the Foundation will attempt to reach agreement on whether to proceed with a more limited design for the Park, based on the level of funding raised to date by the Foundation and then available funds from the City and CI, or extend the time for raising the $10 million to a mutually agreeable date. If the Parties cannot reach agreement on a more limited design for the Park or an extension

 in the term of this Agreement, either party may terminate this Agreement.

 3.5 Project Procurement Process. The Foundation shall review the construction documents for the Park to ensure consistency with the Approved Design. The City will solicit bids or proposals for the construction of each of the two construction phases, consistent with the Approved Design as provided herein. Bids or proposals received will be evaluated for consistency with the construction budget within the Approved Budget. In the event the lowest responsive bid or otherwise preferred proposal from a responsible bidder exceeds the construction budget within the Approved Budget, the Project Review Committee will evaluate the bid or proposal and, if possible, recommend to the Parties changes in the Approved Design or Approved Budget to allow acceptance of the bid or proposal. Acceptance of the bid or proposal will be conditioned on the Parties approval of a revised Approved Budget or revised Approved Design or both. If the

 Parties are unable to identify and approve a combination of changes in the Approved Design and Approved Budget sufficient to enable acceptance of the bid or proposal, all bids or proposals will be rejected and the Project Review Committee will work to identify and recommend to the Parties a strategy for proceeding with the Park, which may include cutting the scope of the Approved Design, and/or adding resources to the Approved Budget. The Parties recognize that the City is bound by the public works laws of the state, and that the City may be required to rebid the construction of a construction phase (which may result in delay in the start of construction) if substantial changes are made to the scope of the Approved Design and the construction contract being bid. In the event that the City is able to enter into a construction contract(s) for Phase 2 that is less than the construction budget in the Approved Budget for Phase 2, the difference shall be added to the construction contingency for Phase 2. Any cost savings realized during construction shall also be added to the construction contingency for Phase 2. In the event that the City is able to complete construction of the Park consistent with the Approved Design and within the Approved Budget, the Foundation's obligation under this Agreement to provide funds for Park construction will be reduced by the amount of budgeted funds remaining following project closeout. However, the Foundation agrees to reserve the balance of the $10 million of funds it has raised for Park construction for future capital improvements in the Park.

 3.6 City to Construct Pursuant to Approved Design. Upon acceptance of a responsive bid or proposal from a responsible bidder that is within the construction budget of the Approved Budget for the Phase being constructed, the City agrees to construct the Park consistent with the Approved Design and will be responsible for any costs of completing construction of the Park consistent with the Approved Design in excess of the accepted bid or proposal. The City, in its sole discretion, will determine how to use the construction contingency to complete construction.

 3.7 Changes in Approved Design. Any material change to the Approved Design through completion of Construction Phase 2 requires the approval of the Superintendent and the Foundation. A material change includes any substantial departure from the Approved Design including but not limited to elimination or addition of a significant element or feature; discernible or functional alteration in the quality or projected performance of any significant feature or system; or any significant change in the use or appearance of any major space or component. Either the City or the Foundation may propose a material change. Any material change that represents an increase in the cost of the Park will be accompanied by a recommendation for funding it. Any proposal for a material change and the recommendation for funding it will be evaluated by the Project Review Committee. In approving any such proposed change, the Parties may agree to apply construction contingency funds available within the Approved Budget; apply offsetting savings from other mutually agreeable changes; or commit additional funds to supplement the Approved Budget.

 3.8 Reserved Design Issues. The Parties acknowledge that it may be necessary or desirable to make modifications to the Approved Design as a result of projects or development that may occur adjacent to the Park. For instance, the southern area of the Park adjacent to Valley Street may be affected by any Valley Street traffic revisions and associated improvements and development of the proposed streetcar. Additionally, the Park's on-shore eastern area may be affected by development of private properties adjacent to it. The Parties will jointly review possible modifications to the Approved Design as a result of projects involving or development of adjacent

 streets or properties. To the extent that any such changes resulting from City or other City-approved public projects such as Valley Street improvements or the streetcar are necessary or desirable prior to the completion of Construction Phase 2, the Parties will work to accommodate the changes within the Approved Budget to the extent that such changes can be completed with funds in the Approved Budget for the affected area reasonably allocable to such area based on its relative size or can be prudently funded within available contingencies without compromising completion of the Park consistent with the Approved Design. To the extent that any such changes cannot be so accommodated within the Approved Budget and with respect to all such changes proposed following completion of Construction Phase 2, the City will seek to include funding for such changes in the budgets of the projects impacting the Park. Such necessary or desirable changes to the Park will be undertaken only upon approval of the Parties and to the extent resources to fund them are identified. The approval of the Foundation for such changes shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 3.9 Parking. The City will develop by December 2006, for review

 and comment by the Foundation, a plan for public vehicular parking at the Park (the "Parking Plan"). The Parking Plan will address parking needs with and without Valley Street improvements and will include three time periods: prior, during and after the construction of the CI development directly south of Valley Street. The Parking Plan will include the needs of current and future users including but not limited to the Park, the Armory, the Center For Wooden Boats, the Virginia V, and the Historic Ships Wharf. The Parking Plan will reflect the parking commitments set forth in the City - CI purchase and sale agreement (as now or hereafter amended) for the properties across Valley Street from the Park. The temporary parking shown on the Approved Design will be constructed unless adequate and suitable alternate temporary parking in or adjacent to the Park is identified pursuant to the Parking Plan and, if constructed, will remain in place until adequate and suitable permanent parking is identified and provided pursuant to such Parking Plan.

 3.10 Compatible Uses. South Lake Union Park is now and will continue to be open to the public, non-gated and admission-free. Uses that support the original intent of the Park design, such as maritime festivals, cultural events and activities that reflect the history of the area will be encouraged. Uses that limit public access to and use of a substantial portion of the Park grounds for an extended period of time or for a series of events scheduled over an extended period of time (beyond a special event that typically lasts no longer than a few days) will not be allowed.

 4. Maintenance, Security and Operation.

 4.1 Maintenance. The Parties anticipate the Park will be among the more heavily used in the City. The City, through its Department of Parks and Recreation, will maintain and operate the completed park to a standard consistent with the maintenance and operation of other highly utilized parks such as Greenlake and Volunteer Park. Any additional funds for South Lake Union Park maintenance, improvements or enhancements of any sort raised by the Foundation or provided by South Lake Union area property owners directly or through any City- sponsored or sanctioned neighborhood mechanism will be used to enhance the level of maintenance of the Park and may not be used to reduce or displace basic City funding and other support for the Park's maintenance and operation by the City consistent with this standard. In addition, the City specifically agrees that mechanical and electronic displays or components and water features, including fountains and the model boat pond that are the responsibility of the City, will be maintained to permit continuous operation as designed, and operated in accordance with their respective operating manuals and consistent with Park operating hours and policies including seasonal constraints.

 4.2 Security. The City, consistent with City policies, will provide reasonable security at the Park appropriate for its intended use as a safe, family-oriented urban public space.

 4.3 Operation. Not later than six (6) months prior to the completion of Construction Phase 2 of the Park, the Superintendent of Parks will prepare an Operation and Maintenance Plan for the Park. This plan will be consistent with the requirements of this Agreement and is subject to the review of the Foundation, as are any subsequent material modifications to it. The City Parks Department will operate and maintain the Park consistent with this Agreement and the Operation and Maintenance Plan.

 5. Ancillary Projects.

 5.1 Armory. Occupying a prominent site within the Park, the City-owned Armory remains an important asset with considerable potential for enhancing the Park. At present, the Armory is underutilized and in need of substantial capital improvements. The City will work in good faith to make needed improvements to the Armory. Future uses in the Armory may include food service, retail, and exhibit spaces that relate to and appropriately enhance the park experience. In consultation with the Foundation, the City will prepare a long-term plan for the Armory under which the Armory will realize its potential as a community facility functioning as an integral component and reinforcing the overall viability of the Park. The City will review the plan with the Foundation and keep it apprised of any actions related to improvements to or major change in uses of the Armory.

 6. Naming Rights. The Foundation will comply with applicable Parks Department naming policies (attached as Exhibit _D_). In addition, the Superintendent will work with the Foundation to identify specific naming opportunities and any conditions unique to South Lake Union Park. Such unique opportunities and conditions will be subject to review by the Board of Park Commissioners and reflected in a separate letter of agreement between the Foundation and the Parks Department. The overall efforts of the Foundation in securing funds for the Park will be acknowledged in an appropriate manner on signage placed at the entrance of the Park.

 7. Term of Agreement. This Agreement will terminate the earlier of five (5) years after substantial completion of the Phase 2 construction or ten (10) years after notice to proceed is given for Phase 1 construction, whichever is sooner; provided, however, the City's maintenance, security and operation obligations under Section 4 shall terminate twenty-five (25) years after substantial completion.

 8. Force Majeure. Neither party hereto shall be liable to the other party for any nonperformance, in whole or in part, of its obligations under this Agreement caused by the occurrence of any contingencies beyond the reasonable control of the parties, including but not limited to declared or undeclared war, sabotage, insurrection, riot, or other acts of civil disobedience, acts of a public enemy, acts or decrees of governments or agencies affecting the terms of this Agreement, strikes, labor disputes, acts of third parties not within the control of the party whose performance is affected, shortages of fuel, failures of power, accidents, fires, explosions, floods or other acts of Force Majeure.

 9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior agreement or understanding among the Parties with respect to such subject matter.

 10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such provision to any party or circumstance shall be invalid, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such provision to other parties or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

 11. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, consents and other communications required or permitted to be given by this Agreement shall be in writing and personally delivered or mailed to the other party. Such notices shall be deemed received at the earlier of (a) the date actually received; or (b) three (3) business days after such mailing. Such notices shall be sent to the Parties at the following

 12. Assignment; Subcontract. The Parties shall not assign any of their rights or delegate any of their obligations under this Agreement to a third party without the prior written approval of the other party.

 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute one in the same instrument.

 14. Headings. The article and section headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provisions hereof.

 15. Construction. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Washington without regard to any otherwise governing principals of conflicts of laws. This Agreement shall be construed neutrally and not in favor or against any party.

 16. Equal Employment Opportunity and Outreach.

 16.1. The Foundation shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap, unless based upon a bona

 fide occupational qualification. The Foundation shall take affirmative efforts to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. Such efforts shall include, but not be limited to the following: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

 16.2. The Foundation, by executing this Agreement, is affirming that the Foundation complies with all applicable federal, state, and local non-discrimination laws, particularly the requirements of SMC Ch. 20.42 as incorporated in this Agreement. Any violation of the mandatory requirements of the provisions of this section shall be a material breach of Agreement for which the Foundation may be subject to damages and sanctions provided for by the Agreement and by applicable law, including but not limited to debarment from City contracting activities in accordance with SMC Ch. 20.70.

 5.3 Parks and Recreation Facilities - all properties and facilities in the park and recreation system of the City under ownership, management and/or control of Seattle Parks and Recreation.

 6.0 RESPONSIBILITY:

 6.1 The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, with the advice of the board of Park Commissioners, is authorized to designate the names of parks and recreation facilities from names submitted for consideration the Seattle Parks and Recreation Naming Committee, of which he is a member.

 6.2 The Seattle Parks and Recreation Naming Committee is authorized to establish criteria and procedures to be followed in selecting names to be submitted to the Superintendent.

 7.0 PROCEDURES:

 7.1 The Seattle Parks and Recreation Naming Committee will meet as necessary and may elect its own Chair. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation will provide staff support.

 7.2 The Naming Committee will use the media and appropriate signage to solicit suggestions for names from organizations and individuals. The Committee will acknowledge and record for consideration all suggestions, solicited or not.

 7.3 After considering the names and applying the criteria set forth in 7.5 below, the Committee will recommend names to the Superintendent, and provide the historical or other supportive information as appropriate to justify the recommendations.

 7.4 The Superintendent, with the advice of the Board of Park Commissioners, has final authority to designate names for parks and recreation facilities. Upon designating a name for a park or recreation facility, the Superintendent will, within ten days, notify the Mayor and the Chair of the city Council committee dealing with parks and recreation matters, and will file the name designation with the office of the City Clerk, at which time the name will become official.

 7.5 CRITERIA:

 7.5.1. To avoid duplication, confusing similarity, or inappropriateness, the Committee, in considering name suggestions, will review existing park and facility names in the park system.

 7.5.2. In naming a park or facility, the Committee will consider geographical location, historical or cultural significance, distinctive natural or geological features, and the wishes of the community in which it is located.

 7.5.3. In naming community centers and other facilities, the committee will give considerable weight to the names that reflect the geographic location that gives identity to the community.

 7.5.4. Parks and recreation facilities may be named for a person subject to the following conditions: the person must have been deceased for a minimum of three years, and the person must have made a significant positive contribution to parks, recreation, or culture in the community where the facility is located. The City will bear the cost of the plaque or monument indicating the name of the individual for whom the facility is named.

 7.5.5. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation may accept or reject the Naming Committee's recommendation.

 7.5.6. As a general rule, portions of a park or recreation facility will not have a name other than that of the entire facility. The Committee may consider exceptions in cases where, as a revenue or fundraising opportunity, a nomination is submitted to name a room within a community center after a corporate sponsor or in cases where an area within a park is distinctive enough, in the view of the Committee, to merit its own name.

 7.5.7. Because temporary "working" designations tend to be retained, the Superintendent will carry out the naming process for a new park facility as early as possible after its acquisition or development. Facilities will bear number designations until the naming process results in adoption of a name.

 7.5.8. A name, once bestowed, is permanent.
