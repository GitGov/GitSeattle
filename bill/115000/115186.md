 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the West Seattle Junction Parking and Business Improvement Area; increasing the assessment rates, and amending Ordinance 113326, as previously amended by Ordinances 119539 and 120570, in accordance therewith.

 WHEREAS, in 1987, through Ordinance 113326, the City established the West Seattle Junction Parking and Business Improvement Area (PBIA), providing for the levy of special assessments upon businesses within the PBIA for the purpose of enhancing conditions for operation of those businesses; and

 WHEREAS, in 1999, the City passed Ordinance 119539, increasing the original assessment rates for the PBIA, and there has been no subsequent increase in the assessment rates; and

 WHEREAS, on March 17, 2004, the ratepayer advisory board for the West Seattle Junction Association, which oversees the PBIA, voted to increase parking assessment rates by 25% and all other assessment rates by 10%, for the purpose of preventing reduction in services due to inflation in prices; and

 WHEREAS, on ___________________, 2005, in accordance with RCW 35.87A.140, the City Council held a public hearing regarding its intention to raise the West Seattle PBIA's assessment rates; NOW, THEREFORE,
