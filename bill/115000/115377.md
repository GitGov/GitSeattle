 The GRANTOR, without consideration, does hereby REMISE, RELEASE AND FOREVER QUIT CLAIM unto the GRANTEE, its successors and assigns, all its right, title, and interest in the property situated, lying and being in the County of King, in the State of Washington, containing approximately 11.92 acres, and legally described as:

 SUBJECT TO all valid and existing restrictions, reservations, covenants, conditions, and easements, including but not limited to rights-of-way for railroads, highways, pipelines, and public utilities, if any, whether of public record or not.

 TO HAVE AND HOLD the property granted herein to the GRANTEE and its successors and assigns, together with all and singular the appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anyway appertaining, and all the estate, right, title, interest, or claim whatsoever of the GRANTOR, either in law or in equity and subject to the terms, reservations, restrictions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Deed.

 RESERVING unto the GRANTOR, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the State of Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) and their officers, agents, employees, contractors, and subcontractors, a perpetual and assignable right of access in, on, over, and through the Property, in any case in which an environmental response action or corrective action is found to be necessary, or such access and entrance is necessary to carry out a response action or corrective action on adjoining property; including, without limitation, the right to perform any additional environmental investigation, monitoring, sampling, testing, response action, corrective action, or any other action necessary for the GRANTOR to meet its responsibilities under applicable laws and as provided for in this Deed including the right:

 4. To construct, operate, maintain, or undertake any other response or remedial actions as required or necessary including, but not limited to monitoring wells, pumping wells, and treatment facilities.

 This right of access shall be binding on the GRANTEE, its successors, and assigns, and shall be a binding servitude on the Property herein conveyed and shall be deemed to run with the land in perpetuity. This reservation includes the right to access and use utilities on the Property at reasonable cost to the United States. In exercising this right of access, the GRANTOR shall give the GRANTEE or the then record owner, reasonable notice of the intent to enter on the Property, except in emergency situations. GRANTOR shall use reasonable means, without significant additional cost to the GRANTOR, to avoid and/or minimize interference with the use of the Property. The GRANTEE or the then record owner(s) of the Property, and any other person shall have no claim against the GRANTOR or any officer, employee or contractors thereof solely on account of any such interference resulting from actions taken under the Environmental Protection Provisions.

 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROVISIONS

 Inclusion of Provisions:

 The GRANTEE shall neither transfer the property, lease the property, nor grant any interest, privilege, or license whatsoever in connection with the property without the inclusion of the Environmental Protection Provisions contained herein, and shall require the inclusion of such Environmental Protection Provisions in all further deeds, easements, transfers, leases or grants of any interest, privilege, or license.

 CERCLA Notice and Covenant:

 IT IS FURTHER AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD by and between the parties hereto that the GRANTEE covenants and agrees for itself, its successors and assigns, forever, that this Deed is made and accepted upon each of the following covenants, which covenants shall be binding upon and enforceable against the GRANTEE, its successors and assigns, in perpetuity; and that the notices, covenants, and restrictions set forth here are a binding servitude on the Property herein conveyed and shall be deemed to run with the land in perpetuity:

 1. The covenant under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, "CERCLA" 120(h)(3)(A)(ii)(I) warranting that all remedial action under CERCLA, necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to hazardous substances remaining on the property has been taken before the date of transfer;

 2. The covenant under CERCLA 120(h)(3)(A)(ii)(II) warranting that any remedial action under CERCLA found to be necessary after the date of transfer with respect to such hazardous substances remaining on the property shall be conducted by the United States; and,

 3. The clause as required by CERCLA 120 (h)(3)(A)(iii) granting the United States access to the property in any case in which remedial action or corrective action is found to be necessary after the date of transfer.

 No Liability for Non-Army Contamination:

 The United States shall not incur liability for additional response action or corrective action, found to be necessary after the date of transfer, in any case in which the person or entity to whom the property is transferred, or other non-Army entities, is identified as the party responsible for contamination of the property.

 Disturbance of Soils and Hydrology Restrictions:

 A. Restrictions and Conditions. The following restrictions and conditions apply to the northeast portion of the Property where petroleum-contaminated subsurface soils have been left in place as legally described on Exhibit B. The Grantee covenants for itself, its successors, and assigns not to: (a) advance soil borings into the subsurface deeper than 14 feet below ground surface or (b) install groundwater wells. For the purpose of this restriction, "groundwater" shall have the same meaning as in Section 101(12) of CERCLA. The Grantee, for itself, its successors or assigns covenants that it will not undertake nor allow any activity on or use of the Property that would violate the restrictions contained herein. These restrictions and covenants are binding on the Grantee, its successors and assigns; shall run with the land; and are forever enforceable.

 B. Enforcement. The restrictions and conditions stated in Section A benefit the public in general and the territory surrounding the Property, including lands retained by the United States, and therefore, are enforceable by the United States government. The Grantee covenants for itself, its successors, and assigns that it shall include and otherwise make legally binding, the restrictions in Section A in all subsequent lease, transfer, or conveyance documents relating to the Property subject hereto.

 Notice of UXO Clearance:

 Based upon a review of existing records and available information, none of the buildings and/or land proposed for transfer is known to contain unexploded ordnance (UXO). In the event that the Grantee, its successors, and assigns, should discover any ordnance on the Property it shall not attempt to remove or destroy it but shall immediately notify the local Police Department and GRANTOR. Designated explosive ordnance personnel will be dispatched promptly by GRANTOR to dispose of such ordnance at no expense to the GRANTEE.

 NON-DISCRIMINATION

 The GRANTEE covenants for itself, its heirs, successors, and assigns and every successor in interest to the property hereby conveyed, or any part thereof, that the said GRANTEE and such heirs, successors, and assigns shall not discriminate upon the basis of race, color, religion, age, gender, or national origin in the use, occupancy, sale, or lease of the property, or in their employment practices conducted thereon. This covenant shall not apply, however, to the lease or rental of a room or rooms within a family dwelling unit; nor shall it apply with respect to religion to premises used primarily for religious purposes. The United States of America shall be deemed a beneficiary of this covenant without regard to whether it remains the owner of any land or interest therein in the locality of the property hereby conveyed and shall have the sole right to enforce this covenant in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 "AS IS"

 The GRANTEE has inspected, knows and accepts the condition and state of repair of the subject Property. The GRANTEE understands and agrees that the Property and any part thereof is offered "AS IS" without any representation, warranty or guaranty by the GRANTOR as to quantity, quality, title, character, condition, size, or kind, or that the same is in condition or fit to be used for the purpose(s) intended by the GRANTEE, and no claim for allowance or deduction upon such grounds will be considered.

 HOLD HARMLESS

 To the extent authorized by law, the GRANTEE, on behalf of itself, its successors, and assigns, covenants and agrees to hold harmless the GRANTOR, its officers, agents, and employees from any and all claims, damages, judgments, loss and costs, including fines and penalties, arising out of the violation of the notices, use restrictions, and restrictive covenants in this Deed; and the GRANTOR shall not be responsible for any costs associated with activity under a conditional exception, amendment, or as an exception to the Grant or change in activity or use, including, without limitation, costs associated with any additional investigation or remediation.

 ANTI-DEFICIENCY ACT CLAUSE

 The GRANTOR'S obligation to pay or reimburse any money under this Deed is subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this purpose to the Department of the Army; and nothing in this Deed shall be interpreted to require obligations or payments by the GRANTOR in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 1341.

 NO WAIVER

 The failure of the Government to insist in any one or more instances upon complete performance of any of the said notices, covenants, conditions, restrictions, or reservations shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of the future performance of any such covenants, conditions, restrictions, or reservations; but the obligations of the GRANTEE, its successors and assigns, with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and effect.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA has caused these presents to be executed in its name by the Secretary of the Army, and the seal of the Department of the Army to be affixed hereto this ____day of _________________, 200___.
