 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Department of Executive Administration to close the Police Support Facility Subfund of the General Fund; transferring all unexpended balances; and abandoning unexpended and unencumbered appropriation authority.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118292 created the Police Support Facility Subfund of the General Fund for deposit of revenues from, and payment of expenses for, 2203 Airport Way South, commonly known as Park 90/5; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30379 adopted City policies to terminate the Police Support Facility Subfund of the General Fund once the City's occupancy of the facility had stabilized and reasonable allowances had been made for integrating the facility's costs and revenues into the budget and rate setting cycle of the following biennium and, upon termination, to account for the costs and revenues associated with the facilities in the same manner as is used for other City buildings; and

 WHEREAS, the capital projects necessary to provide workspace and storage space for the Seattle Police Department and other City and private tenants of the Police Support Facility are substantially complete; and

 WHEREAS the Park 90/5 complex is now mostly occupied by City departments; and

 WHEREAS the transition from private tenancy to City occupancy eliminates the value of tracking Police Support Facility revenues and expenses in a separate subfund; and

 WHEREAS the 2005 and 2006 Proposed Budget provides for the integration of the Park 90/5 complex's costs and revenues into the budget of, and rate setting process for, the Fleets and Facilities Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the operational responsibilities supported by the Police Support Facility Subfund are currently, and will continue to be, handled by the Fleets and Facilities Department; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Police Support Facility Subfund of the General Fund established by Ordinance 118292 (Subfund 00180) is closed and eliminated, effective January 1, 2005.

 Section 2. All remaining assets and liabilities of the Police Support Facility Subfund shall be transferred to the Facilities Services Subfund (50330) of the Fleets and Facilities Fund.

 Section 4. All remaining unexpended and unencumbered appropriation authority within the Police Support Facility Subfund shall be abandoned.

 Section 5. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.
