 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Department of Executive Administration to close the Key Tower Operating Subfund of the General Fund; transferring that subfund's assets and liabilities; abandoning unexpended and unencumbered appropriation authority, and repealing Section 4 of Ordinance 118081.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118081 created the City Hall Subfund of the General Fund for deposit of revenues from and payment of expenses for the Key Tower; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118081 provided in Section 4 that "The City Hall Subfund shall make periodic payments to the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund in amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on all debt incurred by the City for acquisition of, or enhancements to, Key Tower as such payments become due;" and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120165 renamed the City Hall Subfund to the Key Tower Operating Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30379 adopted City policies to terminate the Key Tower Operating Subfund of the General Fund once the City's occupancy of the facility had stabilized and reasonable allowances had been made for integrating the facility's costs and revenues into the budget and rate setting cycle of the following biennium and, upon termination, to account for the costs and revenues associated with the facilities in the same manner as is used for other City buildings; and

 WHEREAS, the Key Tower was renamed Seattle Municipal Tower on May 17, 2004, reflecting its substantial transition from occupancy by private tenants to occupancy by City departments; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Municipal Tower is now occupied mostly by City departments; and

 WHEREAS, the transition from private tenancy to City occupancy eliminates the value of tracking Seattle Municipal Tower revenues and expenses in a separate subfund; and

 WHEREAS, the operational responsibilities supported by the Key Tower Operating Subfund are currently, and will continue to be, handled by the Fleets and Facilities Department; and

 WHEREAS, the 2005 and 2006 Proposed Budgets provide for the integration of Seattle Municipal Tower operating costs and revenues into the budget of, and rate setting process for, the Fleets and Facilities Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the 2005 and 2006 Proposed Budgets provide for payment of principal of and interest on capital debt related to the Seattle Municipal Tower through allocation charges to certain departments occupying space in that facility; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Key Tower Operating Subfund of the General Fund established by Ordinance 118081 (Subfund 00170) is closed and eliminated, effective January 1, 2005.

 Section 2. All remaining assets and liabilities of the Key Tower Operating Subfund shall be transferred to the Facilities Services Subfund (50330) of the Fleets and Facilities Fund effective January 1, 2005.

 Section 3. All remaining encumbered appropriation authority within the Key Tower Operating Subfund shall be transferred to the Facilities Subfund (50330) of the Fleets and Facilities Fund effective January 1, 2005.

 Section 4. All remaining unexpended and unencumbered appropriation authority within the Key Tower Operating Subfund as of January 1, 2005, is abandoned.

 Section 5. Section 4 of Ordinance 118081 is repealed effective January 1, 2005.

 Section 6. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
