 Project Descriptions:

 City of Seattle - 315422 Uptown Park (Queen Anne and Roy)

 This is a .28-acre open space located at the base of Queen Anne Hill at the corner of Queen Anne Avenue and Roy Street. It will become a passive neighborhood greenspace that will serve this high-density community at the northern end of Downtown Seattle. To help address street traffic noise, Seattle intends to create a physical sound buffer, such as an earth berm.

 City of Seattle - 315423 Urban Center Park (East Capitol Hill)

 This neighborhood greenspace project will serve the Capitol Hill urban center. There are three possible acquisition sites; two are located near Thomas Street at 16th Avenue and one is located on 13th Avenue near Harrison Street.

 City of Seattle - 315424 Urban Center Park (International District)

 This project consists of the acquisition of land for urban green space in the Chinatown-International District urban center in Seattle. The City of Seattle (Seattle) has identified several candidate sites, but it has not selected a final site. Contingency: Seattle will propose a final site location to the Conservation Futures Citizens Committee and King County for approval before CFL funds are disbursed to Seattle for this project.

 City of Seattle - 315404 Thornton Creek Park 2 Addition

 This project consists of the acquisition of open space along Thornton Creek at Northeast 100th Street in northeast Seattle. The property is an inholding that will add to the existing Thornton Creek Park stream system and greenbelt. This project will benefit salmonid species, wildlife, and avian species and allow for habitat restoration and environmental education.
