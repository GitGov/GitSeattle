 Solid Waste Facility Master Plan -- Intermodal Transport Facility

 BCL/Program Name: New Facilities BCL/Program Code: C230B ..Project Type: New Facility Start Date: 1st Quarter 2006 End Date: 4th Quarter 2007 Project ID: C207004 Location: Neighborhood Plan: In more than one Plan Neighborhood Plan Multiple Neighborhood In more than one District Urban In more than one Urban Village

 This project formerly implemented the Solid Waste Facilities Master Plan by planning, designing and building a new solid waste intermodal transfer facility. In the wake of the "Seattle Solid Waste Recycling, Waste Reduction and Facilities Opportunities" report, the Executive, Council and SPU decided not to build an intermodal facility but to proceed with other elements of the master plan. Remaining project budget in 2007 supports planning to date, including costs for the study, and close-out activities.
