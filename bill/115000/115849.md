 AGREEMENT

 SEATTLE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION, IAFF, LOCAL NO. 2898

 AFL - CIO - CLC

 PREAMBLE

 The rules contained herein constitute an Agreement between the City of Seattle, hereinafter referred to as the "City" or the "Employer" and the Seattle Fire Chiefs Association, I.A.F.F., Local Union No. 2898, hereinafter referred to as the "Union," governing wages, hours, and working conditions as described herein.

 The City and the Union agree that the purpose of this Agreement is to provide for fair and reasonable compensation and working conditions for employees of the City as enumerated in this Agreement and to provide for the efficient and uninterrupted performance of municipal functions. This Agreement has been reached through the process of collective bargaining with the objective of serving the aforementioned purposes and with the further objective of fostering effective cooperation between the City and its employees.

 ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION AND BARGAINING UNIT

 1.1 The City hereby recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the bargaining unit of all supervisory uniformed personnel of the Fire Department holding the rank of Battalion Chief and Deputy Chief.

 ARTICLE 2 - UNION MEMBERSHIP

 2.1 Each regular full-time employee promoted into the bargaining unit shall make application to become a member of the Union within thirty (30) days following the date of employment within the unit, and all other employees within the bargaining unit who have voluntarily become members of the Union shall maintain such membership in good standing, and failure by any such employee to apply for and/or maintain such membership in accordance with this provision shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided that it is expressly understood and agreed that the discharge of employees is governed by applicable provisions of the City Charter, which provisions are paramount and shall prevail; provided further that the above requirements to apply for Union membership and/or maintain Union membership shall be satisfied by an offer by the employee to pay the regular dues uniformly required by the Union of its members in municipal employment. The Union will administer the provisions of this Article with regard to membership or association of employees in accord with its obligations under the law.

 When an employee fails to fulfill the above obligation, the Union shall provide the employee and the Employer with thirty (30) calendar days written notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action.

 Any disputes concerning the amount of dues or fees and/or the responsibility of the Union to the employees covered by this Agreement shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement.

 Employees who satisfy the religious exemption requirements of RCW 41.56.122 shall contribute an amount equivalent to regular Union dues to a nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such employee would otherwise pay the regular monthly dues.

 The employee shall furnish written proof that such payment has been made. If the employee and the bargaining representative do not reach agreement on such matter, the Public Employment Relations Commission shall designate the charitable organization.

 2.2 There shall be no discrimination by the City against any employee on account of membership status, or union activity

 2.3 The City shall make deductions on a regular basis from an employee's pay for the regular Union dues or other obligation agreed between the employee and the Union; provided such employees shall authorize said deductions in writing on a form to be filed with the City. The City shall remit such deductions to the Union. The performance of this function is recognized as a service to the Union by the Employer.

 2.4 The Union recognizes that it is the Union's exclusive responsibility to notify employees of their options regarding association and/or membership. The Union agrees to indemnify and save harmless the employer from any and all liability arising out of this Article.

 ARTICLE 3 - SALARIES

 3.1 The minimum salaries to be paid by the City to employees in the bargaining unit during the period of this Agreement are set forth in Appendix A of this Agreement.

 3.2 The hourly rate of pay for employees shall be determined as follows:

 99.25 shifts X 24 hours = 2382 Annual hours

 Monthly salary X 12 = Annual salary

 Annual salary ? 2382 = Hourly rate

 Hourly rate X 91.4 = Biweekly rate

 or, for 40 hour employees:

 Monthly salary X 12 = Annual salary

 Annual salary ? 2088 = Hourly rate

 3.3 Employees who work, or are otherwise entitled to pay, for all scheduled shifts in a work schedule that averages 45.7 hours per week on an annual basis shall be paid for 91.4 hours a pay period regardless of the number of hours actually worked. The bi-weekly pay of employees who are absent from scheduled work and are in a non-pay status for less than two shifts during the pay period shall be computed by subtracting the number of hours absent from 91.4 and multiplying by the hourly rate of pay. When unpaid absence equals two or more scheduled working shifts in one pay period, payment will be made only for time worked.

 3.4 When an employee's number of actual hours worked is affected by Daylight Savings Time adjustments, the employee shall not be compensated for any additional time worked as a result of said adjustments, nor shall his/her compensation be reduced for working less time as a result of said adjustments.

 3.5 In the event an employee covered by this Agreement leaves the service of the Fire Department and within a year the Fire Department rehires said employee in the same classification to which assigned at date of termination, such employee shall be placed at the step in the salary range which is closest to the salary earned at the time of the original termination.

 3.6 Upon promotion to a position in the bargaining unit, an employee previously in a position classified as Captain shall be granted service credit for work in an out of class basis in the position to which promoted if the conditions below are met. Similarly, upon promotion to a Deputy Chief position in the bargaining unit, an employee previously in a Battalion Chief position shall be granted service credit for work in an out of class basis in a Deputy Chief position if the following conditions are met:

 1. The higher level position to which the employee is promoted is in the same Fire Department unit (Operations, FAC, FMO, Paramedics) in which the out of class assignment was worked.

 2. The out of class assignment continued for at least six (6) consecutive months immediately prior to the promotion. (The "consecutive months" will be considered to have been interrupted if the employee was absent from duty for any reason for a total of eight or more shifts.)

 ARTICLE 4 - HOURS OF DUTY

 4.1 The number of hours assigned duty per week for employees under this Agreement shall be continued in accordance with provisions as set forth in this Agreement. Nothing herein shall limit the City in exercising discretion in varying the hours of duty of any employee. Employees working an average work week of 45.7 hours shall work a base schedule of a twenty-four (24) hour shift. Employees assigned to other divisions shall work forty (40) hours per /week.

 4.2 Employees in the Operations Division may work a maximum of two consecutive 24-hour shifts provided that such a work assignment does not affect the employees' ability to safely perform their duties on the job and that the employees have not worked another two consecutive 24-shifts earlier in that month.

 4.3 The City and the Union may open negotiations on Article 4.2 in the event that there is evidence of a pattern that two consecutive 24- hour shifts are causing harm to the safety of Fire Personnel.

 4.4 Employees will have twenty-four (24) hours off duty before and after a change of schedule to or from Operations and Administrative schedules.

 4.5 Upon mutual agreement of the Department and the employee, the Department may divide and reschedule an employee's debit shifts to accommodate training, assignment as Supervising Chief or other special Department needs. Each instance whereby hours of a debit shift are divided and rescheduled by mutual agreement, shall be considered on its own and shall not set a precedent for future such agreements.

 4.6 The City agrees to a Special Relief program for all employees covered by this Agreement. Early or Late Relief shall be permitted on a position by position basis subject to approval by the Employer.

 4.7 Floating debit shifts scheduled but not worked due to disability shall not be rescheduled at a later date.

 4.8.1 Employees shall work, in addition to the regularly scheduled twenty-four (24) hour shifts, four (4) scheduled and four (4) floating debit shifts per year to result in an average 45.7-hour work week. Employees may cancel owed debit shifts, upon approval of the Chief, with accrued vacation, holiday hours or accrued compensatory time. It is expected, however, that most debit shifts shall be worked. (Accrued vacation for purposes of this Article shall mean the vacation amount due that year and may include accumulated or saved vacation.)

 The amount of debit shift time owed by an employee at any point during the year may be computed as two and one-tenth (2.1) hours per each scheduled twenty-four (24) hour shift. That figure is derived as follows:

 Current Hours

 There are 91 scheduled shifts

 There are 8 debit shifts

 8 ? 91 = .088 (partial hour owed per hour worked)

 .088 x 24 = 2.1 (hours owed per scheduled shift)

 4.8.2 Debit shift time owed per scheduled shift will not be accrued for scheduled twenty-four (24) hour shifts which are not worked due to:

 a) Detail to other than a 24-hour shift schedule rotation.

 b) Participation in a training program for one (1) full shift or more. If the training program was requested by the employee and not a program offered or encouraged for attendance by the Department, this exception shall not be allowed.

 c) Disability leave paid for one full shift or more by LEOFF I or sick leave Benefits or without pay.

 4.8.3 An annual accounting of debit shifts shall be made at the end of the calendar year. If the provisions of 4.5.4, 4.5.5 or 4.5.6 apply and an employee either owes or is owed debit shift time, the appropriate adjustment in compensation will occur in the third pay period of the new year. The above is conditioned on employees completing and forwarding Form 33 immediately after the occurrence of each event which impacts their debit shifts.

 4.8.4 At the time of the annual accounting or upon separation from employment, including retirement, debit shift time owed by the employee will be charged against, at the employee's choice, accrued compensatory, vacation or holiday time. Debit shift time worked over the amount owed will be credited back to the employee per Section 5.2.1 of Article 5.

 4.8.5 If the employee owes debit time in less than a full shift of twenty-four (24) hours, the employee may be allowed to work a partial shift; work a shift to include the debit time plus additional hours which shall be compensated for pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.2.1 of Article 5; or cancel same as provided in 4.5.4.

 4.8.6 If, at year end, it is determined that an employee has not worked all debit time owed and has been paid for a shift of overtime pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.2.1, the debit hours owed shall be charged against the employee's accrued vacation, or compensatory time at the rate the employee was compensated for the overtime hours.

 ARTICLE 5 - OVERTIME PAY

 5.1.1 Work performed outside of the employee's regular scheduled shift(s) shall be compensated (pay or compensatory time) at the overtime rate of time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for actual hours worked. All non-emergency overtime work must be approved by the employee's immediate supervisor.

 5.1.2 All overtime compensation shall be at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2). Such overtime compensation shall be in the form of pay or employees may receive compensatory time at the overtime rate in lieu of overtime pay upon approval of the Chief of the Department. Any overtime earned after the Fair Labor Standards Act threshold of 212 hours in a twenty-eight (28) day work period shall be in the form of pay in all cases. The FLSA period shall begin on the first day of a pay period, with the beginning on June 14, 1995. The overtime rate of pay shall be determined from the applicable straight time hourly rate. Additionally, overtime worked pursuant to reimbursable activity shall be compensated at the overtime rate in the form of pay and shall not be taken as compensatory time.

 5.2.1 Employees called out, while off duty, on a multiple alarm or other emergency shall be credited with a minimum of four (4) hours of overtime for such call out and shall be paid at time and one-half the straight time hourly rate of pay for all hours worked.

 5.2.2 Employees called back to work at the request of the Chief for disciplinary hearings, ordered to appear in court on Department business, or returned to duty on other Department business on their regular time off shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half times their hourly rate with a minimum of four (4) hours of overtime for such call out.

 5.2.3 Employees shall not be entitled to work full-shift overtime in any given quarter of the year without first having worked at least one (1) debit shift in that quarter, assuming that all debits for the year have not been worked already.

 5.3.1 Vacancies (all absences of more than 12 hours) occurring in the Battalion and Deputy Chief ranks in the Operations Division not covered by a member working a debit shift shall be filled by those Battalion/Deputy Chiefs in the bargaining unit who have volunteered for overtime assignments to ensure that there are at least six chiefs on duty. Long-term acting battalion chiefs will not be assigned until after the first eight continuous shifts of a battalion chief's absence. Specialty unit positions shall be filled prior to determining whether the Department is in an overtime hiring mode. Full time shift overtime shall not apply to displace Captains who are working in long term out of class assignments as Battalion Chiefs.

 5.3.2 Employees shall be hired for overtime from a voluntary overtime signup list. If those Chiefs on the log are not available, the Department may fill such overtime positions as its policy and procedure may provide. "Availability" shall be determined by one phone call to the number provided by the employee on the overtime log. Long distance calls shall be at the employee's expense. Employees shall be scheduled and called for overtime work in such a manner as will, so far as practicable, rotate overtime work opportunities among employees covered by this Agreement. Vacant positions shall be filled first by employees holding the rank of the vacant position(s). If no employee holding the rank of the vacant position is available, the Department shall hire any employee of the bargaining unit who has signed up to work. If more than one employee has signed up to work overtime, the member with the least number of previously worked overtime hours shall be hired.

 5.3.3 The Union shall be granted access to the Department's full shift overtime log specified in 5.3.1.

 9.5.4 An employee working a regularly scheduled shift may take the whole shift off if necessary but shall not be paid for more than 12 hours in any one calendar year. In the event that the emergency situation requires the employee's presence for more than 12 hours, the employee shall have the option of utilizing one of the following to offset any hours beyond twelve:

 a. Holiday time

 b. Vacation time

 c. Compensatory time

 9.5.5 An employee who is working on an overtime basis will be allowed to leave work in an emergency such as described above, but will be paid only for hours actually worked.

 9.6 The City agrees to allow the remaining portions of an employee's vacation, accumulated vacation days, holidays, or accumulated compensatory time to be used as Sickness and Death in Family Leave, as provided in 9.1 and 9.2.

 10.2 Whenever an employee is notified of a detail to another assignment location during his/her off-duty time, the member shall receive thirty (30) minutes of pay at time and one-half (1 1/2).

 10.3 If an employee is detailed to another station after reporting to his/her scheduled place of employment, he/she may use his/her private automobile to effect the detail if Department transportation is not furnished.

Such a dispute shall be processed in accordance with this Article. Any other type of dispute between the parties as well as disputes involving (1) Public Safety Civil Service Commission Rules or Regulations whether specified in this Agreement or not, if there be such, (2) disciplinary/discharge action taken by the Employer, except as specified in 12.10 and Article 13; and (3) Article 24 - Pensions, shall not be subject to the procedure delineated in this Article.

 Early Mediation Process. The City and the Fire Chiefs' Association encourage the use of the Early Mediation Process prior to issues becoming the subject of grievances. Participation in the process is entirely voluntary, confidential and does not impact grievance rights

 Any alleged grievance shall be taken up by the employee with the appropriate Deputy Chief within ten (10) calendar days of the occurrence. If the aggrieved employee is a Deputy Chief, the grievance shall be taken up by the employee with their Assistant Chief. The above parties agree to make every effort to settle the grievance at this stage promptly; however, if no satisfactory settlement is reached, the following procedure shall apply:

 Step 1. The grievance shall be reduced to written form by the aggrieved employee and/or Union, stating the section of the Agreement allegedly violated and explaining the grievance in detail. The Union Representative shall present the written grievance to the Assistant Chief of the Department within ten (10) calendar days after the alleged grievance is taken up by the employee with the Deputy Chief or the Assistant Chief. The Assistant Chief or his/her designee shall convene a meeting within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the written grievance, between the Union Representative, aggrieved employee, and any other witnesses and/or members of management whose presence is deemed necessary to a fair consideration of the grievance.

 Ten (10) calendar days after the aforementioned meeting, the Assistant Chief shall transmit a copy of this decision to the aggrieved employee, the Union and the Chief of the Fire Department.

 Step 2. A grievance which remains unresolved after the written decision is delivered in Step One shall be transmitted in writing by the aggrieved employee and/or Union involved to the Chief of the Fire Department with a copy to the Director of Labor Relations. Said transmittal must be accompanied by the following information:

 (a) Nature of dispute

 (b) Contract provision(s) allegedly violated

A grievance properly filed shall be investigated by the Chief of the Department and/or the City Labor Relations Director or their respective designees. Such investigation, if deemed appropriate by the Chief of the Fire Department, may include a conference with the employee involved and his/her Union representative, if he/she has designated one. The Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may thereafter make a confidential recommendation to the Chief of the Fire Department. The Chief of the Department shall make a decision on the matter in writing within ten (10) calendar days from the date when it was first received by him/her; provided, however, the Chief of the Department may waive investigating and answering the grievance at Step 2 and defer a decision to Step 3 within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the grievance. Copies of the Chief's decision shall be furnished to the aggrieved, his/her Union representative and the Director of Labor Relations.

 Step 3. A grievance which remains unresolved after the decision is rendered in Step 2 may be transmitted in writing to the Director of Labor Relations by the aggrieved employee and/or Union, requesting a review by the Grievance Board, or submitted to Step 4 as provided by 12.11. The Grievance Board shall not be required to consider a grievance which is not referred to the Director of Labor Relations within ten (10) calendar days following written notification of the Step 2 decision.

The Chief shall within ten (10) calendar days thereafter render a decision on the issue with a copy to Local 2898, the aggrieved employee and the Director of Labor Relations.

 Step 4. If the contract grievance is not settled in Step 2 or 3, it may be referred by either the Union or the City to the Washington State Public Employment Relations Commission to supply both parties with a list of five (5) qualified arbitrators. If no agreement is reached between parties in the choice of an arbitrator from that list within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of said list, or the Union or the City opt to bypass a PERC list of arbitrators, the contract grievance shall be referred to the American Arbitration Association for arbitration to be conducted under its voluntary labor arbitration regulations.

 Referral to arbitration (PERC or AAA) must be made within thirty (30) calendar days after the decision in Step 3 and to be accompanied by the following information:

 (a) Identification of the section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated.

 12.2 In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood as follows:

 (a) The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from, or alter, change, or modify the terms of this Agreement, and his power shall be limited to interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement, and all other matters shall be excluded from arbitration.

 (b) The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the City, the Union, and the employees involved.

 (c) The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union, and each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case.

 12.5 The City agrees to conduct all hearings concerning a grievance on on-duty hours of employees whenever practical.

 12.11 If the contract grievance is not settled in Step 2, it may be referred to Step 3 at the discretion of the initiating party within the time limits described therein or Step 3 may be waived, provided a grievance conference has been held and a grievance decision was rendered in Step 2. If Step 3 is waived, the issue may then be submitted to Step 4 within the time limits described therein.

 12.12 The Union shall be afforded all rights and privileges in filing grievances as an aggrieved employee under this Article.

 12.13 Where the designated Officer as defined in Section 1 above is part of the bargaining unit, a grievance decision by said Officer shall not necessarily be conclusive nor set a precedent. Said decision shall be subject to review and/or reversal by the Chief of the Fire Department at any time. In case a decision is set aside as described above, the ensuing grievance time limits shall become operative when the grievant or Union is notified of the reversal.

 12.14 Employees covered by this Agreement will follow all written and verbal directives, even if such directives are allegedly in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.
