 WHEREAS, the City Council stated in Ordinance 122114 that said appropriation cannot be spent until authorized by future ordinance, and that such an ordinance was not anticipated to be passed until all members of the City Council receive a written plan showing how this money will be spent and how it fits into a long-term plan for revitalization of the Broadway Business District; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of Economic Development convened the Broadway Economic Vitality Action Team comprised of property and business owners, non-profits, developers, and a resident group all with ties to Broadway and/or Capitol Hill and Seattle Central Community College to develop an revitalization plan for 2006-2008; and

 WHEREAS, the Broadway Economic Vitality Action Team has developed the Broadway Economic Vitality Action Agenda (Action Agenda) which proposes complementary strategies for revitalization of the Broadway Business District, as well as Capitol Hill as a whole; and

 WHEREAS, the Broadway Economic Vitality Action Agenda submitted to the Council creates a shared vision and actionable plan to realize the Broadway business district's potential as one of Seattle's great retail corridors and to support a vibrant Capitol Hill business community consistent with Council Resolution 30774; and

 WHEREAS, through the submission of the Action Agenda and subsequent briefings of the Seattle City Council, the Office of Economic Development has satisfied the direction set forth in Subsection 2(b) of Ordinance 122114, and the spending restriction should be lifted; NOW, THEREFORE,
