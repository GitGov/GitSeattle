Consistent with SMC 3.14.911, the Department shall adopt a rule regarding the posting of open housing posters to further the purposes of this Chapter. ~~, which requires owners or other persons to post signs upon property subject to the provisions of this Chapter or at other locations which indicate that such property is available for lease or purchase on a basis which is nondiscriminatory under the provisions of this Chapter.~~ A person violating such rule, after having been issued a written warning from the Department, shall be subject to a penalty of $100 for a first violation, $300 for a second violation and $500  for a third or subsequent ~~penalty for each day of~~ violation.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
