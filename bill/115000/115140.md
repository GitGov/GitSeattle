 Section 2. Administrative jurisdiction over the Designated Portion is hereby transferred, without charge, from the Seattle Department of Transportation to the Department of Parks and Recreation.

 Section 3. The section entitled "ALASKAN WAY" of Appendix I, Description of Park Drives and Boulevards, to Title 15 of the Seattle Municipal Code and to Ordinance 117569, is hereby amended as follows:

 ALASKAN WAY - The westerly 20 feet of Alaskan Way from the northerly margin of University Street to a point approximately 136 feet south of Vacated Virginia Street; and  all of that portion of Alaskan Way from the northerly margin of Broad Street to the northerly margin of Bay Street, except for the railroad franchise rights-of-way granted and described in section 4 of Ordinance 117481.
