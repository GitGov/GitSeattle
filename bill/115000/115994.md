 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the Municipal Court Day Reporting program; increasing an appropriation to the Municipal Court in the 2007 Budget; and creating a new position in the Municipal Court; all by three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Day Reporting program is an alternative-to-incarceration program allowing judges to release defendants that would normally remain in jail per Washington Court Rules, section 3.2; and

 WHEREAS, the Day Reporting program broadens the continuum of alternative-to-incarceration programs available to judges, enabling them to better serve justice equitably and to meet the varied needs of defendants; and

 WHEREAS, the Day Reporting program has reduced costs to the City associated with incarcerating defendants; and

 WHEREAS, the number of defendants participating in the Day Reporting program already exceeds current staffing capacity for the program; and

 WHEREAS, the enhanced supervision provided by the addition of a probation employee will allow judges to consider more defendants for release from jail to the Day Reporting program, potentially further reducing the City''s jail population and associated jail costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Municipal Court does not currently have staffing capacity to assume additional responsibilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and the City Council are fully committed to ensuring that the Municipal Court has the resources it needs to expand the Day Reporting program;
