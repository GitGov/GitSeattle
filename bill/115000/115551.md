 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to day reporting services for misdemeanants; increasing a half-time Probation Counselor position in the Municipal Court's Court Compliance section to full-time; appropriating funds to support the additional position authority; and revising a budget proviso that restricts spending on Jail Services.

 WHEREAS, the 2006 Adopted Budget includes a proviso appropriating $334,450 of the overall Jail Services appropriation solely for a day check-in services center; and

 WHEREAS, the Council's intent in adopting the proviso was to reserve funding for day reporting services as an alternative to incarceration; and

 WHEREAS, the Council anticipated that the City would initially obtain day reporting services from King County, but also that the Municipal Court might develop its own day reporting system; and

 WHEREAS, the City and King County have yet to reach agreement on day reporting services, and the Municipal Court has developed a plan for its own day reporting center; and

 WHEREAS, the first phase of the Municipal Court's plan consists of increasing one half-time position to full-time in order to provide day reporting services to approximately 20 defendants at a time, which would save substantial jail costs; and

 WHEREAS, depending on the results of this first phase and the results of continued negotiations with King County, the Council may or may not choose to implement the subsequent phases of the Municipal Court's plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Municipal Court's first phase plan is consistent with the Council's intent in adopting the Jail Services budget proviso, and the Council therefore intends for the Municipal Court to implement the first phase plan; and
