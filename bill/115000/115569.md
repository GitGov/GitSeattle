 B. On July 7, 2005, the Owner submitted to the City of Seattle an application for a contract rezone from SF 7200 to Lowrise 3 (L3). The purpose of the application is to allow the Property to be used for multi-family residential development.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to 23.34.004, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from SF 7200 to L3:

 1. A ten (10) foot setback is required along all the property lines of the Property shared with the abutting single family zone.

 2. A landscaped buffer is required along all property lines of the Property shared with the abutting single family zone. The buffer shall include at least three trees of a variety and size that will be at least roof-height ten (10) years after planting. Tree species shall be determined and estimated height verified by a landscape professional at the time of permit application.

 3. When the Property is developed, a concrete pedestrian walkway shall be constructed in the right-of-way adjacent to the Property.

 4. The setback, buffer and walkway shall be shown on the plans submitted with a permit application for any future development of the Property.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect two years from the effective date of the approval of this rezone if Owner fails to satisfy the requirement of Section 23.76.060.B.1 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owners and the City; provided, such amendment agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the SF 7200 zone.
