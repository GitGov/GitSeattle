 AN ORDINANCE related to Seattle Public Utilities; amending that department's 2004 budget and its 2004-2009 Adopted Capital Improvement Program by increasing and decreasing certain appropriations, creating new capital projects and programs, and amending the total dollar amounts allocated for certain projects or programs in the 2004 CIP.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 121333, capital projects or programs must be specifically identified in the 2004-2009 Adopted Capital Improvement Program ("CIP") or added to the 2004-2009 Adopted CIP by ordinance before appropriations can be spent on such projects or programs; and

 WHEREAS, for any project or program identified in the 2004-2009 Adopted CIP, Ordinance 121333 requires Council authorization by ordinance of an expenditure that exceeds by more than $1,000,000 the total amount shown in the CIP for 2004 for that project or program; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.08.025 requires Council authorization of certain transfers of appropriations between budget control levels; and

 WHEREAS, certain Seattle Public Utilities projects that are being completed in 2004 were expected to be completed in 2003, and therefore were not identified in Seattle Public Utilities' 2004-2009 Adopted CIP; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities has identified several new projects that it plans to implement in 2004 and wishes to add them to the 2004- 2009 Adopted CIP; and

 WHEREAS, certain Seattle Public Utilities projects will exceed their 2004 CIP allocations by more than $1,000,000 and others are approaching this threshold; and

 WHEREAS, certain Seattle Public Utilities' budget control levels are expected to exceed their 2004 appropriations by more than ten (10) percent by the end of 2004; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities expects to spend less than the 2004 CIP allocations on certain projects and programs and desires to transfer those allocations to the projects created by this ordinance and also to transfer appropriations from the applicable budget control levels to those budget control levels that are expected to exceed their 2004 appropriations by more than ten (10) percent; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Comprehensive Wastewater Plan

 Type: New Facility End Date: 4th Quarter 2005

 Project ID: C304201

 Location: Citywide

 Neighborhood District: In More than One District Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan

 This project develops a long-range plan to guide the development of improvements to the wastewater conveyance system for the next 5 to 20 years, and provides the framework for organizing and prioritizing the wastewater capital improvement program. It provides a decision model for setting priorities and determining the cost-effectiveness of programs and projects from an asset management perspective. The goal is to provide reliable, high quality, cost-effective wastewater services. While no such comprehensive plan has been prepared for wastewater to date, upcoming federal regulations for the Capacity Management, Operation, and Maintenance (CMOM) Program require a similar planning effort. This cost estimate has a medium confidence level.

 Type: New Facility End Date: 1st Quarter 2005

 Project ID: C343205

 Location: Westlake Av N. and Valley St.

 Neighborhood District: Lake Union Neighborhood Plan: South Lake Union

 This project analyzes the feasibility of separating stormwater runoff from the combined sewer system in the South Lake Union Drainage Basin. Separation of stormwater runoff from the combined sewer system increases the available flow-related capacity of the combined sewer system and, in turn, reduces the number of combined sewer system back- ups affecting existing and new developments within the South Lake Union Basin.

 Project ID: C302317

 Location: 4th Ave NW, NW 122nd St, Greenwood Ave and NW 120th St.

 Neighborhood District: Northwest Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan

 This project reduces the stormwater runoff and pollutants from an approximately 70-acre sub-basin of Piper's Creek to protect downstream aquatic resources. The primarily residential project area includes Greenwood Ave. N. and the project will also potentially provide code requirements for a portion of Greenwood Ave. N. to cover future requirements associated with redevelopment of the street right of way. An option will be provided to residents on project streets to invest in sidewalk and landscaping improvements as part of the project through a local improvement district (LID) funding mechanism. Funding to operate and maintain the project is expected to be included in SPU's budget starting in 2009, although surrounding property owners and residents are also expected to provide some level of maintenance. SPU has applied for a $2.3 million loan from the state Department of Ecology to fund a portion of the project. The project cost estimate has a medium confidence level. The project has not yet been approved by SPU's Asset Management Committee.

 Capacity: This project will install stormwater management improvements over approximately 70 acres.

 Project ID: C404603

 Location: SW Michigan and W Marginal Way

 Neighborhood District: Not applicable Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan

 This project replaces the temporary spoils yard on Ellis St. with a permanent yard located at the intersection of SW Michigan and W Marginal Way. It will be designed and built to allow SPU to handle spoils materials from repair sites, sewer and drainage vactor grits, future hydro-excavated materials and store replacement fill materials for completing repair jobs. The facility will be designed to enable the Department to perform these functions environmentally using best management practices. The project may include partners from SDOT, City Light and Seattle Parks. This project is in a preliminary phase of development and cost estimates will be revised over time.

 Capacity: This project will develop a new spoils yard and decant facility.

 Public Place Recycling Containers

 Program: Rehabilitation and Heavy Equipment Start Date: 2nd Quarter 2004

 Type: New Investment End Date: 4th Quarter 2005

 Project ID: C2NW402-009

 Location: Citywide

 This project funds the purchase of recycling containers that will be paired with street side litter containers sited throughout the City, often in Business Improvement Areas, for use by pedestrian traffic. This project, which is part of the City's overall effort to recycle 60% of its waste stream, assumes that 35% of existing street side litter containers will be paired with one recycling container, resulting in approximately 300 total public place recycling containers. The public place recycling containers are purchased over a two-year consecutive period, beginning in 2004. The confidence in the estimate is high and the project has been approved by SPU's Asset Management Committee.

 Project ID: C404501

 Location: Airport Way S

 This project remodels and upgrades SPU's Operations Control Center building. The project includes reconfiguring internal space to improve security and incorporate the new Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The upgraded center accommodates SPU's new Strategic Operations Division, as well as Field Operations administration and electrical, mechanical, maintenance and emergency response crews. This project has not yet been approved by SPU's Asset Management Committee.

 Capacity: This project will expand the capacity of an existing building.

 Project ID: C203005

 Location: 1350 N 34th St. and 8105 5th Ave. S

 This project funds short-term actions to ensure that the City's existing Recycling & Disposal Stations continue to function reliably, pending development and implementation of the Solid Waste Facilities Master Plan (C204002). The work includes emergency electrical service relocation to maintain safe and reliable power, fuel system control reconfiguration, development of a misting system at the South Recycling & Disposal Station, water line and hydrant replacement, and South Household Hazardous Waste entry relocation. The project also includes installation of electric trucking gates, an important security element as SPU does more trucking in off-peak hour periods. Other emergency work is anticipated through 2008. The confidence in the cost estimate is medium. Specific improvements for 2005 have not been approved by SPU's Asset Management Committee.

 Capacity: This project will fund short-term improvements to the existing Solid Waste stations.
