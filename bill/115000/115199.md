 AN ORDINANCE revising allocations in the 2005-2010 Capital Improvement Program for certain Seattle City Light projects.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, through the passage of Ordinance 121660, adopted Seattle City Light's 2005-2005 Capital Improvement Program; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting Seattle City Light's 2005-2010 Capital Improvement Program and as recommended by the Budget Committee in Green Sheet 58-1-A-2, the City Council reduced the Mayor's requested appropriations for City Light's Capital Improvement Program by $16,112,683 in 2005 and $9,752,477 in 2006; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council requested that Seattle City Light submit an ordinance to adjust the allocations in its six-year financing plan in the 2005-2010 Adopted CIP to account for the appropriation adjustments made as recommended in the above-cited Green Sheet; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The annual allocations in the 2005-2010 Capital Improvement Program for Seattle City Light projects shown in Exhibit A are adjusted from the "Adopted" amounts to the respective "Revised" amounts shown in Exhibit A.

 South Lake Union Substation Development

 City Light expects that by ~~~~2010~~~~2011 the development of the South Lake Union district will require a 200 MVA substation in the area. If Interbay Substation is energized by ~~~~2007~~~~2008, the Department anticipates that energizing a new South Lake Union Substation can be deferred until at least ~~~~2010~~~~2011. The factors determining the timing of this substation include actual and anticipated load growth in the South Lake Union Area, and the demand for power from other substations that could possibly serve the area.

 Section 4. The amended dollar amounts in each calendar year established by this legislation serve to reset the base amount for purposes of the $1 million spending adjustment limit in Section 4(c) of Ordinance 121660.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 20__, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 20__.
