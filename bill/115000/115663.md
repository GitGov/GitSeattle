 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to utility submeter testing; amending submeter testing standards; establishing the fee for submeter testing; and amending Section 7.25.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121320, the "Third Party Billing Regulation" adopted in 2003, established a process for City testing of water submeters used in multi-family residential buildings when the tenant contests the submeter's accuracy; and

 WHEREAS, the City regulates water submeters as measuring devices, and pursuant to SMC Section 7.04.140 uses Handbook 44 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish accuracy tolerances for commercial weighing and measuring devices; and

 WHEREAS, the testing standard included in Ordinance 121320 provided for an accuracy tolerance for water submeters of plus or minus 5%, which is inconsistent with the accuracy tolerances provided for in Handbook 44 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The caption of Section 7.25.040 and Subsection 9 of Subsection A of Section 7.25.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code are hereby amended as follows:

 7.25.040 Billing requirements - submeter testing fee.

 A. Notwithstanding the prohibition against submetering electric service in SMC 21.49.100 (G), a landlord may, itself or through a third party billing agent, bill tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility services, including electric service provided to tenants of multi-unit buildings, provided that the following requirements are met:

 9. Submetering. Submetering is permitted as a way of allocating master metered utility services to tenants provided the following conditions are met:

 a. The submeters must be read prior to each billing.

 b. A landlord may not enter a unit without, and a tenant may not unreasonably withhold, consent to enter the unit in order to perform submeter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, and inspection, including removal of the submeter for testing, provided, however, that a landlord may enter a unit without a tenant's consent in the case of a submeter leak or emergency related to that unit's submeter.

 c. (i) The accuracy tolerance for the maximum flow rate shall be within 1.5% for all submeter types. The accuracy tolerance for the minimum flow rate shall be within 3% for Multi-jet submeter types, and within a 1.5% over-registration and a 5% under-registration for other than Multi-jet submeter types.

(ii) If a tenant contests the accuracy of the submeter, the tenant shall have the option of demanding that the City of Seattle provide an independent test of the meter through the ~~Consumer Affairs Division of th~~e Department of Executive Administration. If the meter reads within ~~a 5%~~these ranges of accuracy, the tenant requesting the test shall pay ~~the cost of~~ the meter test fee. If the meter reads outside ~~a 5%~~these ranges of accuracy, the landlord shall pay ~~for the cost of~~ the meter test fee and within 30 days refund any overpayments for the past three months based on a recalculation of the past year's billings by correcting for the inaccuracy of the submeter. Submetering thereafter shall only be permitted with a repaired submeter.

(iii) The meter test fee for each test of a submeter pursuant to this subsection shall be Sixty-five Dollars ($65).

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2006, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2006.
