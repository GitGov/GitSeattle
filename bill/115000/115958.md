 2. INTENTIONALLY DELETED

 3. TERM

 3.1 Term of Amended Lease. Subject to the provisions of this Amended Lease and the terms of the Navy Deed, Lessor leases to Lessee and Lessee leases from Lessor the Premises described below, as a continuation of the Original Lease, which commenced on April 24, 1998. This Amended Lease shall be in effect from the execution date of this Amended Lease ("Effective Date") through December 31, 2049 ("Term"), unless sooner terminated as provided elsewhere in this Amended Lease. The Term of this Amended Lease may be extended by the Director as needed for completion of the development of Phase II as described in Section 10.3 below.

 3.2 Early Termination. The Amended Lease may be terminated earlier, in whole or in part, by written agreement of the Lessor and Lessee; or for default as described in Article 17, after any applicable cure period; or due to casualty as provided in Article 15; or as provided below in this Article or in Articles 5, 6, 8, 18 or 31. If not otherwise specified, termination shall be effective ninety (90) days after written notice of termination from the Lessor. In addition, because Parcel 3 abuts only on Parcel 2 and is to remain unimproved, if this Amended Lease shall be terminated for any reason as to Parcel 2, then Lessor or Lessee each shall have the right, at its option, by written notice to the other, to terminate this Amended Lease as to Parcel 3 effective at any time on or after the effective date of termination as to Parcel 2.

 3.3 Termination if Premises No Longer Used for Homeless. Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Amended Lease by written notice to Lessee if the Premises cease to be used for the homeless.

 4. RENT AND OTHER CHARGES

 4.1 Rent. Lessee shall pay Lessor base rent for the Premises during the Term at the rate of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00) per year. Rent shall be due and payable by Lessee to Lessor on the execution date of the Amended Lease for the first year of the Term and subsequently payable by Lessee on each anniversary of the execution date of the Amended Lease. Lessee reserves the right to prepay the entire Term or portions thereof, but no acceptance of prepayment shall affect the right of the Lessor to terminate this Lease upon the circumstances set forth herein, and there shall be no right to any rebate of prepaid rent upon any such termination.

 4.2 Property Management Costs and Grounds Maintenance Costs.

 (a) Lessee shall pay to Lessor, as additional rent, an amount determined annually by Lessor to cover the share fairly allocable to the Premises of the costs of management of the Sand Point Property ("Management Costs") and the costs of the maintenance of the grounds of the Sand Point Property ("Grounds Maintenance Costs"). Management Costs shall include:

 (i) costs of preparation and administration of the plans and guidelines identified in Article 32 of this Amended Lease;

 (ii) related administrative costs (including the costs of maintaining an administrative office on the Sand Point Property).

 The Lessor shall reasonably allocate Sand Point Property Management Costs and Grounds Maintenance Costs among Lessee and the users of other Sand Point Property, using any reasonable methods of cost allocation; provided, however (1) the total additional rental cost charged to Lessee shall not exceed $100,000.00 per year; (2) the Premises' shares of Sand Point Property Management Costs and Grounds Maintenance Costs shall not exceed 25% of each in any year; and (3) in the event of any reduction in area of the Premises due to partial termination of this Amended Lease, the Lessee's share of Grounds Maintenance Costs shall be based on the reduced area and the 25% maximum for Grounds Maintenance Costs in clause (2) above shall be proportionately reduced. Lessor shall give a written statement to Lessee annually of Lessee's share of Management Costs and Grounds Maintenance Costs for the previous calendar year, and Lessee shall pay such Costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statement. Such payment shall be without prejudice to Lessee's right to make timely objection to the allocation or calculation of such Costs, or a portion thereof, by appeal as provided in Section 4.3 below.

 In order to assist Lessee in budgeting expenditures, no later than November 30th of each year, the Lessor shall develop and provide to Lessee an estimate of Lessee's share of Sand Point Property Management Costs and Grounds Maintenance Costs for the next calendar year and a narrative describing the proposed method of allocation.

 (b) The Lessor shall have the right to discontinue procurement of grounds maintenance services on ninety (90) days written notice to Lessee. If Lessee shall secure express written consent from the Director as part of the MOP of alternative grounds maintenance services to be obtained by Lessee, then Lessee shall have the right, on ninety (90) days written notice, to discontinue participation in the grounds maintenance services procured by Lessor, provided that Lessee shall have entered into, and shall maintain in effect until otherwise approved by the Director in writing, a contract for such alternative grounds maintenance services as shall have been consented to by the Director, which contract shall be reasonably acceptable to the Director and shall not be subject to cancellation without ninety (90) days written notice to the Director. At least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of any such contract, Lessee shall renew such contract or procure a substitute contract acceptable to the Director and shall provide evidence of renewal, or a copy of the signed substitute contract, to the Director. For so long as grounds maintenance services procured by Lessor are discontinued, Lessee shall not be liable to Lessor for Grounds Maintenance Costs hereunder. Lessor shall have the right to reinstate procurement of grounds maintenance services, to be charged to Lessee hereunder, as follows: (i) upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lessee if Lessor shall have elected to discontinue procurement of grounds maintenance services under this Section and Lessee shall not have contracted for substitute services, or (ii) upon fifteen (15) days' notice to Lessee if Lessee shall have contracted for such services, Lessor shall have determined that such services are not sufficient or are not being performed in an acceptable manner, and Lessee shall have failed to remedy such situation within fifteen (15) days after a previous notice to Lessee; or (iii) at any time without prior notice if Lessee shall have elected to discontinue Lessor-provided grounds maintenance services and thereafter Lessee shall have failed to renew its contract for grounds maintenance services (or provide a substitute contract acceptable to Lessor) at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of such contract, or the services contracted for by Lessee shall have been suspended or terminated for any reason.

 4.3 Lessee's Right to Contest Costs; Mediation.

 (a) If Lessee gives written notice to Lessor, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the statement under Section 4.2, that it contests the method of allocation or the computation of Management Costs or Grounds Maintenance Costs, setting forth the specific item or items to which it objects, the dollar amount that Lessee believes should be payable, and the general grounds for such objection (a "Contest Notice") then within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Contest Notice Lessor shall give written notice to Lessee of whether Lessor will revise the allocation or computation. If Lessor elects to perform such a revision, then within fifteen (15) days thereafter Lessor shall deliver to Lessee its revised computation and Lessee shall have the same right, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the revised computation, to send another Contest Notice with respect to the revised computation, in which case the same procedure shall apply.

 (b) If the Lessor gives notice that it does not intend to revise its computation, or does not respond to Lessee's Contest Notice within fifteen (15) days after the receipt thereof, then Lessee may, within ten (10) days after such notice from Lessor or the expiration of such period, as the case may be, request a conference with Lessor to discuss the points of dispute. Lessor shall schedule such conference, involving Lessor and Lessee representatives with authority to resolve the dispute, within ten (10) days of receipt of such request, with at least five (5) days advance notice to Lessee of the time and place. If the dispute is not resolved at such conference or if Lessee does not request such a conference, then Lessee shall prepare and submit to Lessor, within thirty (30) days after the date when Lessee became entitled to request such conference, the Lessee's detailed computation of the items in dispute showing the amount that Lessee believes should have been payable by Lessee for each disputed item and the method of allocation used. Lessor shall make available to Lessee, to assist in such preparation, all relevant documents in Lessor's possession (subject to any applicable privileges). If requested by Lessor, the Lessee shall meet with Lessor to explain Lessee's detailed calculation.

 (c) If the procedure required by the preceding paragraph does not result in resolution of the appeal, then not fewer than ten (10) days after the submission of Lessee's detailed calculation, either party may initiate by written notice to the other party a non- binding, structured mediation with the assistance of an individual or organization experienced in alternative dispute resolution ("ADR"). Such written notice must propose one or more independent mediators or organizations with such experience. The Lessor and the Lessee shall use best efforts to agree on a single qualified mediator. If the parties do not agree on a mediator within ten (10) days after the date of delivery of the notice electing mediation, then either party may request that a mediator be appointed by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services in Seattle, WA or in the absence of such private service, then a similar dispute resolution organization appointed by the presiding judge of King County Superior Court and the designation of such organization shall be binding. The ADR process will be initiated within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice electing mediation unless extended by an agreement of both parties. The ADR procedures utilized for the mediation shall include the exchange of written claims and responses, with supporting information, at least ten (10) days prior to the actual mediation. Each party waives, for purpose of any subsequent arbitration or legal proceeding, any evidentiary privilege with respect to communications made between the parties during the mediation. The findings and recommendations of the mediator shall be admissible in any subsequent arbitration or legal proceeding. If the mediation, or any subsequent judgment, arbitration award or agreement, results in payment by the Lessee of an amount less than one-half the dollar amount then in dispute, defined as the difference in dollar amount between the Lessor's and Lessee's written positions as submitted to the mediator, then all fees and costs of the mediator shall be paid by Lessor; otherwise all such fees and costs shall be paid by Lessee. Any costs or fees of attorneys or experts incurred for purposes of mediation may be awarded in favor of the substantially prevailing party in any subsequent arbitration or court proceeding, to the extent such costs reasonably would have been incurred for purposes of trial or hearing in the absence of mediation.

 (d) If Lessee fails to comply with any of the deadlines set forth in subsections (a) or (b) of this Section then the allocation and computation as most recently provided to Lessee by Lessor shall become final and binding. If neither party elects mediation within the period set forth in subsection (c), or if for any reason no mediator is agreed upon or appointed within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice of election of mediation, or if mediation fails to result in agreement within sixty (60) days of the date of such notice, then either party may initiate legal proceedings to resolve the issues in dispute.

 (e) Lessee shall, as a condition of its right to contest any allocation or computation, pay to the Lessor, together with any Contest Notice or any subsequent calculation by Lessee of the amounts payable with respect to the items in dispute, the entire amount of Grounds Maintenance Costs and Management Costs that would be payable if the Lessee's position were accepted (to the extent such amounts shall not have been paid previously). If it shall later be determined or agreed that all or a portion of the amount in dispute was properly payable, or if any such amount becomes properly payable then Lessee shall promptly pay such amount, together with interest (if any) at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from and after the earlier of ten (10) days after the date of such determination or agreement; ten (10) days after Lessee's failure to comply with a deadline in this Section; or forty-five (45) days after the date when such amount was payable under the terms of this Amended Lease.

 (f) If at any time during the Term, Lessee believes that the Lessor's property management services or grounds maintenance services provided for the Premises are inadequate or incomplete, Lessee may identify such problems in writing to the Lessor and to the Magnuson Park Community Communications Committee described in Section 32.1 within a reasonable period of time after Lessee is, or should reasonably be, aware of such problems. Such letter shall reference this subsection of this Amended Lease. The Lessor shall promptly review the problems identified in the letter and, if so requested by Lessee, convene a meeting within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the letter between appropriate representatives of the Lessor and Lessee to review the issues and potential solutions. Within forty-five (45) days following receipt of the letter, the Lessor shall issue a written response fully addressing the problems identified by Lessee and discussed at the meeting. If Lessee believes the response is incomplete or inadequate or that solutions proposed by the Lessor will result in unfair allocation of Management Costs or Grounds Maintenance Costs, Lessee will promptly notify the Lessor in writing of that position. Failure of Lessee to provide reasonable notice of problems as required in this subsection shall constitute a waiver by Lessee of its rights under this Amended Lease to contest the fairness of the Lessor's allocation or computation of Management Costs or Grounds Maintenance Costs directly related to such problems.

 5. PREMISES; USE

 5.1 Use of Premises.

 (a) Lessee agrees that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Premises shall be solely devoted to the development and operation of a residential living complex for homeless persons and families (including community space, computer lab, landscaping, gardens, playgrounds and other open space available to such residents), and for related services to the homeless and persons at risk of being homeless as may be approved by the Lessor and as may be consistent with applicable federal or state laws and regulations. On an interim basis, and with the express written consent of the Director, Lessee may conduct or permit other uses on portions of the Premises on which development of facilities for the homeless is not yet ready to begin, provided that such uses are consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, plans, guidelines and policies, that Lessee complies with any conditions stated by the Director in granting any such consent, and that such uses do not conflict with or delay the development and use of the Premises for the homeless. Any net revenue to Lessee from any such interim uses shall be used for costs of developing the Premises for use by the homeless or for services to the homeless.

 (b) All nonresidential space in the buildings on the Premises shall be used solely for services to the homeless (including formerly homeless persons residing on the Premises) unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Lessor. Lessee shall maintain and produce for inspection and copying upon demand by the Lessor or HUD records demonstrating compliance with this Section.

 (c) At all times during the Amended Lease, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Lessor, all usable space in the Improvements on the Premises shall be used for purposes that qualify as the necessary support of the poor or infirm, as authorized under Article VIII, Section 7 of the Washington State Constitution.

 5.2 Inability to Continue Use for Homeless. If Lessee is unable to continue operation of any part of the Premises consistent with this Amended Lease and the MOP, other than a portion that is then subject to a Sublease, due to unavailability of sufficient operating funds, then Lessee shall so inform Lessor in writing and Lessee shall have no liability in damages to Lessor for failure to continue such use. Upon such notification, Lessor shall then have the right to terminate this Amended Lease, by thirty (30) days' written notice to Lessee, as to the Parcel or Parcels of the Premises as to which such notice is given.

 5.3 Title to Improvements and Personal Property. Lessee represents and warrants that SPCHA has conveyed to the Lessee all right title and interest to all Buildings on the Premises, except the right, title and interest of Sublessees and Tenants. In addition, the Lessee represents and warrants that SPCHA has transferred to Lessee all of its right, title and interest in and to all personal property on the Premises that was owned by SPCHA at the time of the execution of the Assumption Agreement. Lessee, or if so permitted in writing by the Lessor, a Sublessee, shall hold title to all New Buildings constructed on the Premises, and in the event of termination of a Sublease to a Sublessee that holds title to any Improvements, such title shall vest in Lessee to the full extent permitted by law and the terms of any liens thereon (including any liens in favor of the Lessor). Lessee's title to all Improvements and personal property shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Amended Lease, including without limitation the reversion to the Lessor upon termination. Lessee's title to the Buildings and Personal Property shall be subject to any reservations, conditions, and restrictions contained in the conveyance of such property from the United States to the Lessor. Lessee shall have no right to remove, destroy, damage or alter any Improvement or portion thereof, nor to permit any Sublessee to do any of the foregoing, without the express written consent of the Director.

 6. OWNERSHIP OF IMPROVEMENTS AND PERMISSION OF LESSOR

 [6.1-6.4 Reserved]

 6.5 Ownership of Improvements. The parties acknowledge that at the inception of the Original Lease the Lessor conveyed title to the Improvements then on the Premises to SPCHA by quitclaim deed with reversion, and the SPCHA subsequently conveyed title to certain Buildings to Sublessees, with the consent of the Lessor. Lessee has received and recorded a quitclaim deed to the Improvements from SPCHA, with the consent of the Lessor. The parties intend that, because the Original Lease has not terminated, but rather has been assigned and amended with the agreement of Lessor, there is no reversion of title under the deed from the Lessor to SPCHA. Subject to the terms of this Amended Lease, and to the interests of any Sublessees and their successors and assigns, Lessee shall retain ownership of the Improvements until the expiration of the Amended Lease, or the termination of the Amended Lease either in whole or with respect to the portion of the Premises where specific Improvements are located. Lessee acknowledges that Lessor makes no warranty or representation whatever as to title or ownership of any interests in the Improvements as of the Effective Date of this Amended Lease. At the expiration of the Term, or if this Amended Lease is earlier terminated as provided under this Amended Lease, the Improvements (or those Improvements located on the portion of the Premises as to which the Amended Lease is terminated, in case of a partial termination), together with all related Personal Property, shall become the property of Lessor without any payment by Lessor; provided, that the Lessor may require the Lessee to remove, within ten (10) days after notice to Lessee, at Lessee's sole expense, any fixtures or structures on or under the Premises that were constructed, affixed or substantially modified without the approval of the Lessor or in violation of applicable laws, regulations or Codes, or that were permitted by Lessor on condition that they be removed upon expiration or termination of the Amended Lease.

 6.6 Permission of Lessor. Subject to any restrictions on the Property reserved in the conveyance by the United States, the Director shall not unreasonably withhold permission for Lessee and its contractors and subcontractors to engage in any excavation or construction activities reasonably necessary to construct, repair, alter or improve the Buildings consistent with Construction Plans acceptable to the Director. Lessor agrees to timely review and respond to requests for approvals or permissions for related excavation and construction as may be necessary under this Amended Lease or as may be necessary to secure building or other permits as may be required by applicable law. Lessor further agrees to cooperate with and permit the hook-up of any and all necessary utilities to the Buildings. However, Lessee shall obtain any and all necessary permits for utility hook-ups as required by applicable law.

 7. MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION

 7.1 Management and Operating Plan. The operation and management of the Premises by Lessee shall be conducted consistent with the Management and Operating Plan ("MOP") with annual updates approved by the Lessor as described in Article 36, and consistent with the plans and guidelines referred to in Article 32, subject to the express provisions of this Amended Lease and to requirements of applicable laws, regulations and ordinances.

 7.2 Property Manager. Lessee may contract with one or more property managers to manage the operation of the Premises consistent with this Amended Lease and the MOP, but no delegation of any duty or obligation to any property manager shall limit the responsibility or liability of Lessee hereunder.

 7.3 Buildings Operated by Lessee; Operation Funding. Buildings 330, 331, 332, 224, and Buildings 26N and 26S initially shall be operated by Sublessees, subject to the provisions of Article 18 below.

 7.4 Rules and Regulations. The Lessee agrees to observe, and to take all reasonable measures to cause Sublessees, Tenants and other persons allowed on the Premises to observe, such reasonable rules and regulations governing the Premises as the Lessor as landlord may promulgate from time to time.

 8. DELAY IN PERFORMANCE

 8.1 Force Majeure. Subject to Section 8.2, Lessee shall not be considered in breach of its obligations under this Amended Lease, including but not limited to the development of plans and specifications, securing of funding commitments or commencement and completion of construction of the Improvements, in the event of delays in the performance of its obligations due to causes beyond Lessee's reasonable control and without its negligence, including but not restricted to, any delays or suspensions of construction compelled by court order, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, reasonably unforeseeable acts of a unit of local, state or federal government, reasonably unforeseeable acts or omissions by other parties, fires, floods, strikes, embargoes, delays in essential utility services and unusually severe weather or delays of contractors or subcontractors due to such causes. The time for the performance of the obligation shall be extended for the period of the enforced delay if Lessee shall request promptly an extension of time in writing from Lessor but, in any event within thirty (30) days after Lessee becomes aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the cause of any such delay. Failure of the Lessee or its Sublessee to obtain sufficient funding for the construction of new Improvements, after exercising its best efforts, shall be considered a cause beyond Lessee's reasonable control under this Section, provided that Lessee shall be continuing diligent efforts to obtain such funding.

 8.2 Lessor's Right of Termination Notwithstanding Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any force majeure under Section 8.1 or any other provision of this Amended Lease, the parties recognize that the capital funding, operational funding and other aspects of the Phase II development are subject to uncertainties beyond the control of Lessee. The parties recognize, however, that extended delays in carrying out development of Phase II, whether or not due to fault of Lessee, could frustrate the purpose of this Amended Lease. Therefore, if for any reason, whether or not within the control of Lessee, the Lessee shall not have completed the construction of one or more New Buildings on each of Parcels 1, 5 and 9 substantially in compliance with this Amended Lease within six (6) years following the Effective Date of this Amended Lease, then the Lessor, without any recourse by Lessee under the terms of this Amended Lease, shall have the absolute right, upon ninety (90) days' notice to Lessee, to terminate this Amended Lease as to each such Parcel on which no New Building shall then have been so completed, but the Amended Lease shall remain in effect as to any of such Parcels on which one or more New Buildings shall then have been so completed.

 9. TAXES AND UTILITY CHARGES

 9.1 Taxes. The Lessee shall pay, before delinquency, all taxes, levies, and assessments arising from its activities on or occupancy of the Premises, including, but not limited to taxes arising out of the activity or business conducted on the Premises such as the rental or sale of goods or services; taxes levied on its property, equipment, and improvements on the Premises; and taxes on the Lessee's interest under this Amended Lease and any leasehold interest deemed to have been created thereby under Ch. 82.29A RCW. In the event the State of Washington makes any demand upon the City as Lessor for payment of leasehold excise taxes resulting from the Lessee's occupation of the Premises or withholds funds due to the Lessor to enforce collection of leasehold excise taxes, the Lessee shall, at its sole expense, contest such action and indemnify the Lessor for all sums expended by, or withheld by the State from, the Lessor in connection with such taxation.

 9.2 Utility Charges. The Lessee, at the Lessee's sole expense, shall pay for, when due, all costs for providing all utilities and other services on or to the Premises, including but not limited to, elevator service, electricity, gas, water, telephone, sewer, garbage, heating and janitorial, and shall also pay all charges for utility installation and modifications thereto within or in the immediate area of any of the existing or new buildings on the Premises, including new connections to water or sewer mains required in connection with the construction, rehabilitation, modification or use thereof as contemplated hereby. The Lessor shall be responsible for the installation or improvement of water or sewer mains, drainage facilities and electricity lines to the Premises if required for the purposes of the uses contemplated by this Amended Lease, but shall not be responsible for connections, meters and related installations that would be the responsibility of the owner or developer of a building on private property according to standard policies of Lessor for utilities. Lessor's installations and improvements shall be made, to the extent required, in time to serve new Improvements constructed on the Premises in accordance with this Amended Lease. Lessee acknowledges that the cost of such utility improvements may be paid wholly or in part from funds previously appropriated for housing at the Sand Point Property. The Lessor shall not be liable for any injury, loss or damage caused by or resulting from any interruption or failure of utility services due to any causes whatsoever except the Lessor's gross negligence or breach of this Amended Lease. The Lessee shall not be entitled to an offset, reduction, or return of Rent as a result of any interruption or failure of said services.

 9.3 No Charges for Service to Other Property. Nothing contained herein shall require Lessee to pay any gas, electrical, water, sewer or any other charge for utility service furnished to the Sand Point Property retained by Lessor and not conveyed to Lessee under the terms of this Amended Lease.

 9.4 Lessee's Right to Contest. Lessee shall have the right to contest or review by legal proceedings or in such other manner as may be legal, any tax, assessment, utility charge or other governmental imposition mentioned above and to pay such items under protest; provided, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to restrain the exercise of any remedy by any City utility for nonpayment, and provided further that notwithstanding any protest or challenge Lessee shall timely pay such amounts as are necessary to avoid interruption in service, including any interruption that would occur from application of the normal policy or procedure of any City utility.

 10. ALTERATIONS; CONDITION AND CARE OF PREMISES

 10.1 General Condition. The Lessee shall at all times keep the Premises in a neat, clean, safe and sanitary condition, and shall use and maintain the Premises in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and Charter, ordinances and Codes of The City of Seattle, and in accordance with all valid rules and regulations of the Health Officer, Fire Marshal, Director of DPD and other appropriate officers of The City of Seattle. The Lessee shall comply with the previous sentence at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The Lessee shall not cause or permit any waste, damage, or injury to the Premises; use or permit on said Premises anything that will increase the rate of fire insurance thereon; maintain anything on the Premises that may be dangerous to life or limb; overload the floors; permit any objectionable noise or odor to escape or to be emitted from said Premises; or permit anything to be done upon said Premises that in any way will tend to create a nuisance.

 10.2 Lessee Accepts Premises AS IS; Maintenance-Repairs:

 (a) Lessee has fully inspected the Premises. Lessee is fully familiar with the condition of the Premises. Lessee accepts the Premises AS IS, in their condition on the Effective Date, and ASSUMES THE RISK of any defects in the condition of the Premises and of all the matters set forth below. Lessor makes NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND. Lessee agrees that any express or implied representations or warranties made by or on behalf of the Lessor prior to the date hereof, unless expressly set forth in this Amended Lease, are hereby revoked and canceled and shall have no force or effect. Lessee further agrees that no representations or warranties are implied by any provision of this Amended Lease or any other words or conduct in connection with this transaction.

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, Lessee agrees that, except as may be specifically set forth in this Amended Lease, neither Lessor nor any person for whom Lessor may have any responsibility makes any representation, warranty or promise of any kind with regard to any of the following: (1) the physical condition of the Premises or improvements (land, buildings, fixtures, or infrastructure), whether or not readily determined by inspection; (2) the presence or absence of any underground tanks or any hazardous or defective substances or conditions on or about the Property, or on adjacent properties; (3) the history of the Property or activities that may have occurred or been conducted thereon or thereunder; (4) soils conditions or drainage; (5) square footage of land or buildings; (6) encroachments; or (7) location or condition of utility lines.

 (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Amended Lease, Lessee hereby irrevocably releases and waives any and all claims that Lessee has or may have hereafter against Lessor with respect to the condition of the Property or arising pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or the Washington State Model Toxics Control Act, as amended.

 (d) Lessee agrees that the Lessor shall have no liability or obligation as a result of any defect or condition of the Premises, including without limitation latent defects. The Lessor shall have no obligation for any repairs, maintenance, or work of any kind except as expressly set forth in this Amended Lease.

 (e) Lessee acknowledges that the improvements on the Premises may not be fit for occupancy for the purposes intended, or in some cases for any purpose, without substantial rehabilitation and modifications. Lessee further acknowledges that the buildings on the Premises may not be in compliance with applicable Codes and may not satisfy standards of various potential funding sources for operation of the buildings. Lessee agrees that Lessor has no obligation to cause any such buildings to comply with any such Codes or standards, and that if Lessee fails to bring such buildings into compliance Lessee and its Sublessees will not be permitted to use or occupy the buildings for the purposes intended.

 (f) Lessee and Lessor acknowledge that this Section has been specifically bargained for and that Lessor would not be willing to lease the Premises on the terms and conditions set forth herein without Lessee's agreement to the terms of this Section.

 10.3 Phase II: New Construction. The parties agree that "Phase II" of the development of the Premises shall consist of the demolition of building 310 and the new construction of additional residential structures as New Buildings for the homeless. Lessee shall develop a general housing and services plan for Phase II development, which shall be prepared according to a format approved by the Director and in cooperation with the Lessor, the neighboring community, and the Committees. No later than December 31, 2007, the Lessee shall submit a general housing and services plan for Phase II development acceptable to the Director and consistent with the Application. The plan may include several distinct sequential steps such as a Phase IIA and Phase IIB, for example. The plan shall include, without limitation, a schedule for development, cost estimates, intended fund sources, and an open space element. Upon approval of the plan for Phase II by the Lessor (which may involve action by the City Council after acceptance by the Director), with such modifications or additions as the Lessor may reasonably require, the Lessee shall pursue diligent efforts to implement the Plan in accordance with the schedule contained therein. Such efforts shall include, without limitation, timely submission of complete applications for funding to all appropriate funding sources and submission of all applications required under all Codes. In the planning, design and construction of New Buildings and related Improvements the Lessee shall comply fully with all of the following plans approved or to be approved by the Lessor, as the same may be amended by Lessor: Physical Development Management Plan and Historic Property Reuse and Protection Plan.

 10.4 Alterations.

 (a) The Lessee shall not make, or cause to be made, any alteration, addition or improvement in the Premises, including without limitation installation, removal or modification of fencing or landscaping, without first obtaining the written consent of the Director for such work. The Director's approval of alterations, additions or improvements expressly contemplated by this Amended Lease shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that the Lessee demonstrates the availability of sufficient financial resources to complete such alterations, additions or improvements and provided that the Construction Plans conform to the plans and guidelines referred to in Section 10.3. Ordinary repairs and any non-structural alteration of any structure that, together with all other items of the same nature during the calendar year, cost less than $15,000.00, and emergency repairs immediately necessary for the usual and customary usage of the Premises, in each case if at the sole expense of Lessee, shall not require such prior written consent. All alterations, additions and improvements made shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, and unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Director, shall remain in and be surrendered with the Premises as a part thereof at the expiration or termination of this Amended Lease, without disturbance, molestation or injury.

 (b) The Lessor reserves an unqualified right to make repairs or alterations to the Premises or to the buildings thereon (i) where conditions deemed by the Director to constitute an emergency exist, or (ii) after prior written notice to Lessee requesting Lessee to make such repair or alteration in order to correct deficiencies in compliance with any applicable law, regulation or Code. Lessee shall reimburse Lessor on demand for the cost of any such repairs or alterations if made after the Lessee shall have failed or refused to do so. The Lessor also reserves the right to make general alterations to the Premises or to any buildings thereon at no cost to Lessee where such general alterations will not unreasonably interfere with the ordinary operation of the Premises or such building by the Lessee or its permitted Sublessees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lessor reserves the right to demolish Building 310, and shall be under no obligation to replace such building.

 (c) In the event that, after a Building or other Improvement on the Premises has been placed in service as contemplated by the Application after the commencement of the Original Lease, such Building shall, in the Lessor's reasonable judgment, immediately require an extraordinary capital improvement (such as replacement of a major building system), and sufficient funds are not available in the Lessee's capital reserves for such purpose, then the Lessor may make such capital improvement, and may require that the Lessee contribute all available funds in Lessee's capital reserves toward the cost of such capital improvement, subject to any approval required by any funding agreement approved in writing by the Lessor.

 10.5 Access. The Lessor reserves for itself, its officers, employees, agents and contractors, free access to said Premises, including the buildings thereon, at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting, cleaning, or making repairs, additions or alterations to the Premises or any other property owned by or under the control of the Lessor, but this right shall not be construed as an agreement on the part of the Lessor to make said inspections, or to clean or make repairs, additions or alterations.

 10.6 Signs. Lessee shall not display, inscribe, paint or affix to any part of the Premises any sign except those indicating the name of Lessee or its Sublessee and the names and nature of the programs, services and facilities provided by Lessee and Sublessees on the Premises, without approval in writing by the Director prior to such placement.

 10.7 Keys. Any change in locks shall be at the sole expense of the Lessee. If a lock change is made to the exterior door of any Building, Lessee shall provide the Director with one (1) key for each lock changed immediately after such change has been completed.

 10.8 Equipment; Personal Property. All equipment and all appliances such as dishwashers, stoves, refrigerators, washers, and dryers located on the Premises shall be maintained and repaired by the Lessee at no cost to the Lessor.

 10.9 Contracting for Alterations, Maintenance, Repairs, and Construction. Lessee shall ensure that all contracts and subcontracts for any alterations, maintenance, repairs, and construction activities (including contracts for related professional services) shall be made, entered into, and performed in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, fund source requirements, and the terms of this Amended Lease (collectively, "requirements"), whether such contracts are let or made by the Lessee or by a Sublessee or other person. Lessee shall ensure, under all such contracts and subcontracts, that work shall be performed by licensed and qualified contractors, and that wages and benefits shall be paid in compliance with all applicable requirements. Lessee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Lessor and its officers and employees from any claim, demand, liability, or cost (including attorneys fees) resulting from any failure by Lessee to ensure compliance as set forth in this Section.

 10.10 Hazardous Waste or Materials.

 (a) Restriction on Use; Response Plan; Definition. Lessee shall not dispose of or otherwise allow the release of any hazardous substances in, on or under the Premises, or any adjacent property, or in any Improvements placed on the Premises. Lessee represents, warrants and agrees that Lessee's uses of the Premises (including uses by Tenants, invitees or licensees) shall not involve the use, production, disposal or bringing onto the premises of any hazardous substances, except for cleaning and maintenance supplies normally used in the operation of similar buildings that shall be used, stored and disposed of in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and prudent practices. Lessee understands and agrees that flammable or hazardous substances are not allowed on the Premises without the express written permission of the Lessor. In the event such written permission is granted by the Lessor, then Lessee shall handle and dispose of such hazardous materials in accordance with all applicable laws. Prior to bringing any hazardous substance onto the Premises, Lessee shall prepare and submit to the Lessor a hazardous materials response plan, acceptable to the Lessor. Lessee shall comply fully with such plan, at Lessee's sole expense. As used herein, the term "hazardous substances" includes asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum products, lead, explosives, paint, resins, solvents and any substance, waste or material defined or designated as hazardous, toxic or dangerous (or any similar term) by any federal, state or local statute, regulation, rule or ordinance now or hereafter in effect, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. section 9601 et seq., and the Model Toxics Control Act, RCW 70.105D.

 (b) Receipt of Information; Treatment of Existing Hazardous Substances. Lessee acknowledges that it has received a copy of the report of the "Lead Inspection Data, NAVSTA Puget Sound, Seattle, Washington" prepared by Environmental Engineering Branch, Code 414, Navy Public Works Center, Norfolk, Virginia (undated), the Department of the Navy's Finding of Suitability to Lease dated July 1, 1996; the Washington Department of Ecology's "No Further Action" Letter dated May 16, 1996 (including Appendix I thereto); the Department of the Navy's Draft Environmental Impact Statement dated November 1996 and the lead-based paint disclosure document attached as Exhibit F, and that all documents referred to in the foregoing, plus the materials compiled by the Department of the Navy regarding asbestos-containing material ("ACM") on the Premises, have been made available to the Lessee. Prior to the removal of ACM and lead-based paint, Lessee shall use due care not to disturb or cause the deterioration or release of any such ACM or lead-based paint and shall, in connection with any work done on the buildings containing the lead-based paint and ACM, cause all lead-based paint hazards to be abated, and shall cause ACM to be removed and disposed of, or professionally encapsulated if such alternative is in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and prudent practices. Lessee shall cause all abatement and encapsulation work to be performed, and all disposal activities to be performed, in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, including without limitation the "Guidelines for Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint in Housing" issued by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), as in effect at the time such work is performed, and Lessee shall maintain adequate documentation to demonstrate such compliance.

 (c) Compliance. Lessee shall promptly comply at Lessee's expense with all statutes, regulations and ordinances, and with all orders, decrees or judgments of governmental authorities or courts having jurisdiction, relating to the use, collection, treatment, disposal, storage, control, removal or cleanup of hazardous substances either

 (i) in, on, around or under the Buildings, regardless of the source of the hazardous substances, or

 (ii) in, on or under any other part of the Premises or any adjacent property if resulting from a release caused by the act or omission of Lessee, any Sublessee, or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors, Tenants, licensees or invitees.

 (d) Rights of Lessor. After notice to Lessee and a reasonable opportunity for Lessee to effect such compliance, Lessor may, but is not obligated to, enter upon the Premises and take such actions and incur such costs and expenses to comply with any applicable laws, regulations or guidelines regarding hazardous substances as the Lessor deems advisable to protect its interest in the Premises, provided, however, that Lessor shall not be obligated to give Lessee notice and an opportunity to effect such compliance if such delay may reasonably result in material harm to the City, the tenants, providers, the public or the United States and, (i) Lessee has already had actual knowledge of the situation and a reasonable opportunity to effect such compliance, or (ii) Lessor deems that an emergency exists. Whether or not Lessee has actual knowledge of the release of hazardous substances, Lessee shall reimburse Lessor on demand for the full amount of all costs and expenses incurred by Lessor in connection with compliance activities with respect to hazardous substances for which Lessee has responsibility under subsection 10.10(b) or (c) of this Amended Lease, and such obligation shall continue even after the termination of this Amended Lease.

 (e) Lessee's Duty to Notify and Cooperate; Response to Release. Lessee agrees to cooperate in any environmental assessments conducted by the Lessor's staff or independent third parties. Lessee agrees to provide the Lessor with notice of every governmental inspection of the leased Premises, notice of violation, and order to clean up contamination, within five (5) days after the receipt thereof by Lessee. Lessee agrees to permit the Lessor to participate in all settlement or abatement discussions. In addition, Lessee shall notify Lessor immediately of the presence or release of any hazardous substances as described in subsection (c) of this Section (other than hazardous substances permitted under subsection (a) that are stored, used, handled and disposed or in compliance herewith) and shall take timely and appropriate steps to protect persons and property from, and remedy the effects of, any such hazardous substances, which steps shall include immediate action in the case of any material release of hazardous substances.

 (f) Removal Upon Surrender. Upon surrender of the Premises or any Parcel(s) thereof to the Lessor, whether upon expiration or earlier termination of this Amended Lease (in whole or in part), Lessee shall remove and properly dispose of any hazardous substances that were introduced into, or released on, in or under, the Premises or such Parcel(s), as the case may be, at any time during the Term hereof, whether by Lessee, any Sublessee, or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors, Tenants, licensees or invitees, or any other person except for the Lessor or its employees, agents or contractors.

 (g) Indemnity. Lessee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Lessor against any and all losses, liabilities, suits, obligations, fines, damages, judgments, penalties, claims, charges, clean-up costs, remedial actions, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, consultants' fees, attorneys' fees and disbursements) that may be imposed on, incurred or paid by, or asserted against Lessor or the Premises by reason of, or in connection with (i) any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or other default by Lessee under this Amended Lease; (ii) the acts or omissions of Lessee, any Sublessee or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors, Tenants, licensees or invitees, resulting in the release of any hazardous substances; (iii) any actual or alleged injury, illness, death or damage to any person resulting from the presence or release of any hazardous substance in, on, or under the Premises, whether or not present at the inception of this Amended Lease; or (iv) any off-site disposal, handling, treatment, storage, or transportation of any hazardous substances, including petroleum products, removed from the Buildings or Premises by Lessee or its Sublessees, or their respective Tenants, invitees, contractors or subcontractors. This indemnity provision shall survive termination or expiration of this Amended Lease.

 (h) No Waiver of Federal Obligations; Notices and Enforcement by Lessee. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to relieve the United States government or any department thereof from any liability or responsibility with respect to hazardous substances. In the event that Lessee becomes aware of any hazardous substance condition, or any complaint, notice or claim related to any hazardous substance(s), with respect to which the United States or a department thereof may have any obligation pursuant to the terms of the Navy Deed or pursuant to applicable law, the Lessee shall give written notice of the pertinent facts, together with a copy of any written complaint, notice or claim, to the Director and to the United States Department of the Navy as soon as practicable and in any event not later than ninety (90) days after learning of any such condition or fifteen (15) days after receipt of any such complaint, notice or claim, whichever is earlier. Lessee shall provide the United States Navy, and any other agency responsible for investigation, remediation, or defense of the matter, all additional documents and cooperation requested or required by the terms of the Navy Deed or by law. To the full extent permitted by the terms of the Navy Deed and applicable law, the Lessee shall have the right, after consultation with Lessor, to make demand on the United States to fulfill its obligations with respect to any hazardous substances discovered in, on or under the Premises and to enforce such obligations in its own name, provided that (i) Lessee shall not waive or release any rights without the express written consent of the Director; (ii) Lessee shall send copies of all related correspondence to the Director immediately upon sending or receipt thereof by Lessee; (iii) Lessee shall not request or authorize any excavation, demolition or other response action without the written consent of the Director if such action could reasonably adversely affect any Improvements on the Premises or any utilities on, in, or under the Premises, or if such action could reasonably interfere materially with the use of any portion of the Premises for the purposes intended by this Amended Lease.

 (i) Mutual Obligations to Cooperate Regarding Federal Environmental Obligations. If any circumstances arise that would provide reasonable grounds for the enforcement of any obligations (including without limitation indemnities) of the United States regarding environmental matters in the Navy Deed, or any obligations of the United States with respect to the Premises under applicable laws regarding environmental matters (either generally or with respect to base closures), and if Lessee or Lessor gives notice to the other of such circumstances and requests cooperation in pursuing such enforcement, then the other party shall cooperate in securing the benefits of such obligations. Nothing in this subsection (i) shall require either party (A) to expend funds except as authorized by its governing body, in its discretion, nor (B) to bring or join in any legal or administrative action if such party determines in good faith that such action would not be in the best interests of such party.

 11. MAINTENANCE

 11.1 Protection and Maintenance Obligations of Lessee.

 (a) Lessee shall at all times keep the Buildings and other Improvements in a neat, clean, safe and sanitary condition; shall not cause or permit waste, damage or injury; and shall use and maintain the Buildings and other Improvements in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and Charter, ordinances and Codes of The City of Seattle, and in accordance with all valid rules and regulations of the Health Officer, Fire Marshal, Director of Planning and Development ("DPD") and other appropriate officers of The City of Seattle. Lessee shall maintain building 310, prior to its demolition, according to the standards for vacant buildings in City Codes and DPD rules.

 (b) Lessee shall comply with this Section at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

Such maintenance shall be to the same standard, and generally with the same frequency, as maintenance of other grounds and general access at the Sand Point Property owned by the Lessor (not including park natural areas). Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, Lessor shall not be responsible for clearing snow, ice, obstructions and hazards from sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, walkways, steps, ramps and other paved surfaces in the Premises, or for repair of holes, cracks, or other defects in such surfaces. With regard to the streets serving the Premises, the City shall have only such obligations as the City has generally for all streets, and shall have no special obligations under this Amended Lease.

The Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, shall perform and comply with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, ordinances and Codes of The City of Seattle; the rules, regulations, orders, and directives of their administrative agencies and officers thereof; and all requirements associated with any fund source for the improvement of, or operations on, the Premises.

 12.4 Lead-based Paint. Lessee shall comply with all requirements of applicable laws and regulations with regard to lead-based paint. Without limiting the foregoing, Lessee shall comply with all requirements of federal regulations at 24 CFR Part 35, including regulations promulgated at 61 Federal Register 9063 et seq. with regard to disclosure of information concerning lead-based paint. In accordance with such regulations, Lessee shall provide the required information to, and shall obtain signed acknowledgments from, each residential Tenant of the Buildings, and shall provide copies of such documents to the Lessor upon the Lessor's request. To the extent that the Premises are subleased other than directly to residential Tenants, Lessee shall take all reasonable measures to cause each Sublessee to comply with the terms of this Section.

 12.5 Historic Preservation. Lessee shall comply, and shall take all reasonable measures to cause each Sublessee and Tenant (and the invitees and licensees of any of the foregoing) to comply, with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances concerning historic preservation, and with all provisions in the Navy Deed with respect to historic preservation. In addition, Lessee shall comply with all provisions of the Historic Property Reuse and Protection Plan to the extent it applies to the Premises. It shall be the sole

 responsibility of Lessee to make timely application for, and to obtain, any and all permits and approvals related to historic preservation in connection with any renovation, repairs, construction or excavation.

 12.6 U.S. Government and Funding Agency Restrictions. Lessee agrees to comply, and to take all reasonable measures to cause each Sublessee and Tenant, and all invitees or licensees of any of the foregoing, to comply with the terms and conditions of all covenants and restrictions imposed by the United States related to the transfer of the Sand Point Property to the Lessor, and of all agreements now or hereafter entered into by the Lessee or any Sublessee for the funding of the Improvements; the construction, maintenance, repair, or rehabilitation thereof; or the operations thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Lessee agrees that as between Lessee and Lessor, each and every covenant of "Grantee" in Navy Deed from the United States to the Lessor for the Premises, as such covenant relates to any Parcel of the Premises, for so long as this Amended Lease remains in effect as to such Parcel, shall be the obligation of Lessee, and that Lessee shall defend and indemnify Lessor from any liability, loss, damage or expense (including attorneys' and experts fees) arising from Lessee's breach of any such obligation. Lessee acknowledges that prior to the execution of this Amended Lease the Lessee has reviewed the Navy Deed.

 13. LIENS

 13.1 If, because of any act or omission of Lessee or any Sublessee, any mechanic or other lien or order for payment of money shall be filed against the Premises or the Improvements, Lessee shall at its sole expense cause the same to be discharged or bonded within thirty (30) days after the date of such filing.

 14. LIABILITY AND INSURANCE.

 14.1 Indemnity: The Lessee hereby releases the Lessor from, and shall indemnify and hold the Lessor harmless from, any and all losses, claims, actions, damages and expenses arising or that may arise in the future out of or resulting from any occurrence in or on the Premises, except to the extent, if any, that such losses, claims, actions, damages and expenses are proximately caused by either (a) the negligent or otherwise wrongful act of the Lessor or its employees, agents or contractors in violation either of a duty of care owed to the third party making a claim or of a duty owed by the Lessor to Lessee; or (b) the failure of the Lessor to perform an express obligation of the Lessor under this Amended Lease. Neither the approval by the Lessor of any action, omission or policy proposed by Lessee, nor the failure by the Lessor to enforce any obligation of Lessee or a Sublessee, shall give rise to an exception from the foregoing release and indemnity. In the event that any suit based upon such losses, claims, actions, damages, or expenses is brought against the Lessor, the Lessee, upon notice of the commencement thereof, shall defend the same by counsel satisfactory to the Lessor at Lessee's sole cost and expense (provided that the Lessor shall have the right to appear in and defend any such action by its own counsel); and if final judgment be adverse to the Lessor, or the Lessor and the Lessee jointly, or if the Lessor shall enter into a reasonable settlement of any such claim or action after notice to and consultation with Lessee, the Lessee shall promptly satisfy the same. Except as stated in clauses (a) and (b) of the first sentence of this Section, the obligation of Lessee to indemnify the Lessor described in this Section shall not be diminished by the fact, if it be a fact, that any such death, injury, damage, loss, cost or expense may have been contributed to, or may be alleged to have been contributed to, in part, by an act or omission of Lessor, its officers, employees or agents, provided that to the extent that RCW 4.24.115 (or successor provision) applies, (1) this indemnity shall not apply in case of any liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the Lessor, its agents or employees, and (2) in case of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of (a) Lessor or its agents or employees, and (b) Lessee or its agents or employees, this indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Lessee's negligence.

 14.2 Intentionally Deleted

 14.3 Worker's Compensation. Solely with respect to claims for indemnification under this Amended Lease, Lessee waives its immunity under Industrial Insurance laws. This section has been negotiated by the parties as indicated by their initials below, and Lessee acknowledges that the Lessor would not enter into this Amended Lease absent this Section. Lessee shall ensure that the provisions of this Section are incorporated in any Sublease and are binding on the Sublessee for the benefit of the Lessor.

If available funds are insufficient for complete repair, restoration or replacement, but partial repair, restoration or replacement is feasible, then unless otherwise agreed by Lessor, the Lessee shall proceed with such partial repair, restoration or replacement. Lessee shall be obligated to provide for such purposes funds equal to any deductible or co-insurance amount for which Lessee is responsible under Article 14. Repairs, replacement or rebuilding shall be made by Lessee in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Amended Lease.

 15.2 Notice Prior to Commencement of Work. Lessee shall give Lessor at least thirty (30) days notice prior to the commencement of such work described in Section 15.1.

For the cost of the repairs, replacement or rebuilding, Lessor shall authorize disbursement of funds from the account established pursuant to Section 14.7, as Lessee shall make such repair, replacement or rebuilding, and during the progress of the work, upon Lessee's written requisitions accompanied by certificates of an architect or engineer reasonably satisfactory to Lessor certifying that the work is in accordance with Construction Plans approved by Lessor and the percentage completion thereof, upon delivery of such other evidence as Lessor may reasonably require that such work is in place and paid for, and subject to holdback of five percent (5%) of the amount of each requisition until completion of the work. If, during the course of the work, any lien or order for

 the payment of money shall be filed against the Premises or Improvements thereon, or against Lessor, or if Lessee shall be in default of the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Amended Lease, Lessor shall not be obligated to authorize any payment to Lessee of insurance proceeds until and unless the liens or orders have been fully bonded, satisfied or discharged of record and until the default has been cured by Lessee.

If such options are exercised by either party, the Amended Lease as to such Parcel(s) shall wholly cease and expire on the date specified in the notice in which event Lessee shall not be obligated to rebuild, provided, that any such insurance proceeds received or receivable under any and all policies of insurance shall then belong to and be retained by Lessor.

If the Improvements remaining shall be insufficient for the reasonable operation of Lessee's residential complex and/or social and human services to tenants, either party may terminate the Amended Lease with ninety (90) days notice.

 16. INSPECTION

Lessee shall permit Lessor, its agents and employees, to enter the Premises and Improvements at reasonable hours for the purpose of inspecting them or (at Lessor's sole option) making repairs that Lessee may neglect or refuse to make in accordance with the terms, covenants and conditions of the Amended Lease. Lessee's permission shall not constitute any indemnity nor create any liability concerning claims or causes of action by Sublessees or Tenants related to such entering or inspection, except that Lessee shall indemnify Lessor for any liability, loss, damage or expense to Lessor resulting from any failure by Lessee to include, in any Sublease or other agreement with a Sublessee, the rights of Lessor contemplated by this Section. Except as stated in the previous sentence, Lessor shall hold harmless, defend and indemnify Lessee from any liability for injury or death to persons or damage to property, in each case to the extent directly resulting from the wrongful or negligent actions (not omissions) of the Lessor, its agents and employees in the course of such entering or inspection.

 20.4 Partial Termination. If the Amended Lease shall be terminated as to a portion of the Premises only, then the above provisions of this Article shall apply only to such portion and all Improvements thereon, together with all related Personal Property.

 20.5 Survival of Liabilities. Any liability of Lessee or Lessor hereunder for negligent or intentional acts or omissions occurring during the Term of this Amended Lease, or arising under the indemnity provisions of this Amended Lease, shall survive termination and surrender (whether or not any claim giving rise to such liability shall have accrued).

 22. QUIET ENJOYMENT

 22.1 Lessor covenants that, subject to the express provisions of this Amended Lease, to the interests of Sublessees and Tenants, and to the terms of the conveyance of the Premises from the United States, if and so long as Lessee pays the Rent and other charges required by the Amended Lease, and performs all of its obligations pursuant to the terms, covenants and conditions of the Amended Lease, Lessee shall quietly enjoy the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Amended Lease, Lessor's covenants and warranty as to title to the Premises are limited to the agreement of Lessor to warrant and defend such title, subject to the express provisions of this Amended Lease, against all persons lawfully claiming or to claim by, through or under Lessor, and Lessor expressly disclaims all other covenants and warranties.

 23. LESSOR'S CONSENT OR APPROVAL

 23.1 Consent Expressly for Lease Purposes; Discretion of Lessor. Whenever Lessor's consent or approval in writing to any act to be performed by Lessee is required under the Amended Lease, (a) Lessee must obtain a consent or approval in writing expressly for purposes of this Amended Lease, regardless of whether a consent or approval shall have been granted by the Lessor in its regulatory, public utility, or other capacity; and (b) unless otherwise expressly stated herein, such consent or approval may be withheld in the Lessor's sole discretion, exercised in good faith. In any case in which it is stated that the Lessor's consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Lessee agrees that valid reasons for withholding consent or approval shall include the Lessor's desire to maintain or ensure compliance with any of the following: any law, regulation, ordinance, or grant agreement; any Comprehensive Plan policy; any provision of the Sand Point Physical Development Management Plan or of the Community Preferred Re-use Plan for Sand Point (except as the same shall have been modified or superseded by any of the foregoing); any of the plans or guidelines described in Section 32.2 below; any City of Seattle adopted neighborhood plan policy; any provision of the Lessor's Consolidated Plan; or any condition attached to any federal, state, or county funding, provided such withholding is reasonably related to such purpose.

No such consent or approval shall be construed as any representation or assurance that the matter consented to or approved complies with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances or Codes, nor shall any such consent or approval be construed to authorize any failure to comply with any of the foregoing. It shall be the sole obligation of the Lessee to obtain, at its own expense, all regulatory approvals, consents, permits, and licenses necessary or convenient for the development of the Premises from all relevant authorities, including without limitation any permits from the Lessor's Department of Planning and Development. Nothing herein shall be construed as assurance that any such approvals will be granted or that the City, as Lessor, will grant consents, approvals or modifications hereunder for the purpose of compliance with the conditions of any permit, approval, license or funding agreement sought or obtained by Lessee.

 24. NO DISQUALIFICATION

 24.1 Lessor and Lessee represent and warrant that they are not disqualified under federal, state or other laws, or under the rules or regulations of any governmental department or authority, from acquiring, owning, leasing and holding any interest in real property or from obtaining any government contract.

 31. PROCESS FOR ALTERNATIVES BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

 31.1 Events Requiring Renegotiation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended Lease, if (a) an environmental review conducted under 24 CFR Section 586.45(a) after HUD's approval of the Lessor's application for the Premises indicates that any part of the Premises is not suitable for the intended purpose; or (b) after review under the State Environmental Policy Act ("SEPA") the Lessor determines that any of the uses or actions contemplated in this Amended Lease or the Application may have an adverse effect on the environment that cannot be sufficiently mitigated without modification of such contemplated uses or actions, then in any such case the parties shall follow the process set forth in Section 31.2 to negotiate alternative arrangements that would enable the same balance of interests made originally.

 31.2 Balance of Interests. Within fifteen (15) days after notice to either Lessor or Lessee of any of the circumstances set forth in Section 31.1, representatives of the Lessor, Lessee and any intended Sublessee affected by such circumstances shall meet to discuss alternatives designed to achieve substantially the same balance of interests as originally contemplated in the Application. Alternatives may include, without limitation, acquisition by the Lessee or any such Sublessee of alternative real property instead of any portion of the Premises that proves unsuitable for the purposes intended. Within thirty (30) days after such meeting, Lessee shall present to the Director and Committees in writing one or more alternatives. The Director shall make available such alternatives and any others selected by the Director, for public comment, and shall hold one or more community meetings to discuss such alternatives. Following such meeting(s) and any additional review or process required by applicable laws or ordinances, the Mayor or Director shall propose to the City Council a preferred alternative, with any other alternatives deemed feasible by the Mayor or Director. If the City Council approves any such alternative, then the Council shall authorize an appropriate amendment to this Amended Lease and any other actions it deems necessary to implement the selected alternative.

 31.3 Amendment of Amended Lease. If the City Council authorizes an amendment to this Amended Lease pursuant to Section 31.2 above, then the Lessor may give written notice to the Lessee of an amendment that the Lessor requires in the terms of this Amended Lease. The Lessee shall have fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice to deliver to the Lessor its written acceptance of such amendment. If such acceptance is not delivered or is made subject to any conditions by the Lessee, then at any time after the expiration of such 15-day period the Lessor shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Amended Lease, either as to the Premises as a whole or, if deemed feasible by the Lessor, as to the Parcel or Parcels of the Premises affected by the proposed amendment, by written notice to the Lessee. Upon such termination neither party shall have any liability to the other, except for such liabilities as expressly survive the termination of this Amended Lease in accordance with the terms hereof.

 32. ADVISORY COMMITTEES; COMPLIANCE WITH PLANS AND GUIDELINES

 32.1 Magnuson Park Community Communications Committee; Representation; Provision of Information. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Lessor has established a committee, which includes representatives of Lessee, owners, tenants and users of other portions of the Sand Point Property, as well as representatives of the Lessor and neighborhood interests, to coordinate activities on the Sand Point Property and community involvement therein (the "Magnuson Park Community Communications Committee"). Lessee shall be entitled to representation on the Magnuson Park Community Communications Committee and shall participate and cooperate in good faith in the processes established by the Magnuson Park Community Communications Committee.

 (a) Lessor agrees that if Lessor has any termination right arising solely out of portions of the Sand Point Property other than a portion of the Premises subleased to a limited partnership or limited liability company that is organized on terms acceptable to the Housing Director with intent to claim low income housing tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code and that has received a contribution of capital from one or more investor members or investor limited partners (collectively, the "Investor") approved by the Housing Director (the portion of the Premises so subleased and any Improvements thereon are hereafter referred to as the "Partnership Property"), Lessor shall not exercise any remedy with respect to the Partnership Property, including without limitation any termination of the Amended Lease with respect thereto, but may pursue its remedies as to all or part of the Premises, and Improvements thereon, other than the Partnership Property.

 (b) Lessor agrees that solely as a result of any default under this Amended Lease that relates to the Partnership Property it shall not terminate the Ground Lease as to the Partnership Property or any portion thereof, nor deprive or commence any action to deprive Sublessee of possession of the Partnership Property, until at least sixty (60) days after written notice as provided below in this subsection (b). The foregoing sentence shall not prevent Lessor from giving any notice to Lessee or Sublessee. Lessor agrees to accept performance by the Investor or the Sublessee as curing Lessee's defaults under this Amended Lease. If Lessee fails to cure any default within the time limit allowed under this Amended Lease or if there is a default for which no time to cure is allowed to Lessee, then Lessor may terminate this Amended Lease for such default only after sixty (60) days notice of such failure to cure given to the Sublessee of the Partnership Property and to the Investor if the Lessor shall have been provided a current address for the Investor. Lessor shall not terminate the Amended Lease for such default (i) if the Investor or Sublessee cures such default within such sixty days; or (ii) with respect to any default that is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such period, if Investor or Sublessee begins cure within such sixty day period, so long as the Investor or Sublessee proceeds diligently and continuously to complete such cure, and provided that such cure is completed in no less than 12 months, unless extended by the Housing Director in his or her discretion.

 (c) The Investor shall not have any obligation to cure any default.
