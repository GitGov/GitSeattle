 AN ORDINANCE relating to transportation capital projects; amending the 2004 budget and the 2004-2009 Capital Improvement Program to reduce authorized spending on the Mercer Corridor Project and authorize spending on other transportation capital projects.

 WHEREAS, in the 2004 budget the Council adopted a budget proviso that limited expenditures on the Mercer Corridor Project to $163,000 without further Council ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the proviso stated that prior to the Council's authorizing spending additional funds, the Council and the Executive would "work together to agree on standards for inclusion of alternatives in an EIS and the information necessary to support those standards;"

 WHEREAS, although the Executive has proposed legislation for funding the EIS, the Council has not passed legislation identifying alternatives for the Mercer Corridor Project; and

 WHEREAS, Council staff concluded, "based on the Executive's traffic analysis, that the Two-way Mercer improvements will do little or nothing to keep the already severe congestion in SLU from getting significantly worse in the future, i.e., it will not improve mobility for either the neighborhood or people passing through;" and

 WHEREAS, Council staff also concluded that "it is highly questionable that the Two-way Mercer improvements will support the desired growth in SLU, foster greater transit use, or effectively reconnect SLU with nearby neighborhoods;" and

 WHEREAS, Council staff further concluded that the projected increase in congestion in SLU will detract from pedestrians' and bicyclists' enjoyment of new paths, street, crossings and other amenities included in the Two-way Mercer improvements as well as hinder transit movements, thereby discouraging use; and

 WHEREAS, the Council cannot justify a $200 million investment in the Mercer corridor that will allow congestion to continue to get worse at a time when the City is unable to make a sufficient investment in its roads and bridges to keep them from seriously deteriorating; and

 WHEREAS, the Citizen's Transportation Advisory Committee II recently completed a report with the finding that the backlog of deferred maintenance for Seattle streets, arterials, bridges and sidewalks is currently about $500 million with maintenance costs alone to reduce the backlog requiring about $40-$50 million in additional funding each year over the next 20 years; and

 WHEREAS, additional findings of the Citizen's Transportation Advisory Committee II show that the Seattle Department of Transportation should be replacing one bridge every year, but current funding allows replacement of one bridge every 3 or 4 years; and

 WHEREAS, the 12th Avenue South - Jose Rizal Bridge Deck Repair is one of many unfunded major projects from SDOT's 2005-10 CIP; and

 WHEREAS, since 1990, the City has actually lost transportation revenue sources because the 1995 Supreme Court ruling that the Street Utility Fee as unconstitutional, in 2002 voter approved Initiative 776 eliminating the Vehicle License Fee from City revenues, and fuel tax revenues have declined more than 35 percent since 1996; and

 WHEREAS, the City's options for transportation revenues are limited at this time, while the need for transportation infrastructure maintenance and improvement is growing. As the condition of the transportation infrastructure deteriorates, it becomes significantly more expensive to repair or replace - effectively doubling every 10 to 15 years.

 NOW, THEREFORE,
