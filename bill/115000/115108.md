 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the acquisition of long-term firm transmission capacity for the purpose of transmitting the energy from the Stateline wind project.

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance Number 120529, the City entered into a 20-year purchase of energy and environmental attributes associated with 175 MW of wind generating capacity from the Stateline Wind Project and an associated 10-year agreement for delivery of nearly all of such power to the Mid-Columbia trading hub; and

 WHEREAS, in recognition of the lack of ability to secure firm delivery of the project output past 2011, the power purchase agreement provided that if PPM Energy (the seller) of the power were to release any of the up to 165 MW of firm transmission that it controlled, City Light would have first right of refusal on that transmission; and

 WHEREAS, the seller has offered City Light such transmission in the form of two contracts, one for 60 MW annually (the "60 MW Contract"), and another for 80 MW for the period June through October and 105 MW for the period November through May (the "80/105 MW Contract"), all to take effect December 1, 2004; and

 WHEREAS, City Light has determined that acquiring the 80/105 MW Contract is prudent to ensure reasonable delivery of the Stateline Wind Project output to the Mid-Columbia trading hub past 2011; and

 WHEREAS, PacifiCorp, the transmission supplier, has agreed that City Light is an eligible customer that can take assignment of PPM Energy's transmission rights; and

 WHEREAS, PPM Energy and PacifiCorp have agreed that City Light may assume the 80/105 MW Contract held by PPM Energy and may forego the 60 MW Contract held by PPM Energy; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee (the ("Superintendent"), is hereby authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle (the "City"), an agreement between the City, PacifiCorp and PPM Energy for assignment of long- term firm point-to-point transmission rights, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A entitled, "Amendatory Agreement for Assignment of Transmission Rights." The transmission service is purchased from PacifiCorp Transmission on an annual renewal basis and is for long-term firm point-to-point transmission from the Wallula substation, the location of the interconnection of the Stateline Wind Project with PacifiCorp's transmission system, to the Mid-Columbia trading hub to include the Wanapum bus in Grant County. The transmission rights acquired by Exhibit A may be deferred for up to five years by payment of one month's transmission costs.

 Section 2. Assumption of the transmission rights as described in Exhibit A will require the City to pay a fixed rate per MW per month of transmission capacity purchased, unless such transmission rights are deferred. The City intends to defer such transmission rights for up to five years by paying an annual fee equal to one month's charge while deferring the service. Deferring the transmission service does not release the City from the obligation to take at least one full year of service.

 Section 3. Except for the obligation to take at least one full year of service, the transmission rights are subject to an annual renewal election by the City. Accordingly, the Superintendent is authorized to annually renew the transmission rights described in Exhibit A, or whatever portion thereof City Light deems prudent in light of the Stateline Power Purchase Agreement.

 Section 4. Despite its right to annually renew such transmission, the City may lose its priority to the transmission rights if another customer of the transmission provider offers to take such transmission on a multiyear basis. If the transmission provider received a multiyear offer, the City would be provided with thirty (30) days' notice to match such offer. If the City did not match the offer within thirty (30) days, the transmission provider would be free to sell the transmission rights to the alternate customer. Consequently, the Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby further authorized to execute additional transmission services agreements for the transmission rights described in Exhibit A as needed to ensure that City Light has the ability to protect its transmission rights received under Exhibit A. This additional authority shall also include authority to reassign such transmission rights for any period of time before 2011, or the termination of the Integration and Exchange Agreement with PacifiCorp Transmission relating to the Stateline Power Purchase Agreement, whichever is earlier, so long as such acts are consistent with the purpose of this ordinance.

 Section 5. In the event any contracts are contemplated under the authority granted in Section 4, City Light shall without delay, provide a detailed report, complete with analysis, to the Council explaining the purposes and impacts of such agreements prior to its execution.

 Section 6. Any acts taken in furtherance of this ordinance, but prior to its effective date, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
