Facility use agreements with terms in excess of two years shall be subject to review by the Director of Finance.

 The Director shall promulgate rules and guidelines containing regulations and standards for the application of fees, charges, and terms and conditions of use for Seattle Center facilities that are consistent with the policies expressed herein.

 2. DEFINITIONS

 a. "Event" means the purpose for which a facility has been contracted, such as a meeting, show, competition, performance, festival, etc., and includes all related activities such as move- in/move-out, rehearsal, practice, and other activities of the Event. There are three types of Events:

 1) "Government Agency Event" means an Event contracted by an agency of the federal government, State of Washington, any municipal corporation or other special or general purpose unit of local government in the State of Washington; or any legally constituted public governing body with multi-jurisdictional authority, one jurisdiction of which is within the State of Washington, or any quasi-governmental entity or company created solely for conducting the business of one or more of such government entities and subject solely to the rules and regulations thereof for official governmental purposes.

 2) "Spectator Event" means any Event open to the public and held in the KeyArena, Exhibition Hall, Fisher Pavilion, or Marion Oliver McCaw Hall, where admission to the Event's principal activity is ticketed, except for trade or consumer shows, private meetings or conventions.

 3) "Standard Event" means any Event that is not a Spectator Event or Government Agency Event.

 b. "Concession Fee" means a fee charged either as a percentage of sales or at a flat rate for the right to sell merchandise and/or food and beverages at an Event.

 c. "Director" means the Director of the Seattle Center Department or the Director's designee.

 d. "Facility" means a room, building, or outdoor space at Seattle Center that can be rented by the public.

 3. CLIENT USE OF FACILITIES

 a. USE FEES: The Director is authorized to establish from time to time a schedule of facility use fees (the "Rate Card") consistent with Attachment A, "the ~~2005 and 2006~~2007 and 2008 Seattle Center Fee Schedule", and taking into account the following City policies: (i) that the Rate Card shall be administered the same to any entity that qualifies to use a Seattle Center facility; and (ii) that fees be competitive in the marketplace and be anticipated to return reasonable revenue to Seattle Center relative to operational costs. The Rate Card may set fees according to event type, size of venue, or on any other basis consistent with the above policy.

 The Director may negotiate fees for intermittent use of miscellaneous facilities and portions of facilities that are not identified in Attachment A, based on the policies described above, and taking into consideration market conditions and other legitimate business

 concerns.

 A separate use fee will be charged for each Use Period. Use fees shown on a Rate Card are minimum use fees. Where percentages of  net gross sales apply above a minimum use fee, the Director may negotiate a maximum use fee. In-kind consideration such as complimentary tickets, or services such as guest appearances, may be negotiated as part of the overall consideration for use of a Facility. The Director shall promulgate a Complimentary Ticket Use Policy governing the use of complimentary tickets which shall be consistent with the City of Seattle Ethics Code.

 b. FACILITY SURCHARGES: The Director is authorized to collect an additional use fee on Spectator Events in KeyArena and McCaw Hall based on the number of tickets sold, and to establish a schedule of per-ticket rates consistent with Attachment A. The basis for computing the Facility Surcharge may include complimentary tickets. The Director shall promulgate guidelines governing the application of the Facility Surcharge, which guidelines shall be based on sound business practice, be in the City's best interest, and be related to the goals for Seattle Center.

 c. USE FEE PAYMENTS: The full amount of the use fee is due prior to the Event for Standard Events; an executed purchase order is required prior to the Event for Government Agency Events. For Spectator Events, a deposit is due prior to the Event with the remainder due at settlement for the Event. Money paid to the City shall be in the form of legal tender of the United States of America. Goods and services with a wholesale value that is equal to or greater than the use Fee may be accepted in partial or full payment, subject to City of Seattle purchasing rules.

 The Director is authorized to determine due dates for the return of use agreements and for payments, including installment payments, that take into consideration the fiscal responsibility of Seattle Center and sound business practices including the reasonable amount of time that is needed to re-let a space if a deadline is not met; the financial history of repeat clients; the time needed to set up the space without incurring additional labor costs and the time needed for the user to return the use agreement with the initial payment.

 d. CONTINGENCY DEPOSIT: A deposit(s) may be required to be paid prior to an Event to cover some portion of the estimated labor, parking fees, equipment charges, services, damage or other incidental charges anticipated to be incurred during the Event, or as partial security for payment-in-full of all Event-related expenses. Any portion of the deposit remaining after deductions are made to pay a user's Event expenses shall be refunded to the user. The Director may waive this deposit(s) based on a history of reliable payment by a user or lack of charges incurred during past Events of

 that user.

 e. CANCELLATION FEES: The Director may assess reasonable Cancellation Fees for Events or portions of Events that are cancelled within a certain time period prior to the Event as specified in the use agreement. In determining whether to assess a Cancellation Fee, the Director shall employ sound business practices including the time characteristically needed to book a new Event in the same type of space; the user's past Event history; and the financial consequences to Seattle Center if the Event is cancelled.

 f. TRANSFER FEES: To accommodate users' needs and maintain good business relationships, and subject to availability, Seattle Center may permit users to change contracted Event dates and/or spaces when doing so does not have a negative financial impact on Seattle Center. A transfer fee may be charged if the request is made close to the time of the Event.

 g. ORIGINATION FEES: The Director may assess Origination Fees based on industry standards for the right to take photographs, broadcast a performance live, or make a video and/or audio recording at an Event at Seattle Center. The Director may accept the user's promotion of Seattle Center in partial or full payment of the Origination Fee provided that the value of the promotion is equal to or exceeds the value of the Origination Fee.

 h. CATERING FEES: The Director may collect fees for catering services provided to guests at Events in facilities at Seattle Center. For Seattle Center Productions Events, the Director may include this fee as part of Seattle Center's Event sponsorship.

 i. FOOD AND BEVERAGE CONCESSIONS: The Director may collect Concessions Fees for sales of food and beverages by users of spaces not subject to an exclusive food and beverage concession agreement, unless the Event is a food fair. The Director shall establish guidelines with a table of charges based on the number of concession stands, the expected attendance and an estimated per capita expenditure by guests at the Event. The Director may combine this charge with other charges and fees.

 j. PROGRAM AND NOVELTY CONCESSION FEES: The Director may collect Concession Fees at any Event in a Major Facility, the Center House main floor area, or outdoor spaces at which users or their agents sell programs and novelty items. The fee shall not apply to exhibitors at an exhibit show who have contracted for booth space from the user. The Director may combine this charge with other charges and fees.

 The Director may enter into concession agreements with terms of up to five years giving the concessionaire the exclusive right to sell such items at Spectator Events in specific facilities. In negotiating such agreements, the Director shall negotiate the terms favorable for Seattle Center and shall require that sales be conducted in a professional manner that accommodates the needs of both Seattle Center and the users of the concessionaire's services.

 k. REFUNDS: The Director may refund fees to make amends to dissatisfied users for failures in service by Seattle Center or Event vendors or for such other reasons as the Director may determine are fair and reasonable.

 l. OPERATIONAL TERMS:

 1) Services and Equipment: Certain services and equipment will be provided by Seattle Center on the day(s) of an Event in consideration of use fees paid. These services are specified in the use agreement or listed in the applicable Facility Addenda that shall be attached to the use agreement.

 Certain other services and equipment may be required or made available for an additional charge, which shall be described in addenda to the use agreement. The charges in these addenda shall be based on the Director's assessment of competitive fees in the marketplace and anticipated revenue generation for Seattle Center relative to the operational costs of buying, maintaining and replacing equipment and of supplying services.

 The Director may enter into service provider agreements with terms of not more than five years, securing event-related services at rates favorable to the City and under provisions requiring the services to be performed in a professional manner that accommodates the needs of both the Seattle Center and any user who uses these services.

 2) Cleaning Between Performances: For the safety of attendees to an Event, and to maintain Seattle Center's standards of appearance for the facility, the Director may require users to pay for cleaning between multiple performances on the same day.

 3). Hours of Use: The Director may determine the hours of the day that an Event may be open at Seattle Center.

 m. SPECIAL CONDITIONS: The Director is authorized to vary from the established Rate Card only for sound business purposes and only if such variance is available to any user. The reasons for variance shall be contained in Seattle Center rules and guidelines, be in the City's best interest, and be related to the stated goals for Seattle Center, including generating revenue. The Director may negotiate terms and conditions for use that combine use fees with other charges and sources of revenue related to an Event; may waive fees or portions of fees; and negotiate terms that create benefits for Seattle Center in addition to use fees.

 4. SEATTLE CENTER PRODUCTIONS EVENTS

 The Director is authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements to sponsor Events at Seattle Center. These Events shall comply with the Guidelines for Seattle Center Co-Sponsored Events.

For these Events, all sources of Event revenue and Event-related expenses may be shared with the co-promoter. Co-promotion decisions shall be made judiciously for sound business reasons with the intent of achieving Seattle Center goals, increasing use of the facilities and maximizing revenue for the City. Approval by the Director of Finance is required for agreements where the City's risk for potential loss, excluding the cost of facility rental, exceeds $50,000.

 6. EVENTS PROMOTED BY SEATTLE CENTER

The Director is authorized to enter into agreements as a promoter of Events in any Facility. For these Events, City shall retain all sources of Event revenue and shall be responsible for all Event- related expenses. Decisions to self-promote Events shall be made judiciously for sound business reasons with the intent of achieving Seattle Center goals, increasing use of the facilities and maximizing revenue for the City.
