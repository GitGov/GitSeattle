 Exhibit 1 to Department Of Finance 3rd Quarter Supplemental Ordinance Fleets and Facilities Department Capital Improvement Program Information

 Title: Utility Payment Center

 Project ID A1GM106 Project Start Q4/2005 Type Rehabilitation or Restoration Project End Q4/2006 BCL Name: General Government Facilities - General BCL Code: A1GM1

 Project Location(s) Location: 600 4th Ave Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan N/A Neighborhood District: Downtown Urban Commercial Core

 Description

 This project creates a customer-friendly and accessible utility payment center in the 5th Avenue lobby of Seattle City Hall, in the vacant, semi-raw space behind the privately leased existing coffee cart (along the northern wall west of the Department of Neighborhoods' Citizen Service Bureau). The utility payment center allows the City's utility customers easy access to assistance in paying utility bills and other related customer service performed by Seattle Public Utilities, Seattle City Light, and Department of Executive Administration.

 The project is predominantly funded by the utilities ($634,000), with a smaller portion funded from non-utility capital funds ($179,000) for space to be occupied by DEA staff and/or equipment. The $179,000 from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund is included in the table below and proposed 3rd Quarter 2005 Supplemental legislation. There are no increased operational costs to FFD because of the project, but there are increased staffing requirements in DEA that have been included in that department's operating budget.
