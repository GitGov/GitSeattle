 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to taxicabs; revising the requirements for a demonstration project to determine the feasibility of wheelchair accessible taxicabs; specifying requirements for installation of digital security cameras in all taxicabs; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 6.310.110, 6.310.320, 6.310.330, 6.310.455, 6.310.500, and 6.310.600.

 WHEREAS, through a grant, King County is implementing a demonstration project to determine the viability of wheelchair accessible taxicabs, which will also serve the general public; and

 WHEREAS, because taxicabs generally operate regionally and require licenses issued by both the City of Seattle and by King County, it is appropriate for the City to issue temporary, non-transferable taxicab licenses to individual for-hire drivers selected by King County through its wheelchair accessible taxicab demonstration project; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121738, adopted earlier this year, requires all taxicabs operating in Seattle after September 1, 2005 to be equipped with digital security cameras, revisions to that requirement are necessary to protect both individual privacy concerns and the digital images for use as evidence in the investigation and prosecution of criminal activities; NOW, THEREFORE,

An individual person may be a taxicab association as long as that individual owns or represents at least fifteen (15) taxicabs and otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter; provided, that for taxicab associations formed in connection with the wheelchair accessible taxicab demonstration project provided for under this chapter, the Director may waive the requirement for such taxicab associations to have fifteen (15) licensed taxicabs and any taxicab association license fee for the duration of the demonstration project.
