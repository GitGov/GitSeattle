 July 13, 2005

 Version #2

 Attachment1: Coordinated Bargaining

 TENTATIVE AGREEMENT Between the City of Seattle And The Coalition of City Unions

 May 25, 2005

 A. WAGES

 1. Effective December 29, 2004, wages will be increased 2.5%.

 2. Effective December 28, 2005, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2003 through June 2004 to the period August 2004 through June 2005.

 3. Effective December 27, 2006, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2004 through June 2005 to the period August 2005 through June 2006.

 4. For 2006 and 2007, the percentage increases shall be at least two percent (2%) and not more than seven percent (7%).

 B. HEALTH CARE

 1. For the 2005 contract term, employee premium sharing and the status of the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be maintained as determined by the Health Care Committee at the last meeting of the Committee in September, 2004. In addition, The City will pay the equivalent of $1 million, annualized, for enhanced benefits implemented in 2005, which shall become a part of the "base" for the future City's cost obligations. The specific benefit enhancements will be determined by HC2. Further, the parties agree that eleven thousand dollars ($11,000) shall be utilized from the "Special" Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) for the purpose of paying Aon Consulting to complete an analysis of the City's self-insured claims experience to identify potential Wellness and Disease Management Programs that would be best targeted to address the City's claims experience. Also, the parties commit to support Wellness and Disease Management Programs identified as a result of the Aon study for implementation in 2006, utilizing "Special" RSF through the Health Care Committee processes.

 2. The parties agree to amend for the 2006 and 2007 contract years the Memorandum of Agreement previously established by the parties to govern the Joint Labor-Management Health Care Committee process (which shall be attached hereto as Exhibit I and by reference is incorporated herein) as follows:

 a) The City shall pay up to one hundred seven percent (107%) of the City's previous year's costs to the extent required to cover increases in the total health care costs for a given program year (e.g. 2006 or 2007);

 b) The RSF shall be utilized for any given program year until it is exhausted to cover costs in excess of the City's obligation identified in 1, above;

 c) After the RSF has been exhausted, additional costs shall be shared by the City paying eighty-five percent (85%) of the excess costs and employees paying fifteen percent (15%) of the excess costs;

 d) Intent: Plan designs are to be maintained during this Contract, not to be diminished. The respective health care plan benefit designs may only be modified by the Health Care Committee for either contract year by the written, mutual agreement of the parties (Coalition of City Unions and the City);

 e) Intent: Should the parties agree to reduce premium costs, the reduction would apply to City as well as employee premiums. Use of resources from the RSF during either contract year to reduce projected increase in health care costs that exceed the resources provided through 1, above, shall be authorized only if applied to the total, annual premiums of the respective health care plan(s); and

 f) No decision by the Health Care Committee shall be permitted that modifies the established percentages established in c), above.

 C. VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACCOUNT (VEBA)

 1. Beginning in the 2006 year of the agreement, any ratified collective bargaining agreement that contractually requires the placement of all employee sick leave cash-out resources at retirement into a VEBA account for use by the respective employee for post- retirement health care costs as allowed under the IRS regulations associated with such accounts will include an increase in the cash- out value of sick leave at retirement from twenty-five percent (25%) to thirty-five percent (35%).

 2. In addition to the cash-out of sick leave at retirement as provided herein, on an annual basis during the month of January, commencing in January of 2006, any active employee who would have a sick leave balance of at least 240 hours following the cash-out of accrued sick leave as described as follows may, by execution of the appropriate payroll authorization, cash out up to fifty percent (50%) of the unused sick leave allocation said employee accrued during the prior fiscal year at the cash-out value of thirty-five percent (35%) for placement in said employee's VEBA account in accordance with and for the uses as provided by applicable IRS regulations associated with such accounts. For example, if a given employee had a sick leave balance of 288 hours on January 1, 2006, and said employee used two days of sick leave from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2005, said employee could, by execution of the appropriate payroll authorization, cash out up to 40 hours of sick leave at a cash-out value of 35% for placement in the employee's VEBA account.

 D. SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLANS

 The City agrees to assess, on the basis of a specific proposal made by a Coalition Union either as part of the Coalition coordinated bargaining process or as part of the individual contract negotiations with a given Union, the acceptability to the City of a given supplemental pension proposal as a policy matter and respond promptly to the Union making such a proposal whether, and/or under what conditions, such a proposal would be acceptable.

 E. SICK LEAVE

 The definition of "Eligible family member" contained in SMC 4.24.005 shall be amended by the elimination of the existing phrase "who is (a) under eighteen (18) years of age; or (b) eighteen (18) years of age or older and incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability" and the addition of the word "sibling."

 The expressed purpose for the proposed modification of said definition shall be to allow an employee to use sick leave because of an illness, injury, or health care appointment of an employee's sibling or adult child, or the sibling or adult child of an employee's spouse or domestic partner, in instances where the absence of the employee from work is required, or when such absence is recommended by a health care provider.

 F. PAY FOR DEPLOYED MILITARY

 All collective bargaining agreements established as a part of these negotiations shall be amended to include the following language:

 "A bargaining unit member in the Reserves, National Guard, or Air National Guard who is deployed on extended unpaid military leave of absence and whose military pay (plus adjustments) is less than ninety percent (90%) of their base pay as a City employee shall receive the difference between ninety percent (90%) of their City base pay and their military pay (plus adjustments).

 City base pay shall include every part of wages except overtime.

 G. PERSONAL HOLIDAYS

 If the 2005 year-end actuarial study commissioned by the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System (hereinafter, "System") reports that the amortization period for the System's unfunded actuarial liability does not exceed thirty (30) years and, therefore, no increase in the City's contribution level is required, the parties to this tentative agreement shall, upon the written request to the City by the Unions that are a party to this agreement, enter into negotiations solely and exclusively with respect to the issue of whether and/or to what extent and/or in what manner the number of Personal Holidays available to employees shall be increased.

 H. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS

 The following shall be incorporated into each collective bargaining agreement that is the result of the coordinated bargaining process with the Coalition of City Unions:

 For All Coalition Unions Covered by a Corresponding Provision as Part of the 2001 Coalition Bargaining Process; and for Teamsters, Local 117, Evidence Warehouser/CSO's; and for WSCCCE, Local 21-P (PEO's)

 The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspective(s) as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective August 18, 2004, employees who participate in bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

 1. Bargaining preparation and meetings of the Union's bargaining team other than actual negotiations shall not be applicable to this provision;

 2. No more than an aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision.

 3. If the aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours is exceeded, the Union shall reimburse the City for the cost of said employee(s) time, including any associated overtime costs.

 For Joint Crafts Council

 The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspective(s) as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective August 18, 2004, employees who participate in bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

 1. Bargaining preparation and meetings of the Union's bargaining team other than actual negotiations shall not be applicable to this provision;

 2. No more than an aggregate of one hundred (100) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision for both Coordinated Bargaining with the Coalition of City Unions and bargaining on the Joint Crafts Council "boilerplate" language.

 3. In addition to the above, no more than an aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision for bargaining on the Joint Crafts Council Appendices.

 4. If the aggregate of one hundred (150) hours is exceeded, the Union shall reimburse the City for the cost of said employee(s) time, including any associated overtime costs.

 Established this 25th day of May, 2005.

 Attachment 1, Exhibit 1: MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE and the SIGNATORY UNIONS

 LABOR-MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE

 This Memorandum of Agreement (hereinafter, "MOA"), describes the processes and time frames agreed to between the City and the signatory Unions governing the medical, dental and vision, life, long term disability, long term care and employee assistance program benefits for all benefits-eligible employees represented by Unions that are a party to this MOA, including the changes thereto and premiums established through the Labor-Management Health Care Committee (hereinafter "Committee") in accordance with the provisions contained herein.

 I. CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS

 Each Union that is a party to this MOA shall adopt and incorporate as part of their applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, a provision that authorizes the Labor-Management Health Care Committee to govern benefit plans for all benefits-eligible employees represented by said Union, including premiums and changes thereto, in accordance with the provisions of this MOA.

 II. DEFINITIONS

 As utilized in this MOA, the term "total average plan cost of medical, dental and vision premiums" means the cost of premiums not diminished by funds from the Rate Stabilization Fund applied to reduce City and employee costs, which shall be determined using the following calculation:

 For each program year of January 1, through December 31, after 2005, multiply the number of City employees covered by this MOA in each medical plan, as of June 30, of the applicable program year by the respective monthly medical plan premiums charged departments and the respective monthly premiums paid by those employees to determine the total monthly medical premiums. Divide the resulting total by the total number of employees covered by this MOA to determine the average monthly plan medical premium. Conduct the same calculations for the dental and vision plans. Total the average monthly medical, dental and vision plan premiums derived from these calculations, add to this total the monthly amount utilized if any from the Rate Stabilization Fund referenced in IV, below, to reduce City and employee costs, and multiply by twelve to determine the total average plan cost, as referenced in this section, and sections VII and VIII, below.

 As utilized in this MOA, the term "average City cost of medical, dental and vision premiums" means the cost of premiums excluding resources from the Rate Stabilization Fund (hereinafter "Fund") and employee premium sharing, which shall be determined using the following calculation:

 For each program year of January 1, through December 31, after 2005, multiply the number of City employees covered by this MOA in each medical plan, as of June 30, of the applicable program year by the respective monthly medical plan premiums charged departments to determine the total monthly City medical premiums. Divide that total by the total number of employees covered by this MOA to determine the average monthly City medical premium. Conduct the same calculations for the dental and vision plans. Total the average monthly City medical, dental and vision plan premiums derived from these calculations and multiply by twelve to determine the average City cost, as referenced in this section, and sections VII and VIII, below.

 III REQUIRED CITY CONTRIBUTION

 For each program year of January 1, through December 31, after 2005, the City shall pay up to one hundred and seven percent (107%) of the average City cost of medical, dental and vision premiums for the previous January 1, through December 31, period towards the projected, increased premium costs of employee medical, dental and vision programs that have been approved by the Committee.

 If the total average plan cost for medical, dental and vision premiums for a program year of January 1, through December 31, after 2005, is projected by the Labor-Management Health Care Committee to exceed one hundred and seven percent (107%) of the average City cost of medical, dental and vision premiums paid by the City for the previous January 1, through December 31, program year, the matter shall be addressed as provided in section VII.

 If the total average plan cost for medical, dental and vision premiums for a program year is projected to be less than one hundred and seven percent (107%) of the average City cost of medical, dental and vision premiums paid by the City for the previous program year, the City shall only be obligated to pay that percentage increase in the average City cost of medical, dental and vision premiums paid by the City for the previous program year that is required to cover the projected increased total average plan cost for medical, dental and vision premiums.

 IV. RATE STABILAZATION FUND

 The Fund previously established by the parties shall be continued for utilization in year 2006 and beyond for the purposes described below. The initial funding shall be that level of funding that is contained within said previously existing Fund on the effective date of this MOA. The Fund shall also include money contributed on behalf of other Unions that may become a party to the MOA in the future, in addition to any interest, refunds, performance guarantee payments, excess premium revenues and other money that may become available or that is placed in the Fund as described in VIII, below. All such money shall be proportionately determined based upon the number of employees that are represented by the Unions that are a party to this MOA.

 V. LABOR-MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE

 The Committee shall continue as previously established by the parties. The Committee shall be composed of six (6) voting representatives identified annually by the Unions that are or become subject to this MOA, and six (6) voting representatives selected annually by the City. The Committee shall function as defined by the protocol and procedures previously established by the Committee or as hereinafter amended by the Committee.

 VI. COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES

 In addition to those specific responsibilities defined in sections VII and VIII, below, the Committee shall have responsibility for the following:

 a. Reviewing quarterly reports of fund activity for the Fund provided for in section IV, above.

 b. Reviewing medical, dental and vision claims activity and plan performance at each monthly meeting. The Committee can request preparation of special reports to monitor specific areas of concern or interest to the extent that the costs for such request(s) can be accommodated as part of the Personnel Department budget and/or the contract terms with consultants. The benefits consultant shall participate in these reviews on at least a quarterly basis.

 c. Determining benefit plan design. The Committee can request that research and study reports be prepared by staff and/or consultants to the extent that the costs for such request(s) can be accommodated as part of the Personnel Department budget and/or the contract terms with consultants, and may share employee feedback on benefit issues.

 d. Selection of health care plan providers and consultants, and participation in the Request for Proposal process when appropriate.

 e. Authorizing expenditures from the Fund to pay the cost for mailings to Union members, costs for special research and/or study reports referenced in b and c, above, that exceed the Personnel Department budget and/or the contract terms with consultants, and related costs associated with educational activities intended to positively impact plan cost.

 VII. DECISION-MAKING ASSOCIATED WITH COST PROJECTIONS

 If the total average plan cost of medical, dental and vision premiums for any program year (January 1 through December 31) after 2005 is projected to be greater than seven percent (7%) over the average City cost of medical, dental and vision premiums paid by the City for the prior program year (January 1, through December 31), then:

 a. The Committee must utilize existing Fund resources (including any special reserve resources pursuant VIII, below) applied to the total, annual premiums of the respective health care plan(s) to the extent necessary or until all the Fund is exhausted in an effort to remain within the projected total plan costs of medical, dental and vision premiums.

 b. If the Fund is exhausted, excess costs shall be addressed by the City paying eighty-five percent (85%) of the total excess costs, and employee premium sharing shall be increased in such a manner so that fifteen percent (15%) of the total excess costs are addressed.

 c. The respective health care plan benefit designs may only be modified by the agreement of the Committee.

 d. No decision by the Committee shall be permitted that modifies the percentages established in b, herein.

 VIII. DECISION-MAKING ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL EXPERIENCE

 Once the actual health care costs for a given program year have been determined, the Committee shall assess whether or not those costs exceeded premiums paid by the City, money utilized from the Fund, and premiums paid by employees.

 If the actual total plan costs of medical claims or premiums and dental and vision premiums were less than the premiums paid by the City, money utilized from the Fund, and premiums paid by employees, the positive balance shall be retained as a reserve in the Rate Stabilization Fund until the Committee makes projections for health care premium rates for the next program year to determine whether and/or to what extent all or a portion of this positive balance must be utilized as part of the decision-making process defined in VII, a, above. Once such projections are made, the Committee shall address the disposition of any remaining positive balance.

 If the actual total plan costs of medical claims or premiums and dental and vision premiums were more than the premiums paid by the City, money utilized from the Fund, and premiums paid by employees, the Committee shall determine the amount by which the premiums paid by the City, money utilized from the Fund, and premium shares paid by employees were exceeded. The Committee shall be required to address recovering the negative balance from the prior year through the decision-making process defined in VII, above, for cost projections for the next program year.

 IX. AMENDMENTS

 This MOA may be amended to the extent authorized by law upon agreement by the Committee or by the signatories.

 X. DEFINITION OF THE TERM "AGREEMENT"

 The definition of having reached an "agreement" as contemplated in sections VI, VII, VIII, and IX, above, shall mean that at least four (4) of the Labor members and four (4) of the City members of the Committee concur with the decision in question.

 XI. TERM OF AGREEMENT

 This MOA shall be valid for two (2) years from January 1, 2006, and shall renew itself for a three-year period on each third-year anniversary of said date. Provided, however, the City or a Union which is a party to this MOA may give notice not more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to a third-year anniversary date of their intent to amend this MOA through the collective bargaining process or withdraw as a party to which the terms of this MOA are applicable . In the latter case, the MOA shall remain in full force and effect for all Unions which remain a party to it and the City, if the City has not withdrawn.

 Signed this ________ day of June, 2005.
