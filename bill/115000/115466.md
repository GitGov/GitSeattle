 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; postponing implementation of certain wastewater treatment rate calculations, and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.28.040 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Section 21.28.040.B defines the wastewater volume rate to be the sum of the treatment rate, system rate, and Master Metered Residential Development ("MMRD") surcharge; and

 WHEREAS, the system rate effective January 1, 2006, the treatment rate effective January 1, 2005 and the MMRD surcharge, all as set forth in SMC Section 21.28.040.B, all are sufficient to meet the financial needs of the wastewater system for 2006 because King County is not raising the treatment cost that Seattle will be charged in 2006; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.28.040 Subsection B.1 is amended to read as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal services provided by King County ("treatment cost"). Effective January 1, 2004, the treatment rate shall be $4.22 per CCF. Effective January 1, 2005, the treatment rate shall be $4.72 per CCF. For rates effective January 1, 2007 and thereafter, Seattle Public Utilities shall calculate annually a new treatment rate. The new treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected treatment cost is divided by the projected billed wastewater consumption, each for the next calendar year and each as specified in the most recent ordinance passed by City Council for the purpose of calculating the new treatment rate, and (b) the result is multiplied by one hundred and sixteen and one-half percent (116.5%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which projected treatment cost may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the total treatment cost expected to be paid by Seattle Public Utilities in the current year and the total wastewater volume charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. Each new treatment rate calculated in accordance with this Subsection B.1 shall be effective on each January 1, commencing January 1, ~~2006~~2007, unless otherwise directed by City Council in the most recent treatment rate ordinance.

 Section 2. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2005.
