 AN ORDINANCE implementing a court order regarding the City Light Department's funding of the City's One Percent for Art program; appropriating funds to Finance General to reimburse the Light Fund for expenditures on certain public art projects; transferring jurisdiction of certain art projects from the City Light Department to the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs; and appropriating funds to the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs to refund certain moneys contributed by the City Light Department to the Municipal Arts Fund; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, in Okeson v. Seattle, the Washington State Court of Appeals on December 19, 2005 upheld the City's One Percent for Art ordinance as applied to the City Light Department ("City Light"), but also held that art funded by City Light must have a sufficiently close nexus to the utility's fundamental purpose of providing electricity to its ratepayers; and

 WHEREAS, a Stipulation and Order was filed in Superior Court on March 15, 2006 implementing the Court of Appeals' ruling (the "Order," attached hereto as Attachment 1); and

 WHEREAS, the Order requires the City to reimburse the Light Fund, plus interest, for utility moneys spent on art projects deemed impermissible by the court (identified in Exhibit A of the Order), and to transfer jurisdiction over those art projects to another City department; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs is another City department and especially well-equipped to accept jurisdiction of the challenged art projects on behalf of the general government of the City; and
