 EASEMENT

 The Grantor, CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation ("City"), hereby grants, conveys and quitclaims to THE BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY ("BNSF Railway Company"), a Delaware corporation, for the following purposes, a non-exclusive easement over and across the real property described in Exhibit A ("Property") in King County, Washington.

 This Easement is subject to the following terms and conditions:

 1. Purpose. BNSF Railway Company may use the Property for the installation, operation, and maintenance of a railroad spur track. The City must give prior written approval for the design and construction (including scheduling), relating to the spur track to occur on the Property, which approval shall not be unreasonably, withheld, delayed, or conditioned. The City must also give prior written approval for all other additional uses or improvements to be built on the Property, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. BNSF Railway Company will not allow the use of the tracks for storage of rail cars for longer than four hours, except in an emergency.

 2. The City's and Port of Seattle's Use of Easement. The City, on behalf of itself and the Port of Seattle, reserves the right to use the Property for any purpose not inconsistent with installation, operation and maintenance of a railroad spur track. The City and the Port of Seattle, in addition to this general reservation, have the right to construct and allow the use of roads or other transportation corridors and utilities across the Property, in uses not inconsistent with this Easement. The City will exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to rail spur operations during such activity and use. Responsibilities of both parties are further defined in the Construction and Maintenance Agreement, Construction of the E. Marginal Way Crossing (Sig Tail TRK).

 3. Environmental Liability. In the event BNSF Railway Company or any other assignee is named as a defendant in a suit or other claim or proceeding alleging injury, damages or loss from pre-existing Hazardous Substances on the Property, the City will defend, indemnify, and hold BNSF Railway Company and any other assignee, harmless from all liability arising out of such claims to the extent these liabilities are the result of pre-existing Hazardous Substances, provided that the City's obligation to defend shall not include any costs of separate counsel or other legal or technical assistance retained by the City. "Hazardous Substances" means any substance or material defined or designated as a hazardous waste, toxic substance, or other pollutant or contaminant, by any environmentally related local, state or federal law, regulation, ordinance or order (including without limitation any final order of any court of competent jurisdiction), now or hereafter in effect.

 4. Indemnity. The City, its employees, and agents shall not be liable for any injury (including death) to any persons or for damage to any property, sustained or alleged to have been sustained by BNSF Railway Company or by others, including but not limited to all persons directly or indirectly employed by BNSF Railway Company, or any agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees, assignees or invitees of BNSF Railway Company, as a result of any condition (including existing or future defects in the Property), or occurrence (including failure or interruption of utility service) whatsoever related in any way to the Property and the areas adjacent thereto, or related in any way to BNSF Railway Company's or any agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees, assignees or invitees of BNSF Railway Company's use or occupancy of the Property and areas adjacent thereto. To the extent of BNSF Railway Company's negligence, BNSF Railway Company agrees to defend and to hold and save the City harmless from all liability or expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs, and all expenses of litigation) in connection with any such items of actual or alleged injury or damage, except when such injury or damage is caused by the negligence of the City.

 5. Abandonment. The rights, titles, privileges and authority granted under this Easement will continue and be in force until such time as BNSF Railway Company, its successors or assigns, ceases to use the Property for the prescribed uses for a period of twelve (12) months, at which time all such rights, title, privileges and authority granted shall terminate and revert to the Port. The City will issue a notice to BNSF Railway Company indicating that the twelve month period has passed and BNSF Railway Company or the user of the rail track must provide evidence to the City within thirty (30) days that rail activity has occurred within the appropriate twelve month period. Failure to respond within the 30-day period will be deemed an admission that there has been no activity during the 12-month period.

 6. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the parties shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon their respective successors and assigns. BNSF Railway Company may not assign this Easement to any third party other than its joint operating partners without the City's prior written consent.

 7. No Conveyance of Fee. The parties expressly agree that there is no intent to convey any other rights except those that are granted in this Easement. The parties do not intend for this Easement to convey fee title in any form or any other interest other than a non-exclusive easement.

 8. Relocation of the Rail Spur. The parties acknowledge that the Port of Seattle (Port) may develop Port-owned property in the future. In order to maintain its development options, the parties recognize and agree that the Port, in its grant of an easement to the City, has reserved the right to relocate the rail spur, subject to the conditions contained in the Easement dated May 14, 2004, from the Port to the City.

 Further, the parties hereto agree:

 A. The City will, following five years prior written notice from the Port, relocate the rail spur on Port land at Terminal 46 or onto land not owned by the Port. If the new location is on Port land at Terminal 46, the location must be acceptable to the Port and BNSF Railway Company. In no event will the Port nor any other assignee, including BNSF Railway Company, bear any cost or liability for this relocation.

 B. If the Port gives less than five years prior written notice of relocation, and the relocation will be on Port-owned land at Terminal 46, the Port will undertake the relocation. In no event will the City nor any other assignee, including BNSF Railway Company bear any cost for this relocation.

 C. The Port City agrees that, at any time, if the rail spur is relocated on Port-owned property or non-Port-owned property, the location will be on the premises of Terminal 46, and that the relocated spur will provide equivalent service as the initial rail spur to be built by the City under ;this Easement. The parties agree to execute a new easement for the new location, and include all the rights and conditions described in this easement to the new rail spur location on Port property.
