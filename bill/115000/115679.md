Owner also submitted a concurrent application to subdivide the Property into the 14 lots.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

Single family units shall be located toward the exterior of the site adjacent to public rights-of-way and multifamily units shall be located toward the interior of the site.

 b. Single family units shall be made available at prices affordable to households earning no more than eighty (80) percent of the area median income, as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.84.025. Multifamily units shall be made available at rents affordable to households earning no more than fifty (50) percent of the area median income, as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.84.025.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owners and the City; provided, such amendment shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the SF 5000 zone.
