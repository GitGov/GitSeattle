 ARTICLE 1. NONDISCRIMINATION

 1.1 The City and the Department will not discriminate against any employee by reason of race, color, age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, creed, religion, ancestry or national origin, Union activities, or presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap.

 1.2 Whenever words denoting gender are used in this Agreement, they are intended to apply equally to either gender.

 The use of plural pronouns in this Agreement to avoid gender connotation is not intended to make any provision inapplicable to an individual.

 In deleting "Gender Based" nomenclature from this contract, both parties agree that there is no intent to change meaning or to alter any relation to applicable city, state and federal laws, regulations and standards or to industry standards. Where "Gender Based" nomenclature occurs in such documents it shall be interpreted to apply to any substitute term used in this contract. Prior contracts shall be used to resolve doubts.

 ARTICLE 2. SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT

 2.1 This Agreement is applicable to employees of the Department as noted in the Classifications of Schedule "A", who have designated as their representative Local Union Number 77, IBEW, signatory to this Agreement.

 2.1.1 Those duties performed by employees represented by the Union at Seattle City Light on January 22, 1991 shall remain in the jurisdiction of the Union. If those duties are assigned to a different or new classification in the classified service due to amendments resulting from future automation and technologies, the Union will continue to be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative for those duties. Any disagreement between the parties over the application of this Section shall be processed and resolved pursuant to RCW 41.56. WAC 391.35.

 2.4 The Union may grieve contracting out of work as described in Article 2, if such contract involves work normally performed by the employees covered by this Agreement, and provided that such contract is the cause of the layoff of employees covered by this Agreement.

 2.5 If the City of Seattle were to sell or otherwise transfer, per RCW 35.94.020, the functions of the City Light Department performed by the Bargaining Unit to another entity, such as a private sector company or a newly formed or existing public utility district, hereinafter referred to as the successor employer, the City will include as part of the agreement for sale or transfer a requirement that the entity shall continue to provide electrical services on a reliable basis during and after the transfer.

 2.5.4 The Union recognizes the City and Department cannot be held accountable or liable for the actions or inactions of the successor employer provided the terms of this Section 2.5 have been complied with and no misrepresentations have been made to the successor regarding the spirit and intent of this successor clause.

 2.6 Reorganization/Merger with another City Department: The City agrees that should it place the electric utility Bargaining Unit work within the scope of this Agreement and/or the employees performing the Bargaining Unit work in another City Department during the term of this Agreement, IBEW, Local 77 will continue to be recognized as representing this Bargaining Unit work per the provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement; provided that the merger/reorganization and this Section 2.6 do not violate a statutory requirement of representation.

 ARTICLE 7. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

 7.1 Recognizing that the terms of the Agreement may be subject to different interpretations, both the Department and the Union should have recourse to an orderly means of resolving grievances. The following outline of procedure by which grievances shall be processed is written as for a grievance of the Union against the Department, but it is understood that the steps are similar for a grievance of the Department against the Union.

 A grievance is defined as any dispute between the parties and/or any employee concerning the interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of the terms and conditions addressed in this Agreement.

 Step 1: As the initial step, the grievance shall be verbally presented by the Union Steward to the employee's immediate supervisor (who is outside of the Bargaining Unit) within fifteen (15) working days of the Steward's knowledge that a grievable incident has allegedly occurred.

 Step 2: If no settlement is arrived at in Step 1, the grievance may be referred in writing by the employee or the Steward to the Business Manager of the Union. If the Business Manager decides that the grievance should be forwarded to the Department Human Resources Officer (or designee), he shall submit it in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations, within fifteen (15) working days after the discussion in Step 1. The grievance should set forth the following:

 a. A statement of the nature of the grievance and the facts upon which it is based.

 b. The remedy or correction desired.

 c. The Section or Sections of the Agreement relied upon as being applicable thereto. When a grievance is so presented, the Department and Union shall, within ten (10) working days schedule a meeting to discuss the grievance. The Department shall reply in writing within fifteen (15) working days from the date of the meeting. Should the parties agree to forego such a meeting, the Department shall, within fifteen (15) working days from the grievance being so presented,

 investigate and reply to the Union in writing.

 Step 3: If no settlement is arrived at in Step 2, the grievance shall be submitted in writing within fifteen (15) working days after the Step 2 answer, to a Joint Labor/Management Committee composed of three (3) representatives of the Union and three (3) representatives for the Department, one of whom shall be the City Director of Labor Relations (or designee), who shall endeavor to settle the grievance within fifteen (15) working days.

 Step 4: If the difference or complaint is not settled in Step 3, it may be referred to the American Arbitration Association for arbitration to be conducted under its voluntary labor arbitration regulations. Such reference to arbitration will be made within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Step 3 response, and will be accompanied by the following information:

 1. Question or questions at issue.

 2. Statement of facts.

 3. Position of employee or employees.

 4. Remedy sought.

 The parties agree to abide by the award made in connection with any arbitral difference. There will be no suspension of work, slow down or curtailment of services while any difference is in process of adjustment or arbitration.

 a. In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood as follows:

 1. The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from or alter, change or modify the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitrator's power shall be limited to interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement, and all other matters shall be excluded from arbitration.

 2. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Department, the Union, and the employee(s) involved.

 3. The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Department and the Union, and each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case.

 4. The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and shall be issued to the parties within thirty (30) days after the case is submitted to the arbitrator.

 5. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the Department and Union from settling by mutual agreement, prior to final award, any grievance submitted to arbitration herein.

 7.1.1 By mutual agreement, the parties to this Agreement, the Union and the City, may: 1) submit the grievance for mediation prior to arbitration under the City's mediation model; or 2) may request the arbitrator selected for arbitration, or another arbitrator, mediate the dispute which shall then be subject to arbitration by a different Arbitrator if mediation should fail to result in a settlement.

 7.1.2 Grievances processed through Step 3 shall be heard during normal City working hours (7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.) at the Department's Human Resources Office Headquarters or Union Office unless the parties agree a satellite location is more appropriate. Employees involved in such grievance meetings during their working hours shall be allowed to do so without suffering a loss in pay. No more than one (1) Shop Steward and the grievant shall attend the grievance meeting, except through prior approval of the Department.

 7.2 Any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for the stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing.

 7.3 When a grievance is of a general nature, it will not be necessary that the Union list the names of the aggrieved employees.

 7.4 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be retroactive beyond the date of occurrence or non-occurrence upon which the grievance is based.

 ARTICLE 8. DISCIPLINE

 8.1 The City/Department may suspend, demote or discharge an employee for just cause.

 8.2 The parties agree that in their respective roles primary emphasis shall be placed on preventing situations requiring disciplinary actions through effective employee-management relations. The primary objective of discipline shall be to correct and rehabilitate, not to punish or penalize. To this end, in order of increasing severity, the disciplinary actions which the City/Department may take against an employee include:

 a. verbal warning b. written reprimand c. suspension d. demotion e. termination

 Which disciplinary action is taken depends upon the seriousness of the affected employee's conduct.

 8.3 In cases of suspension, demotion or discharge, the specified charges shall be furnished to the Union and the employee in writing.

 8.4 The Union/employee covered by this Agreement must, upon initiating an appeal relating to disciplinary action, use either the grievance procedure contained herein or pertinent procedures regarding disciplinary appeals to the Civil Service Commission. Under no circumstances may the Union/employee use both the contract grievance procedure and Civil Service Commission procedures relative to the same disciplinary action.

 ARTICLE 9. WORK STOPPAGE

 9.1 The public interest in the accomplishment of the purposes of the Department always being paramount, the Department and the Union further agree that, pending the determination or adjustment of any issue arising between them, there will be no change in the conditions in any schedules or recorded understanding applicable to such issue. There will be no stoppage or interference with the progress of the work during the term of this Agreement.

 ARTICLE 10. HOLIDAYS

 10.1 The following days shall be recognized as paid holidays:

 10.2 An employee must be on pay status on the regularly scheduled workday immediately preceding or immediately following a holiday to be entitled to holiday pay and new employees and employees returning from non-pay leave starting work the day after a holiday shall not be entitled to pay for the holiday preceding their first day of work;

 provided, that short authorized absences of not to exceed four (4) days' duration shall not be considered in the application of the preceding portion of this subsection, and provided further, that no combination of circumstances whereby two (2) holidays are affected by the foregoing proviso may result in payment for more than one (1) of such holidays. Employees who work less than a full calendar year shall be entitled only to those holidays, Monday to Friday inclusive, which fall within their work period. Employees quitting work or discharged for cause shall not be entitled to pay for holidays following their last day of work.

 10.3 Holidays falling on Saturday or Sunday shall be recognized and paid on those actual days for employees regularly scheduled to work those days. Payment will be made only once for any holiday.

New employees employed on or before October 1 of a calendar year shall be entitled to use the Second Floating Holiday during the calendar year.

 10.5 It is the intent of the Department, the City and the Union that employees be treated equitably and nonarbitrarily in their ability to schedule floating holidays on the date of their choice.

 ARTICLE 11. VACATIONS

 11.1 Annual vacations with pay shall be granted to eligible employees computed at the rate shown in Section 11.3 for each hour on regular pay status as shown on the payroll.

 11.4 An employee who is eligible for vacation benefits shall accrue vacation from the date of entering City service or the date upon which he/she became eligible and may accumulate a vacation balance which shall never exceed at any time two (2) times the number of annual vacation hours for which the employee is currently eligible. Accrual and accumulation of vacation time shall cease at the time an employee's vacation balance reaches the maximum balance allowed and shall not resume until the employee's vacation balance is below the maximum allowed; provided, however, any employee whose vacation balance on January 1, 1994 exceeds the maximum allowed may retain the excess balance and accrue additional vacation at the appropriate rate through January 1, 1996, after which date all vacation hours in excess of the maximum vacation balance allowed for in Section 11.3 and 11.4 shall be lost, and further accrual and the maximum vacation balance shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Article without benefit of the 1993 grace period proviso.

 11.5 New employees may, with department approval, use accumulated vacation with pay after completing one thousand forty (1040) hours on regular pay status.

 11.6 An employee may, upon approval of the appropriate Management representative, exceed the maximum vacation allowance by no more than twenty (20) days when the employee has been prevented from using said vacation time by reason of injury, illness or department work schedules. The employee shall have one (1) year to use the special extension and will be allowed to continue to accrue vacation during this period.

 11.7 "Service year" is defined as the period of time between an employee's date of hire and the one-year anniversary date of the employee's date of hire or the period of time between any two (2) consecutive anniversaries of the employee's date of hire thereafter.

 11.8 The minimum vacation allowance to be taken by an employee shall be four (4) hours or, at the discretion of the appropriate management representative, such lesser fraction of a day as shall be approved by the appropriate management representative.

 11.9 An employee who leaves the City service for any reason after more than six (6) months of service shall be paid in a lump sum for any unused vacation he/she has previously accrued.

 11.9.1 Upon the death of an employee in active service, pay shall be allowed for any vacation earned in the preceding year and in the current year and not taken prior to the death of such employee.

 11.10 Where an employee has exhausted his/her sick leave balance, the employee may use vacation for further leave for medical reasons. In all other instances, employees must use all accrued vacation prior to beginning a leave of absence, except that employees who are called to active military service or who respond to requests for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may, at their option, use accrued vacation in conjunction with a leave of absence.

 Where the terms of this Section 11.10 are in conflict with Ordinance 116761 (family and medical leave) as it exists or may be hereafter modified, the ordinance shall apply.

 11.11 The appropriate Management representative shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as will least interfere with the functions of the department but which accommodate the desires of the employee to the greatest degree feasible.

 11.12 Employees with prior regular City service who are regularly appointed to positions within the City shall begin accruing vacation at the rate which was applicable upon their most recent separation from regular City service.

Employees who remained on the system as outlined in the 1991-1994 Collective Bargaining Agreement may convert to the new system in September of each succeeding year. These subsequently converting employees shall receive a two (2) year transition period in which to use excess hours as outlined in 11.4.

 11.14 For purposes of establishing the vacation accrual rate for employees who are in the Bargaining Unit on the date of ratification, the City will assign the date January 1 of the year the employee joined City service as the Anniversary date and begin calculating hours on regular pay status from that date. This assignment will prevent a loss of accrual which would result from the conversion of the vacation system.

 11.15 New employees joining City service after the date of ratification shall be immediately placed on hourly vacation accrual with an Anniversary date of the first day of actual service.

 payment to employees who would otherwise be entitled thereto.

 15.4 If work to be done on any specified job shall require a longer period than ten (10) workdays, such work may be organized on a shift basis. In that case, employees will be paid at the regular straight time wage for any eight (8) hour shift; and working conditions governing regular working hours shall prevail for any eight (8) hour shift.

 ARTICLE 17. WAGE RATES

 17.1 The Department agrees to pay to its employees, and the Union agrees that its members employed by the Department will accept, the wage scales for the various classifications set forth and contained in Schedule "A" of this Agreement.

 17.1.1 The base wage rates effective on January 23, 2006, shall be computed to reflect a percentage increase equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton area Consumer Price Index for June 2005 over the same index for June 2004; provided, however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%). The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84 = 100), covering the period June 2004 - June 2005 as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth (10th) of a percent. The base wage rates effective on January 23, 2006 as set forth in Schedule "A" of this Agreement, for this year only, reflect a percentage increase of three point eight percent (3.8%), which is the cost of living adjustment plus one point five percent (1.5%) above the rates in effect on January 22, 2006.

 17.1.2 The base wage rates effective on January 23, 2007, shall be computed to reflect a percentage increase equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton area Consumer Price Index for June 2006 over the same index for June 2005; provided, however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%). The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84 = 100), covering the period June 2005 - June 2006 as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth (10th) of a percent.

 17.1.3 The base wage rates effective on January 23, 2008, shall be computed to reflect a percentage increase equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton area Consumer Price Index for June 2007 over the same index for June 2006; provided, however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%). The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84=100), covering the period June 2006 - June 2007 as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth (10th) of a percent.

 17.1.4 In the event the "Consumer Price Index" becomes unavailable for purposes of computing any one of the afore-referenced increases, the parties shall jointly request the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide a comparable index for purposes of computing such increase and if that is not satisfactory, the parties shall promptly undertake negotiations solely with respect to agreeing upon a substitute formula for determining a comparable adjustment.

 17.2 Every employee upon first appointment or assignment shall receive not less than minimum rate of the salary range fixed for the position.

 17.2.1 Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or applicable Standards of Apprentices, an employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range. Actual service for purposes of this Section shall be defined in terms of one (1) month's service for each month of full-time employment, including paid absences.

 17.2.2 For employees assigned salary steps other than the beginning step of the salary range, subsequent salary increases within the salary range shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the appointment or increase, then at succeeding twelve (12) month intervals to the maximum of the salary range established for the class.

 17.2.3 In determining "actual service" for advancement in salary step, absence due to sickness or injury for which the employee does not receive compensation may at the discretion of the City be credited at the rate of thirty (30) calendar days per year. Unpaid absences due to other causes may, at the discretion of the City, be credited at the rate of fifteen (15) calendar days per year. For the purposes of this paragraph, time lost by reason of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or Charter disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff, or who is reduced in rank to a position in the same or another department, may be given credit for such prior service.

 17.2.4 Any increase in salary based on service shall become effective upon the first day immediately following completion of the applicable period of service.

 17.2.5 An employee transferred to another position in the same class or having an identical salary range shall continue to be compensated at the same rate of pay until the combined service requirement is fulfilled for a step increase, and shall thereafter receive step increases as provided in Section 17.2.1 of this Article.

 17.3 As a matter of general personnel administration, employees can be expected to assume responsibilities and perform duties within their craft above or below their classifications, in a relief

 capacity or for a portion of their time, except where contrary to current practices.

 17.4 Effective January 23, 2006 shift differential pay will be three dollars and twenty five cents ($3.25) per hour added to the base rate. An employee who is regularly scheduled to work shifts other than regular dayshift hours (first shift), unless agreed otherwise between the parties, shall receive shift differential for all hours worked.

 17.4.1 Employees on vacation, sick leave, industrial injury and light duty (day shift) shall not receive shift differential. It is understood that shift differential stays with the shift and not with the individual.

 17.4.2 Shift extensions before and after the regular work shift other than day crews (first shift) will be paid at the double (2) time rate of pay plus the shift differential.

 17.4.3 All hours worked on shift work relief for vacation, sick leave, industrial injury, leave of absence, training, out-of-class

 assignments, and/or special assignment will be paid at the double (2) time rate of pay plus the shift differential.

 17.4.4 Employees working a twelve (12) hour dayshift will receive the shift differential for the last four (4) hours of the shift.

 17.4.5 Shift differential will be paid for all shift hours worked in accordance with Section 15.4.

 17.4.6 All other overtime, whether scheduled or by callout, will be paid at the double (2) time rate of pay only.

 17.4.7 This shift differential pay is included as compensation on which retirement system contributions are calculated and made by the employee and by the City, except in overtime situations.

 17.4.8 Shift personnel will have access to safety meetings, training opportunities and Union representation.

 ARTICLE 18. SUBSISTENCE

 18.1 When employees are required by the Department to travel more than thirty (30) miles from their normal headquarters (except to Bothell Substation or Cedar Falls for employees normally headquartered within the Seattle area) they shall receive a meal allowance at the Federal Per Diem rate. When overnight lodging away from the employee's home is required, it shall be reimbursed up to the Runzheimer rate.

 ARTICLE 24. UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION

 24.1 When and if members of IBEW, Local 77 covered by an agreement between themselves and the City of Seattle, City Light Department cease to be covered by the Federal and State law requiring City of Seattle, City Light Department participation in an unemployment compensation program, the City of Seattle, City Light Department, will implement a self-insured form of unemployment compensation for employees covered by this Agreement.

 The unemployment compensation will meet the following criteria:

 24.1.1 Provide coverage for full-time employees who have completed one (1) continuous year of service with the City immediately preceding such layoff; provided, however, an employee who is on authorized leave of absence during the year immediately prior to layoff shall be deemed in continuous employment immediately preceding such layoff for purposes of eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits as provided herein, but such leave time when taken without pay shall not be included in the computation of the one (1) year requirement.

 24.1.2 Coverage will only apply to those employees who are laid off.

 24.1.3 Employees who are receiving compensation under this program must provide evidence of actively seeking employment.

 24.1.4 The weekly benefit will be the same as the State of Washington Unemployment Compensation Program, but shall be good for twenty-six (26) weeks only (no extended benefits).

 24.1.5 When and if the City of Seattle is required by Federal or State law to participate in any unemployment compensation program or finance unemployment compensation benefits, the City of Seattle's obligation to any employee under Section 24.1 will cease as long as the weekly benefit amount under said Federal or State law is equivalent to or exceeds the weekly benefit amount specified under Section 24.1. If the weekly benefit received under the Federal or State mandated program is less than that provided under Section 24.1, the City of Seattle shall supplement the payments made pursuant to Federal or State law to the extent that the unemployment compensation weekly benefit would equal that provided under Section 24.1.

 24.1.6 Under no circumstances shall an employee be entitled to the City of Seattle unemployment compensation benefit while drawing a similar benefit from another source.

 ARTICLE 25. BULLETIN BOARDS

 25.1 Bulletin boards shall be maintained at all permanent headquarters and shall be available to the signatory Union for posting of official Union bulletins.

 ARTICLE 26. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS

 26.1 All employees who are required to use their own transportation on Department business shall be reimbursed at a rate

 to reflect the United States Internal Revenue Service cents per mile rate as announced in that year, or immediately prior thereto, for purposes of United States Income Tax deductions for use of a privately owned automobile for business purposes.

 26.2 No wage rate, reasonable condition or privilege not inconsistent with this Agreement presently enjoyed by any classification of employees covered by this Agreement shall be reduced because of the signing of this Agreement.

 26.3 Employees relieved from duty except for cause during the first half of the day or shift shall receive not less than one-half (1/2) day's pay; if relieved from duty except for cause after having been on duty more than one-half (1/2) day, they shall receive a full

 day's pay, unless relieved at their own request.

 26.4 The Union signatory to this Agreement shall have the option or privilege of payroll deductions for Union dues in compliance with Department regulations.

 26.5 Industrial Injury or Illness: In August of 1991, the City Council enacted an ordinance revising this benefit. The provisions are reflected in the following language which replaces language which became null and void per the 1991-94 Agreement.

 Any employee who is disabled in the discharge of his/her duties and if such disablement results in absence from his/her regular duties, shall be compensated, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed two hundred sixty-one (261) regularly scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly scheduled workday after the day of the on-the-job injury; provided the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts.

 26.5.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on no pay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized that results in absence from his/her regular duties (up to a maximum of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay per day) shall be reinstated by industrial insurance or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 26.5.

 26.5.2 Such compensation shall be authorized by the Personnel Director or his/her designee with the advice of such employee's department head on request from the employee supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under Seattle Municipal Code 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 26.5.3 Compensation for holidays and earned vacation falling within a period of absence due to such disability shall be at the normal rate of pay but such days shall not be considered as regularly scheduled workdays as applied to the time limitations set forth within Section 26.5. Disabled employees affected by the provisions of SMC 4.44 shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though actively employed during the period set forth within Sections 26.5 and 26.5.1.

 26.5.4 Any employee eligible for the benefits provided by SMC 4.44 whose disability prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties but in the judgment of his/her physician could perform duties of a less strenuous nature, shall be employed at his/her normal rate of pay in such other suitable duties as the department head shall direct, with the approval of such employee's physician until the Personnel Director requests closure of such employee's claim pursuant to SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 26.5.5 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 26.5.1.

 26.5.6 The afore-referenced disability compensation shall be understood to be in lieu of State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid.

 26.5.7 Appeals of any denials under this Article shall be made through the Department of Labor and Industries as prescribed in Title 51 R.C.W.

 26.6 A qualified City Light Journeyworker shall review at appropriate intervals during construction and prior to energization, electrical portions of all underground, all overhead, and all station projects undertaken by contractors for the Department within the City Light service area. Underground work shall be reviewed by a Journeyworker Cable Splicer, overhead work shall be reviewed by a Journeyworker Lineworker, and station work shall be reviewed by a Journeyworker Electrician Constructor. Direct burial facilities installed by contract may be reviewed by any of the Journeyworker classifications as covered by Section 31.17.

 The Journeyworker selected to review the contractor's job shall become familiar with the electrical system to insure that no undue hazard exists so far as future maintenance is concerned. The Journeyworker shall have the responsibility and authority to point out and/or report any condition or situation that would render the job unsafe. A copy of these reports shall be turned in to the Supervisor of the appropriate Division. Should it be necessary to leave a job in a temporary or unsafe condition for a short period of time, the Department shall post a report of such condition on the safety bulletin boards in the appropriate Division.

 The Department agrees that conditions which are documented as unsafe will be corrected before work is accepted for regular operation and maintenance.

 A copy of the City Light Inspection Division's authorization to energize shall include the name of the Journeyworker who reviewed the construction and shall be furnished to the Supervisor of the appropriate Division and the Power Dispatcher. In order to review the contractor's job, the Journeyworker selected may be required to work the same hours as the contractor's employees and shall not be paid overtime except when working more than an eight-hour day. As used in this Section, the term "Journeyworker" shall also include the appropriate Crew Chief.

 26.7 Electrical Trades Trainees shall be included in the Bargaining Unit. It is understood and agreed that the Electrical Trades Trainee position is a training position in which the Electrical Trades Trainee is trained in all phases of an Electrical Helper's job. The concept is that under direction and guidance, the Electrical Trades Trainee will perform tasks as needed to learn the safest, best and most efficient method to do an Electrical Helper's job. The job site portion of this learning process will be under the direct guidance of a regular helper with participation by the Journeyworker and/or Crew Chief.

 It is further understood that the Electrical Trades Trainee will in no way replace or substitute for a regular Helper.

 ARTICLE 27. SAVINGS CLAUSE

 27.1 Should any part hereof or any provision herein contained be rendered or declared invalid by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation, or by any decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidation of such part or portion of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remaining portions thereof; provided, however, upon such invalidation that parties agree immediately to meet and negotiate such parts or provisions affected. The remaining parts or provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 ARTICLE 28. GENERAL WORKING RULES

 28.1 The Working Rules contained herein, and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, are hereby adopted, and will remain in effect until modified or amended. Any changes in the Working Rules between the Department and the local Union signatory hereto shall be promulgated in the form of schedules supplementary to and incorporated in this Agreement.

 28.2 Employees shall receive an amount not less than the equal of four (4) hours of straight-time pay each time called out from their homes at times other than regular working hours. They shall be paid the regular overtime rates from the time they leave home until they return to their homes, except no pay shall be allowed while eating or sleeping; provided, however, that if employees are notified before

 leaving their regular daily work to report for duty after regular working hours, they shall be paid only from the time they report to headquarters until the time of their return to headquarters, but in any event not less than the equal of four (4) hours of straight-time pay.

 28.2.1 Employees will be paid car mileage as covered in Section 26.1 if they are required to furnish their transportation to and from their homes on a callout as described in Section 28.2. No mileage payment will be made if the employees are notified before leaving their regular daily work to report for duty after regular working hours.

 28.3 Employees on overtime pay before the start of their regular shift, who have enough of such overtime to equal eight (8) hours or more of regular time rate of pay, shall have eight (8) consecutive hours of relief before being returned to regular straight-time rate of pay, and such employees may be relieved from duty for the day after having earned at least ten (10) hours' straight-time pay. The employees/crew may choose to work one-half of their next regular shift at the overtime rate of pay. After the involved employees have realized compensation equal to their regular shift pay, their supervisor may release them from duty for the remainder of their shift. Alternatively, the employees may at their option use sick leave to compensate for the required time off from their regular scheduled shifts.

 28.4 Employees called for duty less than four (4) hours before beginning of regular working hours, or their shift hours, shall be paid at the rate of double time (except intermission for meals) from the time they are called until the beginning of their regular working hours or shift hours. Regular hours or shift hours following shall be at straight time.

 28.5 Where the Department desires the transfer of employees from one shift to another, no loss in regular pay shall result and a

 nominal sixteen (16) hours off duty between shifts shall be allowed and the overtime rate shall be paid for all the time less than the nominal sixteen (16) hours off duty, except where otherwise agreed upon by the Department and the Union.

 28.5.1 The schedule for the days to work and the days off go with the job and not the employee, and an employee exercising the option for the change from one job to another assumes the days of work and days off of the new job, and anything pertaining to the schedule for the old job ceases at the beginning of the new job.

 28.5.2 Nothing in this Section shall be construed to avoid the payment of overtime to an upgraded employee called back from scheduled time off to fill a higher position when the regular employee in that position is absent from work.

 28.6 When employees are transferred to any position in which they have had no previous experience, they shall be given a reasonable break-in period with an experienced employee in that position.

 28.7 All employees working on poles, towers, or suspension type platforms seventy-five (75) feet above ground or higher shall receive additional compensation while actually working at these heights. This additional compensation shall be at the straight time rate in addition to the normal rate in effect at the time the work is being performed. This rule shall not apply when employees are working on roofs of buildings where no exceptional hazard exists, nor does it apply to Lineworker (Testing Live Line Insulators over 7500 volts).

 28.8 Employees shall not be required to report before or after their regular work periods to other than their regular headquarters for the purpose of picking up vehicles or materials.

 28.9 Employees required to attend meetings called by the Department outside of regular working hours shall be paid overtime for those hours which are worked in addition to their regular shift. When attendance at departmental meetings cannot reasonably be scheduled during an employee's regular shift, such employee can be expected to attend as scheduled. An employee who has compelling reasons which make it unreasonable for the employee to attend a given meeting outside of the employee's regular shift shall discuss the

 situation with the supervisor as far in advance as possible so that alternate arrangements can be made. An employee's attendance at such meetings shall be scheduled at least seven (7) days in advance.

 28.10 When a job to be done has been given to an individual or crew and, after inspecting or attempting to do the job, it has been turned back unfinished, the reason for turning it back must be put in writing by the person so doing. Special note must be made of extraordinary hazards, and this information must be given to all persons or crews that are later requested to do the same job.

All changes of headquarters for any work unit (bid position) shall first be reviewed by the Joint Labor Management Committee for compliance with this Article.

 28.12.1 All employees shall be assigned to a headquarters which meets the definition of 28.12. Thereafter, they shall report to that place as their "normal work headquarters" at the beginning of the workday and shall be regarded as on duty. Travel from headquarters to job locations and back to headquarters shall be part of the employee's work time, and any transportation necessary shall be provided by the Department. Instead of reporting to their headquarters, employees may be directed to begin their regular work shift at a department designated location within the distribution area for training. Parking costs, supported by a receipt, shall be

 reimbursed by the Department.

 28.12.2 If the City Light Department undertakes a project within the distribution area which will occupy one (1) or more employees for a period of more than ten (10) days, one (1) or more employees may be required to report at the headquarters nearest the work project for the duration of the project. The employee shall (except for breakdown or emergency) receive at least five (5) workdays advance notice of a shift in a headquarters as covered in this paragraph. Upon completion of the project, the employees shall return to their "normal work headquarters." These headquarters shall meet the requirements of Section 28.12.

 c. The normal work week for those crews traveling may need to conform to the schedules at work locations they may be temporarily assigned to.

 d. An employee regularly assigned to the Seattle distribution area shall not be assigned to work at any headquarters outside that area for more than thirty (30) working days out of any ninety (90) working days.

 e. Except for unanticipated occurrences, at least three (3) days notice shall be given the employee for assignment to work outside the Seattle distribution area.

 28.13 In case of an employee being employed at two (2) classifications in the same half day the employee shall receive the higher rate of pay for that half day except as otherwise specified in Article 36, POWER PRODUCTION, Sections 36.13 and 36.14.

 28.13.1 When an employee is appointed on a "work out of class" basis to a position in a class, with multiple pay steps, having a higher maximum salary such employee shall be paid at the nearest step in the higher range which (1) provides the employee who is not at the top step of his/her current salary range a dollar amount at least equal to the next step increase of the employee's current salary range or (2) provides the employee who is at the top step of his/her current salary range an increase in pay nearest to four percent (4%) provided that such increase shall not exceed the maximum step established for the higher paying position.

 28.13.2 Replacement relief of a higher classification shall be the same pay rate as the pay of the relieved position. Holidays falling in the replacement period shall be paid at such higher rate providing the employee works the day before and the day after the holiday. The higher rate of pay does not apply to vacation or sick leave occurring during such assignment.

 28.14 Permanent transfers to another headquarters or organizational unit to permanent vacancies in an employee's current classification (job titles listed in Schedule A) requested by Electrical Journeyworkers or employees in lower related classifications who have completed their probationary period shall be made in accordance with the following factors:

 a. The Department shall post all permanent vacancies in Electrical Journeyworker or lower related classifications for a period of not less than six (6) working days at the headquarters of the classifications affected. The Department shall furnish a copy of all postings and awards to the Union.

 b. Seniority for purposes of this Article shall be based on total employment from the most recent date of employment with the Department in one's current classification listed in Schedule "A".

The employee so designated will supervise, but will also work and shall be permitted to use the tools of their respective trade. The classification of "Powerhouse Journeyworker-in-Charge" is unique to this Bargaining Unit and the Skagit Project. Assignments to the PJIC title will be made among employees regularly appointed to titles within Schedule A.

 "Unavailable" means that the Supervisor is outside the premises of his or her powerhouse, or that the Supervisor, although within his or her premises, is either not on duty or not able to respond to the needs of powerhouse personnel.

 "Premises" shall be defined as follows:

 Ross Powerhouse Premises Ross Powerhouse and Ross dam

Those employees who were hired prior to January 1, 1973 and who subsequently opted to receive the housing incentive payments authorized by Ordinance 103058 and the Housing Incentive Program will continue to receive those incentive payments beyond the original expiration date of June 1, 1979. The Department may elect to offer these employees city-owned housing on the project under the same provisions as other pre-1973 employees in "A" above. As each of the above employees who are receiving housing receive an offer by the City Light Department to reside in city-owned housing on the Skagit Project, the employee must respond in writing within sixty (60) calendar days indicating the employee's intent to accept or decline the offer for residence in city-owned housing. The housing offered will be comparable to that offered to other employees. If declined by the employee or no response has been received, the housing incentive payments will cease sixty (60) calendar days after the date of the offer to reside in city-owned housing. If accepted, the housing incentive payment will cease no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the date the employee takes up residence in city- owned housing, whichever date is sooner.

 d. The City will continue to determine the job classifications along with the number and location of positions which are to be considered as key positions. Individuals employed in key positions will be required to live on-site at the Skagit Project to assure their availability to cope with emergencies. Employees in these key positions will continue to receive city-owned housing and utilities at no cost. It is clearly understood that future numbers and location of each classification/position considered key may be increased or decreased as determined by the City.

 The City agrees that in the event of a decrease in the key classifications/ positions, those Incumbent employees occupying the position that is no longer considered "key" will continue to receive city-owned housing and utilities at no cost for so long as they remain in that position. Employees who are hired into those positions which were previously but are no longer listed as a key classification/position, will be subject to those housing rules applicable to them based on their date of hire and the provisions of Section 36.12.

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AND

 INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL NO. 77

 1. The City of Seattle recognizes the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 77, as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of employees appointed to the position title Lineworker Pre-Apprentice.

 2. Effective January 23, 1988, the title of Lineworker Pre- Apprentice was accreted to Schedule "A" of the current bargaining agreement between the City and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 77. Lineworker Pre-Apprentices will be paid at the wage rate percentage level which is 65% of the journey level rate.

 3. Individuals entering the Pre-Apprentice position from other positions in City Light Department with a higher wage rate, will retain that wage during their time as Pre-Apprentice. Upon successful completion of the Pre-Apprentice Program individuals will be assigned to the position of Lineworker Apprentice, and assigned the first step wage rate of 67% of the existing Lineworker journey level rate. Individuals entering at a wage level higher than the existing first step wage rate for Apprentice will be advanced to the next highest apprentice and held at that rate until such time as their period of training is appropriate for the next step increment.

 4. The Pre-Apprentice position will consist of a six month (1040) training program covering physical strength training, general electrical training, on-the-job training, and climbing school. In order to proceed to the Lineworker Apprenticeship Program, each Pre- Apprentice must successfully attain the final Program standards, including physical strength standards and climbing school, at the conclusion of their full six months of training. Failure to meet the

 standards within the 1040 hours will result in removal from the Pre-

 Apprentice Program. Individuals who enter the Pre-Apprentice Program from other positions in City Light Department and who remove themselves or are removed from the Program or do not successfully attain the final Program standards will be returned to their former positions. Individuals who were not previously employed by the Department will have their employment with the Department terminated, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the employee, the Department, and the Union, in writing. Individuals whose initial employment by the Department is a Lineworker Pre-Apprentice will serve a probationary period of six months (1040 hours). Such employees may be terminated without just cause during the probationary period.

 5. All pertinent conditions of employment covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the City and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 77 shall apply to the title of Lineworker Pre-Apprentice.

 6. This Agreement shall remain in effect through January 22, 2002. APPENDIX B
