 1. INTRODUCTION

 Regulations published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in January 1995 authorize Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients to develop comprehensive approaches to promote economic development within residential neighborhoods that are home to high concentrations of low- and moderate income persons. Known as Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy (NRS) areas, these designations allow neighborhoods more flexibility with the use of federal HUD funds.

 This document proposes the designation of a NRS for Southeast Seattle, to replace the previous NRS that expired at the end of 2004. As proposed, the NRS will cover the time period from 2005 through 2012, with the understanding that it will be necessary to update and resubmit the plan to HUD for re-approval for the period of 2009 - 2012. In addition, the City will annually review progress and adjust the plan as part of the City's annual Substantial Amendment to the Consolidated Plan, as necessary.

 The NRS plan describes how the City of Seattle will use its CDBG resources in conjunction with other major local investments in Southeast Seattle to spur redevelopment of Southeast Seattle and maximize benefit to low- and moderate income persons. The other complementary initiatives covered in this NRS plan include the construction of a light rail system serving the community, redevelopment of Seattle's two largest public housing projects, and implementation of a Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle.

 The strategies and actions proposed in this NRS Plan are grouped in to three priority areas, based on extensive planning and consultation with community representatives from Southeast Seattle. These three high-priority areas are:

 * Business Development and Job Creation

 * Housing and Commercial Development

 * Parks and Public Infrastructure

 Within each priority area, the NRS plan identifies specific strategies and results, and assigns responsibility for the execution of the strategies to wide variety of public and non-profit agencies. Specific results are provided for an intermediate target date of 2008, and a final target date of 2012. All results will be revisited in 2008 to monitor progress-to-date and to determine whether adjustments are appropriate. In addition, the City and its non-profit partners will assess progress annually in a report to HUD.

 History/background of NRSA

 The purpose of the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy (NRS) program is to assist in the revitalization of economically distressed areas. The Southeast Seattle NRS was developed in response to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) authorization of the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy (NRS) program. Each NRS area conducts a community-based process to develop a Strategy and actions designed to bolster economic revitalization. This Strategy serves as a planning tool and policy framework for spending federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) dollars in the implementation of community goals. Once HUD approves the Strategy, the City of Seattle receives enhanced flexibility in using CDBG funds in the NRS area. The City's Office of Economic Development (OED) is the lead agency for managing the NRS program in Seattle.

 The selection of neighborhoods for which Neighborhood Revitalization Strategies are developed has been determined by a combination of factors. To ensure that the program serves communities with a high concentration of economic distress, neighborhoods are assessed for eligibility based upon HUD criteria and on the community's organizational capacity to carry out the Strategy. The designation is valid for five years, when the NRS must be evaluated and if appropriate, updated, and re-approved by the City Council and HUD. In the first cycle of NRSs (1999 to 2004), HUD approved NRS areas for five Seattle neighborhoods, one of which was Southeast Seattle.

 Southeast Seattle has shown evidence of revitalization; however, significant portions of Southeast Seattle remain economically distressed and have significant needs for additional economic development. At the same time, significant public and private investments are underway that present opportunities for catalyzing further revitalization. These include the construction of LINK light rail, the $50 million Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, two major public housing redevelopments, and the City of Seattle's Southeast Seattle Action Agenda released in March 2005.

 As a result, the City of Seattle, with the concurrence of community- based development organizations (CBDOs) in Southeast Seattle, is proposing to focus its resources and renew the NRS for Southeast Seattle. This will enable the City to leverage public and private investments from numerous sources targeted to Southeast Seattle and help transform a historically low-income underserved community.

 This document is the 2005 - 2008, second round, updated Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy for Southeast Seattle. The NRS contains the key revitalization goals and a comprehensive set of strategies and actions that the City is proposing to achieve those goals. The actions and associated targets are described for 2008 and 2012 to provide a longer-term framework for achieving revitalization. Within this broad spectrum is a sub-set of strategies for the use of HUD CDBG funds in Southeast Seattle, the vast majority of which will be appropriated for the activities of the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (RVCDF).

 Contents of this Document

 Section 3 describes the community outreach that resulted in the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy for Southeast Seattle. Section 4, Community Context, lays out the proposed boundaries for the Southeast Seattle NRSA. Section 5, Assessment, describes the current economic conditions in Southeast Seattle, and challenges and opportunities for revitalization. Section 6 details the community vision and priorities for Southeast Seattle in three topical areas: Business Development and Job Creation, Housing and Commercial Development, and Parks and Public Infrastructure. Section 7 springboards from the key strategies to specific actions which City agencies and community-based organizations (CBDOs) will undertake to implement the strategies. Each action is paired with performance-based results so residents, implementers and funders may track progress. Section 8 describes the proposed method that the City of Seattle and the community will use to monitor and evaluate progress toward revitalization in Southeast Seattle.

 2. COMMUNITY CONSULTATION

 The Southeast Seattle NRS is built on extensive community consultation and numerous past and recent planning initiatives. Several venues served as opportunities for involvement, including recent neighborhood planning efforts in Southeast Seattle, as well as direct outreach conducted specifically for the development of this NRS.

 Recent planning initiatives

 Southeast Seattle Action Agenda. In the autumn of 2004, this community-led, City-staffed planning process was initiated to develop goals and strategies for Southeast Seattle in five topical areas: Business and Job Creation, Physical Development, Education and Workforce Development, Public Safety/Image, and Arts, Culture and Public Space. A broad cross-section of community leaders that represented residents, businesses, social services, educational institutions, and non-profits, was involved in this effort. Sub- committees were organized for each of the five topic areas and over the initial five-month planning effort, approximately 13 subgroup and 3 full group meetings, involving approximately 50 people, were held. Over the course of the two-month community outreach process, over 600 community residents/members were involved and over eleven neighborhood meetings were conducted. The resulting product, the Southeast Seattle Action Agenda, is a living document that will continually be refined and updated in support of community revitalization in Southeast Seattle. Recommendations from this planning process have strongly influenced the development of this NRS.

 Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (RVCDF). The Rainier Valley Community Development Fund is a $50 million fund established to support community development in the Rainier Valley, which comprises the primary geographic area of the Southeast Seattle NRS. The City of Seattle, along with Sound Transit and King County, established this Fund to support light rail mitigation and overall community development in Southeast Seattle. The City of Seattle is the most significant source for this Fund, committing $42.8 of the $50 million. In addition to the funding appropriations, the City has also committed to supporting the creation and development of a community-based development organization, the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (RVCDF), to oversee and administer the use of monies from the Fund for the revitalization of Southeast Seattle.

 Since its inception in 2002, the RVCDF has focused its work on providing supplemental mitigation assistance to businesses being impacted by construction of Seattle's light rail line. As supplemental mitigation activities ramp down in the next two years with the completion of light rail construction, RVCDF will accelerate the Fund's Community Development Program. The Community Development Program will be capitalized primarily by federal CDBG monies appropriated by the City of Seattle. In the past year, the RVCDF has facilitated an extensive community process to shape its community development program. The results of those efforts have directly influenced the NRS strategies in this document.

 The RVCDF's work has been organized as the result of significant community engagement since its inception. A community-based Founding Board was created to build the organizational structure and legal foundations for the RVCDF. A community-identified Board currently leads the organization. The most recent process to develop the Community Development Program has been comprised of a stakeholder Steering Committee, community surveys, Technical Advisory Committees, targeted community outreach, and targeted interviews. The creation of the Community Development Program alone has involved several hundred community members in over a hundred meetings.

 Housing Investment Areas. In 2003, the Seattle City Council asked the Office of Housing to reexamine the City's Special Objectives Area (SOA) guidelines, which had been adopted over twenty years ago to prevent over-concentration of subsidized housing in economically distressed areas. The process involved analyzing data to identify changes and trends in historically distressed areas and presenting the information to residents and community groups as part of in-depth discussions. These discussions would help the community to identify strategies to achieve housing and community development goals for their neighborhoods. One of the results of the process was designation of eight Housing Investment Areas (HIAs) throughout Seattle, one of which includes a large part of the Rainier Valley. HIA strategies are broader than those for the former SOAs in that they seek to achieve community development and revitalization objectives unique to each area. One of the key HIA strategies is targeting of funds for two Housing Levy programs (the Neighborhood Housing Opportunity Program and the Homebuyer Assistance Program) primarily in those areas.

 Other Community Planning Efforts. Several important planning processes have been conducted in Southeast Seattle in the past fifteen years, including the creation of neighborhood plans (1996 to 1999), light rail station area plans (1998 to 2001), and the Southeast Action Plan (1990 to 1991).

 Key Community Organizations

 The Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (RVCDF) is the primary community organization that will utilize CDBG funds to implement the strategies and actions described in this NRS. The RVCDF was established in 2002 as a community-based response to the construction of light rail transit in Southeast Seattle. Since then, RVCDF has worked to support community development in the areas of small business development and physical revitalization.

 In addition to the RVCDF, SEED and HomeSight are also key community- based development organizations, specializing in catalytic real estate development and home-ownership respectively. SEED and HomeSight were involved in developing the 1999 NRSA for Southeast Seattle, and have been involved in all the planning efforts described above. This has provided a strong link and assurance that the strategies in the 2005 NRS are consistent with and supportive of other community plans and initiatives.

 The community organizations were consulted individually early in the process of developing the NRSA, to help identify and/or validate revitalization priorities, actions and benchmarks. They also reviewed drafts of the NRS and helped shape it leading up to the final NRS.

 How area meets demographic criteria

 The revitalization strategies contained in this document apply to the designated area depicted in the map below and meet the following criteria:

 * The area is comprised of census tracts and block groups where, when taken as an aggregate, more than 54.7% of households are low or moderate-income. The threshold of 54.7% is the "upper quartile percentage" or top 25% of low or moderate-income block groups in Seattle. This is the basic qualifying criteria in order for a neighborhood to qualify as a NRSA. Within the boundaries of the Southeast NRSA, 61.5% of residents are low or moderate income.

 * The Southeast NRSA is primarily residential.

 * All block groups within the designated NRSA are contiguous.

 Geographic Focus

 The revitalization area described above is also roughly contiguous with the designated Investment Area for the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund. One key difference is that the western boundary of the NRS area includes parts of Beacon Hill that contain significant low and moderate income Census tracts. The RVCDF Investment Area does not include Beacon Hill because the original mandate of the Community Development Fund is to target the Rainier Valley floor, which is the area in which the light rail surface alignment will be located.

 The community has identified several existing and emerging business districts within the NRS area that are priorities for investment. These business areas include: North Rainier/McClellan, Columbia City/Edmunds, Martin Luther King Jr. Way at Graham/Orcas, Martin Luther King Jr. Way at Othello, and Rainier Beach/Henderson. These areas are consistent with targeted areas as described in the Southeast Action Agenda and the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund's Operating Plan for community development.

[Southeast Area NRSA Boundary](/~ordpics/115310A2.gif)

 History and Geography

 Southeast Seattle was first settled in the last part of the 19th century. The area's exceptional timber stands led to construction of timber mills, farming, and residential development. Columbia City, in the heart of the valley, was incorporated as a city in 1892 and later annexed into the City of Seattle. In 1978, the Columbia City Landmark District was established by the City of Seattle, and in 1980 the district was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

 The area has historically been a largely minority, under-invested and low-income area. The Seattle Housing Authority has two major public housing complexes in Southeast Seattle: Rainier Vista and Holly Park. In the last five years, both complexes have undergone major renovation into mixed-use, mixed-income communities integrated with surrounding neighborhoods.

 In the 1970's and early 1980's Southeast Seattle and the Rainier Valley suffered the loss of major retail and commercial businesses, including basic retail such as grocery stores. The area's economy slowed and increases in the numbers of residents living in poverty further eroded the commercial base.

 The population of the NRS area, while primarily Southeast Asian and African-American, includes all of Seattle's ethnic groups. Recognized as the area of the city with the greatest cultural diversity, Southeast Seattle currently attracts more recent immigrants than any other part of the city. Since the 1980s, many Southeast Asian businesses in particular have opened establishments along Martin Luther King Jr. Way, one of two main corridors that form the backbone of Southeast Seattle. More recently, refugees from East African countries have also settled in the area, further adding to the diverse mix of groups in the community.

 4. EXISTING CONDITIONS

 Socioeconomic Conditions and Characteristics

 * Southeast Seattle has historically been a low-income, underinvested community. The population of nearly 45,000 includes 61.5% low and moderate-income households, compared with 43.9% for the citywide. 17.0% of households live in poverty, compared with 11.8% citywide.1

 * The unemployment rate in Southeast Seattle is 8.3%, while for all of Seattle it was 5.1% in 1999.2 In terms of academic achievement, 15.5% of Southeast students passed the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) compared with 34.4% citywide.3

 * Southeast Seattle is also very racially diverse compared with the rest of Seattle. Foreign born residents comprise 36.2% of Southeast Seattle compared with 16.9 across the city. Nonwhite households comprise 80.1% of the total population, compared with 29.9% for the city as a whole.4

 * Historically, Southeast Seattle has experienced significant underinvestment in business and real estate development. Often, development projects are not built because the market is not mature enough; development costs exceed project value and render projects financially infeasible. Additional public assistance is needed to boost the financial feasibility of development projects, especially those that would spur further revitalization.5

 * There is also a gap in local services that forces many residents to go outside the community to meet their shopping needs. A survey conducted by the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund in Southeast Seattle reported that more than 60% of respondents expressed a need for more local businesses. Availability of more varied services would reduce retail leakage into neighboring areas.6

 * Recent years have seen greater public and private investment: the construction of light rail as major public transportation infrastructure; refugee and immigrant businesses; gradual strengthening of business districts such as Columbia City, North Rainier, Rainier Beach; and public housing redevelopments at Rainier Vista and NewHolly.

 * These recent public and private investments will help spur additional revitalization in Southeast Seattle; however, existing conditions still indicate a need for further revitalization. At the same time, the Southeast community has established its goal that revitalization take place in a manner that is beneficial to, rather than exclusive or displacing of, existing residents and businesses.

 Barriers to Revitalization

 A number of challenges exist in achieving the community revitalization vision for Southeast Seattle:

 Lack of capital to support business development. Small businesses are an integral part of the Rainier Valley economy. They provide for the needs of neighborhoods, and they provide jobs and income for residents. Many new businesses benefit from the Valley's role as an incubator for new economic entities. Yet many do not have access to credit through traditional sources, and subsequently face difficulty finding the capital to expand their businesses or sustain them through difficult business cycles.

 Under-invested and under-utilized real estate/properties. Despite pockets of recent real estate activity, much of which is either the result of public investment or strong grassroots efforts, new investment is still slow in coming to Southeast Seattle. Often, this is because development costs continue to exceed what investors expect to earn in rents or purchase prices. As a result, the community still has many under-utilized and poorly maintained properties.

 Retail leakage. Local businesses capture only a portion of local spending. A significant level of residential spending on goods and services is met outside of Southeast Seattle. Business development has not reached its potential capacity.

 5. REVITALIZATION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

 Community Vision

 As described in section 3, a community-led, City-staffed planning initiative called the Southeast Seattle Action Agenda took place in the fall of 2004. This process affirmed many of the community revitalization goals that emerged from previous processes, and further refined strategies and actions for the dynamic conditions of Southeast Seattle today. Out of the Southeast Seattle Action Agenda process, the community developed the following vision:

 Southeast Seattle is a vibrant community where: racial, cultural and economic diversity is embraced and preserved; immigrants are welcomed; all residents have access to economic and educational opportunities, housing, and cultural and recreational amenities; and the economic benefits generated by public and private investments are shared with current residents, businesses and community institutions.

 The Southeast NRS adopts this vision and a set of strategies intended to foster equitable development in Southeast Seattle by which existing residents and local entrepreneurs as well as future residents and business owners realize the benefits of revitalization, increased prosperity, property values and community well-being. In carrying out the strategies, CBDOs and city agencies will take actions to not displace residents and businesses that desire to remain in the NRSA, including but not limited to offering financial resources to existing businesses and providing increased affordable rental and ownership housing options to residents.

 Revitalization Priorities

 The community consultation efforts described previously have also articulated the community's needs and development goals. The Southeast Action Agenda along with numerous previous planning initiatives have identified key areas for community revitalization. The NRS focuses on three high-priority areas:

 * Business Development and Job Creation

 * Housing and Commercial Development

 * Parks and Public Infrastructure

 Business Development and Job Creation. The community has identified as a priority the need to support business development in Southeast Seattle. This support will largely be in the form of providing additional investment through loans and grants to businesses, as well as technical assistance. Much of this work will be facilitated by the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund through the resources of its Community Development loan fund, which is being capitalized primarily with CDBG dollars. The City will also support this goal through other commitments such as assisting with marketing efforts and piloting a wireless internet access area. The objectives of this goal are to:

 1. Encourage local ownership of properties and businesses.

 2. Provide opportunities for local businesses to benefit from the increased economic activity that will result from the substantial public and private investment planned for the area.

 3. Diversify and increase the availability of retail goods, services and jobs within the Rainier Valley.

 4. Preserve the multi-ethnic mix of local entrepreneurs.

 5. Promote local residential spending that reinvests in the community while strengthening the area's role as a shopping destination.

 6. Increase employment opportunities through the strengthening of Rainier Valley businesses.

 Housing and Commercial Development. The community has also identified as a priority the need to encourage continued investment in housing and commercial development in Southeast Seattle. As with business development, much of this support will be in the form of providing loans and grants as incentives to property owners and developers, facilitated by the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund through the resources of its Community Development loan fund, which is being capitalized primarily with CDBG dollars. The City will also support this priority area through investment in housing and mixed-use catalyst developments. The objectives of this goal are to:

 7. Promote opportunities for housing, commercial, mixed-use and transit-oriented developments that benefits the people who live and work in the Rainier Valley.

 8. Preserve the unique characteristics of existing neighborhoods and their racial, cultural and economic diversity.

 9. Improve Rainier Valley's physical environment by enhancing the commercial and multi-family residential building stock.

 10. Augment the supply of affordable housing to limit the potential for displacement caused by rising living costs associated with increased public and private investment.

 Parks and Public Infrastructure. The City will support physical revitalization through other commitments to invest in new open space, build an effective multimodal transportation system, and support expansion of community and cultural facilities.

 11. Improve the quality of the built environment in the Rainier Valley by supporting improvements in open space, transportation and infrastructure.

 12. Increase cultural and recreational opportunities and programs that reflect the Rainier Valley's diverse population into all community development strategies.

 6. STRATEGIES, ACTIONS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES

 This section includes current and future strategies to support revitalization in Southeast Seattle. The strategies provide the shape and direction for neighborhood revitalization and are the link between broad goals and objectives and specific implementation actions. The strategies are borne primarily from elements of the Southeast Seattle Action Agenda.

 In this section, each strategy is grouped by goal, related to objectives and followed by action steps which are being or will be undertaken by CBDOs and/or City agencies. Performance results are also included for each action. Results are provided for an intermediate target date of 2008, and a final target date of 2012. All results will be revisited in 2008 to monitor progress-to-date and to determine whether adjustments are appropriate. Note that projected results are cumulative; 2012 figures include 2008 projections. In addition, the NRS will comply with annual reporting requirements to HUD. Where the City has already begun to complete an action or made a definitive commitment to complete an action, this is also indicated.

 The strategies and actions are grouped by the three priority areas; within each, specific strategies fall into one of two categories: 1) Those that describe how HUD Block Grant Funds will be used to support the Community Development Program of the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund and 2) Other public investments that will support revitalization in Southeast Seattle.

 7. HUD REGULATORY FRAMEWORK/IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

 In Southeast Seattle, the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (RVCDF) will be one of the key community-based organizations with primary responsibility for implementing the strategies and actions described in this NRS. The RVCDF was incorporated in 2002 as 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to correct the causes of "community deterioration through forms of debt or equity to distressed small businesses and to nonprofit institutions and other organizations working directly with those otherwise disadvantaged by such problems." In this capacity, the RVCDF is leading the implementation of the $50 million Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle (the Fund). The City, King County and Sound Transit agreed to create this Fund in 1999 to help mitigate impacts of light rail construction and to support revitalization in Southeast Seattle.

 An Operating Plan adopted by the City of Seattle and Sound Transit in 2002 describes the initial purposes of the Fund to assist businesses impacted by light rail construction. This work is referred to as supplemental mitigation account activities and has been administered by the RVCDF since its inception. However, the long-term vision for the Fund is to use a large portion of it to contribute to the long- term revitalization of the Rainier Valley. Over the last two years, the Rainier Valley community, led by the Board of the RVCDF, has worked with City, County and Sound Transit staff to develop a Community Development Program as an amendment to the original Operating Plan. This amendment will define and govern the activities, products, and approaches to program delivery and accountability for the Fund.

 The Rainier Valley Community has established goals for the Community Development Program that will be incorporated into the amendment to the Operating Plan. They are as follows:

 * Support projects that benefit low- and moderate-income residents, businesses, and institutions in the Rainier Valley.

 * Use community development funds as a catalyst for fostering commercial and residential development in the Rainier Valley.

 * Improve Rainier Valley's physical environment by enhancing the commercial and multi-family residential building stock.

 * Encourage local ownership of properties and businesses.

 * Increase employment opportunities through the strengthening of Rainier Valley businesses.

 * Augment the supply of affordable housing to limit the potential for displacement caused by rising living costs associated with increased public and private investment.

 In addition to accomplishing these goals, the community has established a complementary goal of using a portion of the Fund to support the establishment of a community development financial institution that can invest in the Rainier Valley for many years to come. As such, the RVCDF will administer and implement the Community Development Program of the Fund and originate loans as a Community Based Development Organization (CBDO), as defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), using federal Community Development Block Grant funds provided by the City of Seattle. The revenues from the original loans using CDBG would be held permanently in Trust for the benefit of the Rainier Valley Community and administered by the RVCDF in its capacity as Trustee. The amendment to the Operating Plan will establish the parameters of the Trust relationship and a subsequent Trust Agreement will determine the specific responsibilities of the RVCDF.

 The Community Development Program will be capitalized by public funds to be appropriated by the City of Seattle between 2005 and 2012 to pay for activities defined in the Operating Plan Amendment. Of the total $50 million mandated for use in Southeast Seattle, up to $21.5 million may be spent on supplemental mitigation activities, and $2 million is earmarked for a four-year pre-apprenticeship job training program, per the original 2002 Operating Plan. The remainder will be available for the Community Development Program as defined in the Operating Plan Amendment. Any residual funds not used for supplemental mitigation activities, any funds repaid from supplemental mitigation advances (unless recommitted for supplemental mitigation) and any interest earned on community development loan payments will be dedicated to eligible activities defined in the Operating Plan Amendment.

 The Community Development Program will focus on needs identified through several community-based planning efforts, including the Southeast Action Agenda developed in the autumn of 2004. These efforts have consistently identified two critical community priorities: 1) supporting business growth and development, and 2) promoting physical improvements in the Rainier Valley. The Community Development Program is a direct and strategic response to these objectives.

 The Community Development Program will consist of two lines of business: Business Development and Real Estate Development. For the initial use of funds for community development purposes, 25% of funds governed by the Operating Plan Amendment will be targeted to Business Development and 75% will be targeted to Real Estate Development. Business Development encourages small business formation, strengthens existing businesses in the Rainier Valley, and promotes job creation. Business loan and grant products include a Business Interest Subsidy Grant, a Business Incentive Loan, and a Facade Improvement Grant.

 Real Estate Development encourages new catalyst development and physical improvements in the Rainier Valley. This includes a range of physical revitalization activities involving both new construction and rehabilitation of existing building stock, for the purpose of stimulating economic activity, increasing the inventory of commercial spaces for Rainier Valley businesses, and promoting affordable housing for Rainier Valley residents. Real estate loan and grant products include a Site Assembly Loan for Non-profits, a Site Assembly Loan for For-profits, a Site Assembly Interest Subsidy Loan, and a Real Estate Financing Loan.

 As the implementing organization of the Community Development Program, the RVCDF will maximize benefit to the community in the most cost- effective manner, strategically using its strengths and expertise, while leveraging the strengths and expertise of other community partners when appropriate. As such, the RVCDF will directly provide some products, while others will be offered in conjunction with established partner organizations.

 In order to achieve the community's revitalization goals, the City of Seattle is proposing to use a portion of the CDBG funds dedicated to the Fund as identified below:

 1. Business Interest Subsidy Grant: The Business Interest Subsidy Grant will address an existing gap in business lending by enhancing the access of Rainier Valley businesses to loan products currently offered by community-based lending organizations. This product targets borrowers who are less experienced, have poorer credit, and/or inadequate personal assets that could be used as "collateral." The purpose of this grant is to provide an opportunity for those businesses to improve their operations. The grants can be used for working capital or for machinery and equipment.

 RVCDF will market the product to eligible businesses and will partner with an existing organization that currently provides a business loan product. The partner organization will originate the loan using its own monies, and the RVCDF will provide a commitment to pay half of the borrower's annual interest costs on the loan. The effect of the grant would be to lower the interest cost to the borrowing business and provide additional lending capacity in the Rainier Valley. Each individual transaction will be approved by the RVCDF Board and subject to a final CDBG eligibility determination by the City of Seattle.

 The City of Seattle is proposing that HUD release the entire interest subsidy grant upon a determination of eligibility rather than release small monthly grants over a ten year period. This will simplify administration of the Fund and substantially reduce the workload for RVCDF and City staff. Any interest earned off the interest subsidy grant will be treated as program income and subject to all HUD rules governing the treatment of program income.

 2. Site Assembly Interest Subsidy Loans: This product will help address the impediment of high carrying costs for land using currently available loan products. The product supports site acquisition and land assembly for CDBG eligible projects undertaken by non-profit developers. The Fund will help these developers by assuming some of the cost of assembling land in the Rainier Valley for CDBG eligible projects. RVCDF will partner with an organization that already funds site acquisition for non-profit developers. The partner organization will provide a loan for site acquisition for a CDBG eligible project, and the Fund will provide an interest-free loan for up to 50% of the interest costs of the primary loan.

 The City of Seattle interprets 24 Code of Federal Regulations Part 570.203 to allow the use of interest supplements to support a CDBG eligible economic development undertaken by a private non-profit corporation, as proposed under this product of the Fund. HUD confirmation of that interpretation is hereby requested as part of their review of this Southeast Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy.

 8. EVALUATION AND MONITORING

 The revitalization strategies and actions described above are aimed at making Southeast neighborhoods more livable and economically vibrant for new and existing residents alike. Such outcomes are in concert with Seattle's Comprehensive Plan goals and are the intended result of the Southeast Seattle NRS.

 How will we know that revitalization is happening? At what point will barriers limiting private market investment be overcome? And how can a balance be achieved between upgrading residents' incomes, local housing values and business investment while still retaining economic and ethnic diversity? While these are difficult questions, we believe a rigorous solution lies in a two-pronged approach to monitoring and evaluating NRSA activities and results.

 First, this document includes Output measures for each activity and identifies the public or non- profit agency responsible for the result. These measures, as described in Section 7, are 4-year targets toward which progress will be assessed annually. Second, the City of Seattle will use indicators to assess the overall Outcome of revitalization as defined by a more livable and economically vibrant Southeast Seattle. The indicators below are directly related to the socioeconomic conditions described in Section 5. They have been selected because they are available on a regular basis over time, are relatively cost-efficient to obtain, and can act as a proxy to answer the broader question of "How do we know if Southeast Seattle is revitalizing?"

 Revitalization outcomes will be reported in 2008 and 2012. The 2012 evaluation will include a community profile showing demographic and market changes in the SE NRSA, based on the results of the 2010 Census. The Census is the best source of information to allow a detailed look at changes in household incomes, race and ethnicity, homeownership rates, and other community characteristics within the NRSA boundaries. This information will help the City and the community assess whether, and to what extent, the revitalization has occurred at the expense of the racial and economic makeup of the Rainier Valley. It is the intent of this strategy to achieve economic revitalization with minimum impact on the racial, ethnic and economic diversity that distinguishes the Rainier Valley.

 In addition, outcomes of the SE NRSA will be evaluated in 2008 and 2012 based on the indicators provided below:

 HOUSING INDICATORS

 Existing Condition: Historically, Southeast Seattle has been underinvested in real estate development. Public support is needed to increase the economic feasibility of new workforce housing, which would boost revitalization.7 Providing housing units that are affordable to lower-income families is another important NRSA goal.

 Indicators of Revitalization:

 * Progress toward the Comprehensive Plan 2024 residential growth targets for the four Rainier Valley urban villages, which call for 2,890 net new households.

 * In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan, at least 20% of new housing units would be affordable to households earning up to 50% of median income and at least 17% of new housing units would be affordable to households earning 51-80% of median income.8

 * Maintain or increase the supply of rental housing affordable to households with incomes up to 60% of median income, which is currently about 3,750 units.9

 EMPLOYMENT/BUSINESS INDICATORS

 Existing Condition: Gaps in local services force many residents to go outside the community to meet their shopping needs. A more diverse range of available services would increase spending in Southeast Seattle and support business growth.10 An increase in jobs within the NRSA would be another sign of economic revitalization.

 Indicators of Revitalization:

 * An increase in the number of City business licenses in Southeast using the 2004 figures as a baseline.

 * An increase in the number of loans to small business owners in the Rainier Valley originated by the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, Community Capital Development and Cascadia Revolving Loan Fund using the 2004 totals as a baseline.

 * Progress toward the Comprehensive Plan 2024 employment growth target for the North Rainier Hub Urban Village, which calls for 750 net new jobs.

 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS

 Existing Condition: Recent years have seen greater investment in Southeast Seattle, particularly due to light rail construction and major redevelopment at Rainier Vista and NewHolly by Seattle Housing Authority.

 Indicator of Revitalization: Private-market residential and commercial development underway in the McClellan and Othello LINK light rail station areas.

 APPENDIX H

 H O U S I N G P O L I C I E S

 The policies outlined in this Appendix H to the Consolidated Plan pertain to all capital funds administered by the Seattle Office of Housing (OH) unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the currently applicable 2002 Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan for additional policies governing the use of 2002 Housing Levy funds.

 Affordable Rental Housing Policies

 Rental Housing Priorities

 The rental housing priorities described below indicate the types of rental housing the City is most interested in funding, but are not listed in priority order. Proposed projects not meeting one or more these priorities may still be considered for City funding.

 PRIORITY: HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN

 Particular interest:

 * The area of greatest need based on 2000 Census special tabulation data provided by HUD is housing for extremely low-income families (0- 30% of MI);

 * Supportive transitional and permanent housing for families who are homeless, including projects participating in the Gates Foundation Sound Families Initiative.

 Needs rationale:

 * Over 5,000 extremely low-income families in Seattle have housing problems as defined by HUD, meaning they pay more than they can afford for rent and utilities (i.e., > 30% of their income), live in overcrowded conditions, or lack complete kitchen and plumbing facilities. Almost 60% of extremely low-income families pay more than one-half of their household income for rent and utilities.

 * The October 2003 One Night Count found that 369 families with children were living in shelters or transitional housing.

 * Preliminary findings from a recent evaluation of the Sound Families Initiative found positive outcomes for homeless families, with two- thirds moving on to stable housing, and slightly more than half with increased monthly income.

 PRIORITY: HOUSING FOR SMALL HOUSEHOLDS

 Particular interest:

 * The area of greatest need among Seattle's small households is for housing for extremely low-income (0-30% of MI) single individuals;

 * Permanent supportive housing projects serving people who are chronically homeless and/or disabled.

 Needs rationale:

 * In Seattle, over 10,000 extremely low-income singles (under the age of 62) and another 2,500 extremely low-income seniors who live alone or with others pay more than one-half of their income for rent and utilities.

 * The Seattle-King County Health Care for the Homeless Network (HCHN) estimated that, in 2002, at least 4,900 single men and women in the downtown Seattle area met the definition of chronically homeless, meaning they had been homeless for a year or longer or had four or more episodes of homelessness in the past three years.

 * Ninety-eight percent of persons who are homeless or who live in transitional housing report either having no source of income or having extremely low incomes through social security, unemployment insurance, or State general assistance.

 * Most homeless persons suffer from one or more disabilities, such as mental illness, chemical or alcohol dependency, and/or chronic and acute medical conditions.

 * National studies have documented the success of supportive housing models on multiple levels:

 * utilization of health services (decreases in emergency room visits, hospitalization, and emergency detoxification, and increases in preventive health care services);

 * employment status (increase in earned income and employment rates when employment services are provided in supportive housing, and decrease in dependence on entitlements);

 * treatment of mental illness (decreased symptoms of schizophrenia and depression); and

 * ending substance abuse (much higher success rates for people living in supportive housing).

 PRIORITY: PRESERVATION OF SUBSIDIZED RENTAL HOUSING PROJECTS WITH EXPIRING AFFORDABILITY RESTRICTIONS

 Particular interest:

 * Projects that preserve affordable units that are at risk due to expiring project-based Section 8 subsidy.

 * Preservation of tax credit projects with expiring affordability restrictions, if rents are currently below-market and buildings serve a significant number of very low-income (0-50% of MI) households.

 Needs rationale:

 * The Washington Low Income Housing Alliance estimates that 984 affordable units in 19 buildings in Seattle are at risk of being lost by 2006 due to expiring project-based Section 8 subsidies.

 * In addition, a list provided by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission in January 2004 showed 19 other low-income housing tax credit buildings (1,023 units) in Seattle with affordability restrictions that will be expiring by 2006. Some of this affordable housing stock may be at risk of converting to market-rate.

 PRIORITY: HOUSING THAT HELPS ADDRESS SPECIFIED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

 Particular interest:

 Affordable workforce housing (generally housing affordable to households with incomes 31-80% of MI) that furthers revitalization or other community development goals in Housing Investment Areas. Strategies and priorities for Housing Investment Areas are identified in the Levy Administrative & Financial Plan, Consolidated Plan, and neighborhood plans.

 * New construction of affordable housing in urban centers, especially those lagging in meeting their residential growth targets as identified in the Comprehensive Plan or those where affordable housing is needed to help mitigate displacement of low-income people due to gentrification.

 * Transit-oriented development projects that are generally located within 1/2 mile of a light rail station or major transit center.

 Needs rationale:

 * Mixed-use and multifamily development projects are needed in certain Seattle neighborhoods, particularly ones where the private market is not developing due to economic distress or other factors. Such projects fulfill both housing and commercial needs, and higher-density populations and pedestrian- or transit-friendly orientation meet goals of smart growth, the Growth Management Act, and neighborhood plans.

 * The market in some Seattle neighborhoods is not mature enough to support desired mixed-use and residential development without public subsidies. Non-profit developers often are relied on to lead community development and revitalization in distressed areas.

 * Housing is integrally connected to targeted community development strategies, as well as to wealth creation efforts for economically disadvantaged families and individuals. Affordable housing not only benefits residents, but also contributes to security and stability of neighborhoods. As neighborhoods revitalize, continued provision of affordable housing helps enable existing residents to continue to live there.

 * Locating affordable housing near employment centers and public transit reduces household transportation costs and increases transportation choices.

 Affordability Policies

 The policies described in this section apply to capital funds awarded by OH for production or rehabilitation to provide or preserve affordable rental housing, including HOME and CDBG funds, except that these policies do not apply to Housing Levy funds, Sound Families funds, programs where the City leverages other funds through credit enhancement strategies, other City fund sources for which specific affordability guidelines are adopted by City legislation, mitigation funds that are used to provide affordable rental housing in accordance with the findings of a nexus study, or funds used for bridge loans (but amounts repaid on bridge loans and bridge loans converted to long-term financing are subject to these policies unless the fund source for the bridge loan was otherwise exempt). Affordability policies for Levy funds are provided in the Levy Administrative & Financial Plan.

 The following rental affordability policies apply to permanent capital funding appropriated for use in a biennial budget cycle (e.g. 2005- 2006):

 * At least 50% of rental program funds shall be used for units with affordable rents for extremely low-income households;

 * Remaining rental program funds shall be used for units with affordable rents for very low-income households, except:

 * Funds may be used to produce or preserve units with affordable rents for low-income households, that are not affordable to very low-income households, in the Central Area, Rainier Valley/Beacon Hill, Delridge/Westwood, South Park, Pioneer Square, and International District Housing Investment Areas as described in Appendix G of this Consolidated Plan;

 * Funds may be used to produce or preserve units with affordable rents for low-income households, that are not affordable to very low-income households, within half a mile of a light rail station or major transit center located outside of Downtown;

 * Funds may be used to acquire or rehabilitate an existing, occupied project and subsidize some units affordable to low-income households, but occupied by over-income households with incomes up to 80% of median income. Such funds will be considered to have been used for housing affordable to extremely low-income households or very low- income households, respectively, to the extent the units are required to be occupied solely by, and affordable to, such households within 2 years of the date of the loan agreement. In such case, the initial regulatory term will be established for a 52-year period. By the end of the initial 2-year period after the date of the loan agreement, over-income households need to be relocated or the Borrower will be in default and required to return a prorata portion of the OH funding.

 Rent Standards and Eligible Households

 Except as provided in the Affordability Policies above, program funds are to be used only for units that are occupied or will be initially occupied by eligible households at affordable rents for the respective income categories.

 For the purposes of the Consolidated Plan, "affordable rent" for low- income households means annual rent not exceeding 30% of 80% of median income; affordable rent for very low-income households means an annual rent not exceeding 30% of 50% of median income; and affordable rent for extremely low-income households means an annual rent not exceeding 30% of 30% of median income. For the purposes of determining whether a unit bears affordable rent, the term "rent" includes the rent paid by the tenant plus an allowance for utilities paid by the tenant.

 Tenant households with income above the applicable eligibility levels are called "over-income households." City funding is not available for units that are occupied at the time of funding by residents with household income greater than 80% of median income. The City may require as a funding condition that units occupied by such households, although not City-funded, become rent-regulated under a City regulatory agreement when occupancy changes.

 Siting Policy

 Unless the Director waives the siting policy as stated below, OH will not fund, or certify as consistent with this Consolidated Plan, a project if the proposed number of subsidized rental housing units for extremely low-income households would exceed the capacity for additional subsidized rental housing units for extremely low-income households in the Census block group where the proposed project is located.

 Capacity for additional subsidized rental housing units for extremely low-income households is defined as:

 * The total number of housing units in the Census block group according to the latest information as updated annually by the Department of Planning and Development (DPD), multiplied by 20%;

 * Less the number of existing subsidized rental housing units for extremely low-income households in the Census block group according to the latest report available from OH (OH's inventory of subsidized rental housing in Seattle includes projects with capital subsidies from public agencies; i.e. City-funded projects as well as non-City funded projects as reported annually by county, state and federal agencies).

 The siting policy does not apply to projects located within Downtown because of its special nature as a high priority area for affordable housing investment. A map of Downtown is included in Appendix G of this Consolidated Plan.

 The OH Director may grant a waiver of the siting policy if one or more of the following criteria is met:

 * The proposed project is a "neighborhood-supported project".

 To be considered a neighborhood-supported project, OH will need to determine that the proposed project is supported by a reasonable number of immediate neighbors and/or affected neighborhood organizations. Such determination will be based on review of results of the community notification process as described in the Good Neighborhood Guidelines section of this Appendix H, including notification of immediate neighbors, consultation with established community groups, public meetings, and/or other means of community notification as OH deems appropriate. In accordance with national, state and local fair housing laws, OH disregards, in evaluating neighborhood support for the project, any opposition that appears to be based on characteristics of future residents of a project if discrimination based on such characteristics is prohibited.

 * Additional market-rate housing development is planned in the Census block group, and OH determines that the proposed project would not result in more than 20% of total housing units in the block group being subsidized rental housing for extremely low-income households, based on an adjusted estimate of total housing units that includes units for which building permits have been issued (based on the Department of Planning & Development's latest annual report of building permit data) or other such documentation as deemed appropriate by OH.

 * OH determines that natural or manmade barriers (e.g. a bluff, waterway, or freeway) physically separate the proposed project from existing concentrations of subsidized rental housing for extremely low-income households.

 Bridge Loan Policy

 OH bridge loans are intended to provide short-term funding to permit housing projects to proceed in advance of the availability of permanent project funding. Bridge loan funding is available to enable property acquisition, construction or rehabilitation to proceed when the borrower can provide assurance that permanent funding will be available from other sources on acceptable terms within a reasonable time period to repay the bridge loan. Given reasonable assurance of repayment, bridge loans may also be made for acquiring at-risk Section 8 preservation projects or to assist in the acquisition of sites or buildings in designated Housing Investment Areas or in certain neighborhood areas in order to implement neighborhood plan-identified strategies advocated by community organizations. Applications for bridge loans may be made outside of OH's NOFA process.

 Bridge loans for affordable housing are made utilizing any OH- administered fund sources determined to be appropriate by the OH Director. The maximum term of a bridge loan shall be two years. OH shall require payment of a reasonable rate of interest, which shall be no less than 3% simple interest. In addition, a loan fee may be charged for providing the bridge loan. A bridge loan may be made as a component of a larger loan that includes long-term financing.

 OH may allow all or a portion of a bridge loan to be converted to a permanent loan subject to maximum subsidy limits for all OH and other City agency administered or allocated capital funds that may be combined to provide permanent gap financing for the housing portion of a project, pursuant to the Levy Administrative & Financial Plan, and availability of permanent fund sources. Conversion to a long-term loan may be conditioned upon affordability restrictions for additional units.

 Homebuyer Assistance Program Policies

 The policies that follow apply to City Homebuyer Assistance Program funds, including Levy, American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI), and other HOME funds. Additional policies pertaining to Housing Levy Homebuyer Assistance Program funds are provided in the Levy Administrative & Financial Plan.

 Eligible Use of Funds

 * HOME funds, including ADDI funds, may be used for home purchase assistance and development of affordable units to be sold to eligible low-income households.

 * All types of for-sale units are eligible, including single-family residences, condominiums, limited equity cooperatives, co-housing, land trusts, and homes on leased land.

 * The maximum home purchase price is the same as the FHA mortgage limit, as adjusted annually or 95 percent of the median purchase price for single family housing in Seattle as documented according to HUD requirements/.

 * Borrowers must purchase a home in Seattle and use it as their principal residence. Purchases of investment properties are not allowed under this program. Homes with an accessory dwelling unit are eligible, provided that the borrower is an owner-occupant of the home. A lease-to-own contract may be considered a purchase.

 Homebuyer Eligibility

 * Borrowers must have household incomes at or below 80% of median income.

 * Each borrower or the borrower's family must be a "first-time homebuyer", which is defined as any individual and his or her spouse who have not owned a home during the three-year period prior to purchase of a home using Homebuyer Assistance Program funds. Any individual who is a displaced homemaker may not be excluded because that individual, while a homemaker, previously owned a home with his or her former spouse. Any individual who is a single parent may not be excluded because that individual previously owned a home with his or her spouse. Definitions of "displaced homemaker" and "single- parent" are per 24 CFR 92.2. OH may narrow the definition of "first- time homebuyers" in order to ensure equitable treatment between married and non-married persons, subject to federal requirements in the case of loans using ADDI funds. OH also may, for the same purpose, expand the "single parent" eligibility category with respect to loans not using ADDI funds.

 * Borrowers must successfully complete a pre-purchase homebuyer education program approved by OH.

 * Borrowers must be able to financially qualify for a first mortgage approved by OH.

 * In programs administered directly by the City, qualifying income will be defined using the IRS definition of adjusted gross income for reporting on IRS Form 1040, subject to any adjustments or exclusions required by federal law or regulations. House Key Plus Seattle, a program administered for the City by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, will use the Section 8 Program definition for gross annual income.

 Lending Guidelines

 * Homebuyer assistance loans will be limited to the amount needed for each borrower, providing gap financing for low-income borrowers unable to qualify for sufficient private financing to purchase a home.

 * Borrowers may receive homebuyer assistance loans up to a maximum of $45,000 per assisted household, including both Levy funds and other City-administered funds, unless the maximum is increased in accordance with provisions below. Homebuyer assistance loans include loans to homebuyers and loans to developers or prior owners assumed by, or otherwise passed through to, homebuyers. Homebuyer assistance loans may be used for downpayments, closing costs, and/or first mortgage loan interest rate write down, as approved by OH. City-funded assistance for any home improvements, if committed or provided in connection with a home purchase, is considered to be assistance for the purchase and, together with the homebuyer assistance loan, cannot exceed the applicable loan limit except in the following cases: (1) assistance provided to a nonprofit developer for home purchase and improvement costs associated with an OH-approved land trust project, and (2) assistance to an eligible buyer purchasing a home located within a Housing Investment Area, for which the combined homebuyer and home improvement assistance may total up to $65,000, provided that the homebuyer assistance loan does not exceed $45,000.

 * In order that single-source downpayment assistance may be provided for the convenience of borrowers, in lieu of loans from Levy or other City funds and non-City sources to the same borrower, OH may allow a higher amount of City-funded home purchase assistance, not to exceed $70,000, for a borrower that receives a loan made as part of a project or lending program for which a developer or nonprofit lending agency has obtained commitments of non-City homebuyer subsidy funds, but only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

 (1) Non-City subsidy funds provided to such project or program must be used for deferred downpayment assistance loans or other assistance that increases the ability of low-income households to purchase a home.

 (2) The average amount of City-administered home purchase assistance for all low-income homebuyers participating in the project or lending program, including buyers who do not receive any City-administered funds, may not exceed $45,000.

 * The OH Director may revise the maximum loan amount of $45,000 by up to $10,000 for the homebuyer assistance if increases in interest rates or sales prices, or lack of other homebuyer subsidies, create difficulty in qualifying households with incomes up to 60% of median income as eligible homebuyers in Seattle. The OH Director must provide five working days notice to the Mayor and City Council if the loan amount is to be increased. The final decision of the OH Director will be made with responses from the Mayor and City Council taken into account. Council approval is required if the OH Director wants to increase the maximum loan amount by more than $10,000.

 * Homebuyer assistance loans using HOME funds, including ADDI funds, and using the recapture option will be structured with repayment obligations, using a promissory note and deed of trust approved by OH.

 * Loans will generally be 30-year amortizing loans, with payments deferred for the first 5 to 8 years. Loans may include provisions for payment of a share of appreciation. Any share of appreciation payable may be reduced and/or eliminated over time. Loan repayment terms shall specify the interest rate, which generally shall not exceed 3% simple interest; loan term; period of payment deferral; and any contingent interest or share of appreciation.

 * Borrowers must provide a minimum of $2,500 or 2% of the purchase price, whichever is greater, of their own funds toward the home purchase as a condition to any homebuyer assistance loan. Borrowers may receive gifts of funds towards their portion of the downpayment; however, gifts must not exceed 25% of the borrower's total downpayment requirement. Borrowers with incomes 60% of median income or less may provide a lower contributin as follows: (1) for borrowers who are participating in an Individual Development Account-type matching fund program, verified and approved by the Office of Housing, the minimum downpayment to be paide from the borrower's own funds, not including matching funds provided to the borrower, is $2,500; (2) for borrowers participating in an OH-approved nonprofit-sponsored sweat equity housing program that requires significant participation by the borrower, the borrower's contribution of volunteer time may be accepted in lieu of the minimum cash contribution; and (3) for borrowers who have a long-term disability and whose household income includes SSI or similar public income support, gifts may constitute up to 75% of the borrower's total downpayment requirement.

 * The terms of each loan made to a homebuyer shall provide that the entire principal balance is due upon sale or refinancing of the home, at the lender's option, to the extent permitted by applicable law. However, OH may permit assumption of the loan by another eligible borrower in lieu of repayment.

 * Borrowers may use any first mortgage product approved by OH, including FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac products, and portfolio loans. FHA 203(k) purchase-rehabilitation loans are also eligible, provided the rehabilitation amount exceeds $5,000.

 Recapture and Resale Guidelines

 The following provisions apply to HOME, including ADDI, homebuyer assistance funds.

 In conformity with HUD rules, OH will impose either resale or recapture requirements, at its option. The recapture or resale options may be managed by the City, a subrecipient, or other contracting party at OH's option. The recapture or resale options cannot be used together in the same loan.

 * For HOME funds that are allocated for eligible development costs and programs operated by nonprofit housing agencies, the resale option may be used. In such cases, the agreement with the developer or nonprofit housing agency will provide for long-term affordability of the housing. Requirements include:

 * The initial sale and any resale of subsidized units during the applicable affordability period must be made to low-income households.

 * The resale price during the applicable affordability period is limited to maintain an affordable purchase price for subsequent low- income homebuyers. The resale formula must also provide for a fair return to the seller. The resale price and return formula must be approved in advance by OH.

 * New purchaser income and resale price are restricted during the affordability period via a recorded deed restriction or land covenant, or there is a purchase option or right of first refusal in favor of the City or a City-approved entity at a restricted price, or both methods are used.

 * For HOME funds allocated to lending programs, the recapture option may be used. The City or a City-approved entity will have the right to require full repayment of the HOME subsidy, including ADDI funds, when resale occurs, regardless of the applicable affordability period, to the full extent permitted by law.

 Subordination Policy

 Many program borrowers refinance their homes or borrow against the value of their homes, and request that their homebuyer assistance loan's lien position be subordinated to another loan. In some cases agreeing to these subordination requests could greatly increase the risk that taxpayer funds may not be paid back. The current policy of OH is that subordination requests will be evaluated by the Homeownership Program Manager and will be considered only when all of the following conditions are met:

 * The total proposed loan to value ratio does not exceed 90% of the appraised or assessed value, whichever is less. The new loan does not have a balloon payment before the homebuyer assistance loan maturity date and is not an interest only loan.

 * The homeowner needs to refinance only the existing first mortgage indebtedness against the property to take advantage of better rates, terms, and payments, and is not incurring additional indebtedness against the property, except for one or more of the following:

 * Refinancing fees;

 * Payments needed in order to save the house from a foreclosure;

 * Costs of an urgent health and safety repair;

 * Medical, funeral, or other emergency expenses of the homeowner or immediate family that are determined to be allowable by the Homeownership Program Manager.

 Targeted Outreach

 OH has worked with the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA), local lenders, and the Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) to make City downpayment assistance funds available for residents and tenants of public housing and manufactured housing. SHA, through its Family Self-Sufficiency and Section 8 Homeownership programs, is marketing to residents and tenants of public housing and identifying eligible families for homeownership programs. The City will work with the WSHFC and participating lenders to identify tenants of manufactured housing in the City and mail program brochures to them. The City has made Levy, ADDI, and other HOME funds available for downpayment assistance. WSHFC is making below-market interest rate first mortgages available to eligible borrowers. Private mortgage lenders are originating and closing the mortgage loans.

 Homebuyer Education and Counseling

 All homebuyers using City downpayment assistance funds are required to attend homebuyer education. The City funds the HomeSight homebuyer education and counseling program with CDBG funds. In addition, the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) has contracted with the Urban League and the International District Housing Alliance to provide homebuyer education and counseling to residents and tenants of public housing who are planning to buy homes. SHA staff screen and determine the suitability of residents and tenants of public housing for participation in homebuyer programs.

 SHA and King County Housing Authority (KCHA) received ROSS Homeownership Counseling funding in a joint application in FY 2002. SHA and KCHA procured the services of an ethnically-diverse homeownership counseling and referral consortium. The consortium of the Urban League, El Centro de la Raza and International District Housing Alliance has begun culturally-specific outreach to qualified public housing tenants in Family Self-Sufficiency or similar programs to identify possible Section 8 homeownership recipients. The consortium also recruits and enrolls eligible households in homebuyer education workshops, works with participants on credit issues, prequalifies and connects them with lending programs and assists with housing search and other supportive services.

 HomeWise Program Policies

 OH's HomeWise Program provides for low-interest rehabilitation loans and weatherization grants primarily for the purpose of improving the health, safety, and energy efficiency of housing for low-income households. Income limits for rehabilitation loans vary by fund source, but in no case exceed 80% of MI. The maximum individual rehab loan is $45,000, with a waiver by the OH Director allowing up to $10,000 additional (for an overall total of $55,000) due to demonstrated health and safety needs. Interest rates generally are set at 3% simple interest. Depending on the circumstances of the individual household, the loan may be amortized or deferred. The program gives priority to loans for improving health and safety, and for curing code violations.

 Weatherization grants are made for energy efficiency-related repairs in owner- and renter- occupied single-family homes and eligible multi- family rental properties. The income limits for such grants vary by both fund source and tenure of the household (i.e. owner, renter).

 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance Policies

 The City administers two rental assistance programs. The Rental Stabilization Program is funded with HOME funds. The second program, called the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, is funded through the 2002 Seattle Housing Levy and is described in more detail in the Levy Administrative & Financial Plan.

 Under the Rental Stabilization Program, $205,947 of 2005 HOME funds are available for tenant-based rental assistance for families and individuals who are transitioning out of homelessness or who are at risk of becoming homeless. Up to eighteen months of transition and eviction prevention assistance is provided to eligible households. Additional non-HOME funding supplements the core rental assistance with case management services to address the special needs of those who have been or are at-risk of homelessness and to promote long-term stability for the households served. The program emphasizes client stabilization in housing six months after leaving the program. The Salvation Army is administering the program through a contract with the City.

 Population served: Only Seattle households and individuals with incomes at or below 50% of median income are eligible to apply for rental-assistance funds.

 Need: The need for rental assistance in Seattle is great. The three primary factors that demonstrate the need for tenant-based rental assistance funds are:

 * The increasing number of individuals who are homeless;

 * The "cost burden" or extent to which gross housing costs exceed 30% of gross household income; and

 * The number of households on the Seattle Housing Authority's waiting list for subsidized housing.

 Feasibility: Tenant-based rental assistance is feasible in Seattle where the housing stock is in good condition. Vacancy rates vary from neighborhood to neighborhood and indicate that rental housing is available.

 Consistency with the Consolidated Plan: Tenant-based rental assistance is used to assist households with incomes up to 50% of median income and who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. This is consistent with the Seattle Consolidated Plan priority to provide safe, habitable permanently affordable, rental housing primarily to very low-income Seattle renter households most in need.

 Both of Seattle's rental assistance programs were developed by the City in coordination with the Seattle Housing Authority and a diverse group of stakeholders who are experienced with rental subsidy and eviction prevention programs. The programs are an important element in the City's overall homelessness prevention and long-term stability strategy. The models emphasize flexibility to foster coordination with other homelessness prevention programs, as well as with other fund sources dedicated to rental assistance and eviction avoidance. Administration of the Rental Stabilization Program includes oversight of HUD-defined fair market rent/rent reasonableness, Housing Quality Standards (HQS) and lead-based paint inspections, processing of payments to landlords/tenants, and developing terms for rental assistance contracts.

 Tenant selection procedures: At least 50% of the households assisted each year qualify, or would qualify in the near future without tenant- based rental assistance, for one of the three federal preferences:

 * Households occupying substandard housing, including households that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless;

 * Households paying more than 50% of annual income for rent; or

 * Households that are involuntarily displaced.

 The remaining households selected to receive HOME funds meet the following criteria:

 * Households currently living in permanent housing but at risk of becoming homeless.

 Subsidy amounts: The City uses SHA published Voucher Payment Standard as the rent payment standard for units. The minimum tenant contribution toward the rent is $50 per month. The tenant shall pay any amount in excess of the Voucher Payment Standard.
