 B. On September 1, 2005, Owner submitted to the City of Seattle's Department of Planning and Development an application for a contract rezone to change the existing SF 7200/Lowrise 3 (L3) zoned lot to L3 multifamily residential. The purpose of the application is to allow the Property to be used for more intense multi-family residential development.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to 23.34.004, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from SF7200/L3 to L3:

 A. Future development shall be limited to the 6 unit, three story ground related townhouse structure shown in Master Use Permit #3002989, including the design, siting and uses as depicted in plans submitted to DPD and dated August 10, 2005, and as revised on February 10, 2006, March 14, 2006 and April 17, 2006;

 B. Curbs and sidewalks constructed to City of Seattle standards shall be constructed along the project right of way frontage.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone of the Property, as calculated by S.M.C. Section 23.76.060, is two (2) years from the effective date of this ordinance, unless, within the two (2) year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit, which permit is subsequently issued.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owner and the City; provided, such amendment shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner or its successor avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the previous SF 7200/L3 zoning.
