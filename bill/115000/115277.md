 SECOND AMENDMENT TO

 TALBOT HILL SUBSTATION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT

 This SECOND AMENDMENT TO TALBOT HILL SUBSTATION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT (this "Second Amendment") is made and entered into by and between Puget Sound Energy, Inc. ("Puget"), formerly known as Puget Sound Power & Light Company, and The City of Seattle, acting by and through its City Light Department ("City"). Puget and the City are each sometimes referred to in this Second Amendment as "Party;" Puget and the City are sometimes referred to together in this Second Amendment as "Parties."

RECITALS

 A. Puget owns and operates a 230-kV substation in south King County known as the Talbot Hill Substation.

 B. On May 23, 1977, the Parties entered into the Interconnection Agreement regarding the interconnection of the parties' respective 230-kV facilities at Puget's Talbot Hill Substation (as amended as of January 7, 2004, the "Interconnection Agreement").

 C. The Parties desire to further amend the Interconnection Agreement in order to transfer the ownership of the facilities and equipment that were originally installed by the City pursuant to Section 2.1 (including a 230-kV circuit breaker and two sets of 230-kV disconnect switches), some of which were subsequently replaced pursuant to the Letter Agreement dated March 28, 2005, from the City to Puget.

 Now, therefore, the Parties agree as follows:

 1. Section 4 of the Interconnection Agreement is deleted and the following is inserted in lieu thereof:

 Section 4. Ownership and Maintenance

 Ownership of any and all equipment and facilities installed under this Agreement shall be and remain in the installing party; provided, that immediately upon the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) of this Second Amendment and receipt by Puget of a payment in the amount of $15,000 from the City in consideration of the total cost of all future operation and maintenance costs associated with the City's facilities and equipment as described in Section 2.1, Puget shall assume ownership of such facilities and equipment and also shall assume all operation and maintenance responsibilities thereof for the term of this Agreement. Thereafter, the point of change of ownership shall be where the respective equipment of the parties interconnects at the dead end structure on the line bay for circuit breaker #341, and its replacement circuit breaker. The point of change of ownership may also be referred to as the point of interconnection.

 2. All of the provisions of the Interconnection Agreement, unless expressly modified by this Second Amendment, remain in full force and effect.

 3. This Second Amendment shall be effective at 2400 hours on the date on which this Second Amendment has, with respect to Puget, been approved, accepted for filing or otherwise permitted to become effective by FERC (the "Effective Date"); provided, that if FERC approves or accepts this Second Amendment for filing, or otherwise permits it to become effective with any change or new condition, the Effective Date shall be the date on which both Parties have agreed in writing to such change or new condition.
