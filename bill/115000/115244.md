 WHEREAS, RCW 35.32A.080 provides that unexpended and unencumbered appropriations for capital purposes automatically carry forward from each budget year to the next unless abandoned by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, appropriations for the City's Capital Improvement Program are readily identifiable as being capital in nature and therefore automatically carry forward without Council action; and

 WHEREAS, the City makes some appropriations for capital purposes that are not readily identifiable as capital appropriations because they are not for the Capital Improvement Program, but the City Council intends that those capital appropriations also carry forward as provided in RCW 35.32A.080; and
