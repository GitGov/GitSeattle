 Attachment: Exhibit A: The Families and Education Levy Implementation and Evaluation Plan

 May 18, 2005 version #12

 Exhibit A Families and Education Levy Implementation and Evaluation Plan

 Overview -

 This implementation and evaluation plan sets forth the criteria, measurable outcomes and methodology by which Families and Education Levy (FEL) programs will be selected and evaluated. The objectives of the Levy programs are set out in criteria and measurable outcomes described below. Targets will be used to measure the success of the Levy and to provide information for mid-course corrections.

 In summary, all FEL programs will be selected and evaluated using the Outcomes Funding framework developed by the Rensselaerville Institute to guide levy investments. In this approach the City is viewed as an investor and has defined three city-wide outcomes that should result from the investment of FEL proceeds:

 * School Readiness - as measured by a kindergarten readiness assessment and the first grade Developmental Reading Assessment

 * Academic Achievement and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap- as measured by the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) and second grade Developmental Reading Assessment

 * Dropout Reduction - as measured by the number of students who stay in school and graduate

 To achieve the above results, the City will set clear numeric targets for each FEL program and will define and track indicators that measure progress toward targets. These indicators include, but are not limited to:

 * Families attending parent/teacher conferences and other school events

 * Students progressing on-time to the next grade level

 * Students improving attendance

 * Reductions in student disciplinary actions

 * Three and four-year-olds who meet developmental standards

 * Trends in key health indicators that impact academic performance including chronic conditions, births to teens and immunizations

 The outcome funding framework includes the tracking and verification of results as the key tool of program evaluation. The City will consistently review progress toward targets and make mid-course corrections. Targets will be updated annually based on interim results.

 Levy funded programs will rely on approaches that have demonstrated success at achieving results. Evaluation of programs will verify results in two ways:

 1) Quality control and course correction. Periodic, in-depth analysis of Levy funded programs will be conducted to provide direction for course correction.

 2) Overall reporting of the Families and Education Levy results. Annual reports will be provided to the Mayor, City Council and citizens identifying services and the key results. Reports will identify progress on key indicators, and will be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, refugee/immigrant status, free and reduced lunch eligibility, English proficiency and school.

 Following are the criteria, measurable outcomes and methodology by which FEL programs will be selected and evaluated:

 Preschool and Early Childhood Education (Early Learning)

 Criteria:

 * High-quality preschool will be provided to a target group of low- income four-year-olds in southeast and southwest Seattle that will ready them for kindergarten and enhance their long-term school success.

 * Two Early Learning Networks (ELNs)-one in southeast and one in southwest Seattle-will align existing programs and outcomes, achieve greater gains for children and families than simply funding unconnected programs, and will provide a structure for multiple stakeholders to combine their resources to fund preschools and other Early Learning services, including:

 * Professional development for preschool and child care teachers in southeast and southwest Seattle to improve their ability to prepare young children for kindergarten

 * Subsidies for some children in ELN preschools to provide full-day services

 * Services to parents, schools and community organizations to assist children from the ELN neighborhoods in making successful transitions to kindergarten

 * Home visits to low-income families with toddlers who are not in preschool programs, to build the families' skills in promoting literacy

 * Increased compensation for preschool staff in the southeast and southwest neighborhoods to reduce turnover and reward professional development

 * The southeast ELN in 2005/2006 is defined as neighborhoods east of Elliott Bay and the Duwamish that are south of I-90, and in 2006/2007 and for the remainder of the Levy term, the southeast ELN is defined as neighborhoods east of Elliot Bay and the Duwamish that are south of Madison Street. The southwest ELN is defined as neighborhoods (including Harbor Island) bounded by Elliott Bay on the north, the City's southern border on the south, the Duwamish on the east, and 35th Avenue SW on the west.

 Measurable Outcomes:

 Investments in Early Learning will contribute toward the city-wide targets for School Readiness and Academic Achievement and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap.

 Methodology:

 * Preschools will be selected through a competitive process and could be located in both schools and community-based organizations in southeast and southwest Seattle.

 * Preschools may co-enroll children served by other funds such as state or city child care subsidies, ECEAP, and/or private pay, to maximize the total number of children served, up to 700 each year.

 * Contractors will be required to use tested curricula, which will include embedded assessments of children's progress to be administered three times each year.

 * Data will drive course corrections: kindergarten readiness assessments conducted by the school district and curricula-linked assessments conducted by preschool teachers.

 Family Support and Family Involvement Services

 Criteria:

 * Family Support Workers (FSWs) will serve elementary and K-8 schools and will support academic achievement among high-need students:

 * FSWs will be part of a multidisciplinary team-composed of school staff and staff from community programs-that will identify those students at greatest academic risk.

 * FSWs will directly engage families to help students achieve academically and will, as needed, refer students and families to other community resources to meet basic needs.

 * The Family Partnership Program Coordinator will be funded by the Levy. This position was previously funded by the School District.

 * The remaining school-based Family Involvement funding will be distributed through a citywide competitive grant process available to all elementary and K-8 schools.

 * Schools that apply for school-based family involvement "SBFI" grants will describe goals for family involvement in their schools focused on high need populations and analyzed by ethnicity. The $250,000 of community-based funding will be awarded through a competitive process to organizations that serve high-need populations identified in the SBFI grants.

 * The City and District will jointly develop the grant process and allocation of community-based family involvement services.

 * If one program coordinator administers both the school-based and community-based program the cost of the program coordinator should be allocated to both programs.

 * School-based Family Involvement will assist schools to implement partnerships that involve families in their children's learning at school and at home, and improve academic achievement.

 * Community-based Family Involvement will build strong links among schools, community organizations, refugee/immigrant families and families of color to further academic achievement.

 Measurable Outcomes:

 Family Support and Family Involvement investments will contribute toward the city-wide targets for Academic Achievement and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap.

 Methodology:

 * The City and the Seattle School District will identify up to ten high-need elementary schools in southeast and southwest Seattle that will receive for the first year of the Levy, the most concentrated investment of FSWs with at least one FTE assigned to each school. All other schools will receive FSW services based on their level of need. All schools will have access to FSW services.

 * Family Involvement (school-based and community-based) will focus on research-driven activities that positively impact academic achievement.

 * Data will drive course corrections: academic achievement indicators, Direct Reading Assessments, and WASL scores.

 Middle School Support and Out-of-School Time Activities

 Criteria:

 * Middle School Support (MSS) programs will provide school-based services for middle school students during school hours.

 * MSS programs will provide mental health services, social/emotional counseling and truancy/dropout prevention and will use evidence-based interventions and treatment approaches to address truancy, substance abuse, behavior problems, and stressors such as death, divorce, anxiety and/or depression that negatively impact student achievement.

 * Out-of-school time programs will provide numerous services for students, and families, to improve academic achievement at four elementary and ten middle school Community Learning Center (CLC) sites that are school or community-based:

 * Using schools as a hub, CLCs will provide a comprehensive set of services, activities and learning experiences that are culturally relevant and tailored to the needs of students and families. They will include homework and tutoring support focused on math and literacy, English as a second language instruction, project-based learning, technology activities and numerous other developmentally appropriate learning opportunities.

 * CLCs will be modeled on best practices of after-school programs that have helped students achieved academically.

 * Out-of-school time activities at the selected sites will be coordinated by school teams to maximize learning by connecting to students' school day.

 * CLC programs will engage families and will provide community resource and referral information as well as parent and family activities during out-of-school time that promote academic achievement.

 * After-school activity programs (ASAP) will be provided at nine K-8 schools, which are not CLC sites.

 * FEL investments will also help support athletics programs for middle school youth.

 Measurable Outcomes:

 Investments in Middle School Support and Out-of-School Time will contribute toward the city-wide targets for Academic Achievement and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap.

 Methodology:

 * Out-of-School Time services will be delivered by community-based providers, selected through a competitive Request for Investment (RFI) process.

 * MSS services will be delivered by both school staff and community- based providers. Community-based providers will be selected through a competitive Request for Qualifications (RFQ) or Request for Investment (RFI) process.

 * Up to four high-need middle schools may be innovation sites for the coordination and implementation of multiple Levy-funded programs- including, where applicable, MSS, Out-of-School Time, Student Health and High Risk Youth. Instead of setting result targets for these schools by individual programs, they will have whole-school targets for the total FEL investment they receive.

 * Students will be identified and referred to the appropriate direct services and program participants' progress will be tracked.

 * Data will drive course corrections: academic achievement indicators and WASL scores.

 Support for High-Risk Middle and High School Age Youth (High-Risk Youth)

 Criteria:

 * Support for High Risk Youth will be provided through the Seattle Team for Youth (STFY) program, which provides case management to keep high-risk youth in school, or return them to school, and improve their academic achievement:

 * Case management services help youth navigate the school and court systems and access tutoring, mentoring, heath, mental health, employment, and drug and alcohol services.

 * The program brings together community-based organizations, with the Seattle Police Department and the Seattle Public Schools, to work collaboratively toward reducing the dropout rate, improving education outcomes and reducing juvenile delinquency.

 Measurable Outcomes:

 Investments in High Risk Youth will contribute toward the city-wide targets for Academic Achievement and Dropout Reduction and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap.

 Methodology:

 * The STFY program will contract with community-based organizations to achieve Academic Achievement and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap and Dropout Reduction targets through culturally appropriate case management for high risk students at schools with the highest dropout rates including Aki Kurose, Meany, Mercer, Denny, Madison,Cleveland, Franklin, Rainier Beach, Chief Sealth, West Seattle, Southlake, Marshall, and Interagency.

 * An increased presence in Seattle Public Schools and the school-based health centers will integrate case managers into school intervention teams, increase identification of students, and facilitate referrals and service planning.

 * Youth with risk factors for dropping out of school will be identified earlier and contractors will be expected to demonstrate how they will increase referrals from school personnel from 37% to a minimum of 50% of program participants.

 * Data will drive course corrections: academic achievement indicators, information on truancy and discipline, and WASL scores.

 Student Health Services

 Criteria:

 * Student health services will provide access to primary care for students in all regular high schools and selected middle schools:

 * The medical focus will be on reproductive health care, immunizations, well child care, and chronic conditions such as asthma.

 * Mental health counseling and services will be available for all students, including evidence-based evaluation and treatment of depression.

 * New interventions will focus on students most at risk of dropping out of school or transferring to alternative settings:

 * Screenings will aim for earliest possible identification of students at risk.

 * Interventions will identify students to provide the appropriate level of counseling, case management, and follow-up interventions.

 * FEL-supported school nurses will play leadership and planning roles in identifying schools' priorities in population-based, preventive services:

 * Nurses will screen for students at risk of dropping out.

 * Through broader participation in school-wide or neighborhood health campaigns, nurses will promote immunizations and well child care.

 Measurable Outcomes:

 Investments in Health Services will maintain access to primary care at all regular high schools and high-need middle schools and contribute toward the citywide targets for Academic Achievement and Reduction of the Academic Achievement Gap and Dropout Reduction.

 Methodology:

 * Health centers will align with other Levy investments to maximize mental health and behavioral counseling, case management, and follow- up interventions that support academic achievement and dropout reduction.

 * Health centers will collaborate with the District on more intentional screening to identify students at risk of dropping out.

 * School nurses will contribute more directly to improved academic results and population health.

 * Data will drive course corrections: health indicators, academic achievement indicators and WASL scores.
