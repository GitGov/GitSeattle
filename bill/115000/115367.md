 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to enforcement of Seattle Municipal Code Title 15, the Street and Sidewalk Use Code, expanding the list of violations of Title 15 to be enforced under the citation or criminal provisions set forth in Chapter 15.91, increasing penalties for the first citation, enhancing the penalty for peak period violations enforced under the provisions set forth in Chapter 15.90, amending Chapters 15.90 and 15.91 of the Seattle Municipal Code, and adopting a new Street Use Permit Fee Schedule.

 WHEREAS, the Director of Transportation is responsible for enforcing Title 15, the Street and Sidewalk Use Code; and

 WHEREAS, the authority to issue civil citations was granted to the Department of Transportation by Ordinance 120822 and has since proven to be an effective enforcement tool for those particular violations of Title 15 for which inspectors are able to issue civil citations; and

 WHEREAS, the Director has identified some additional enforcement responsibilities under Title 15 which are also one-time or short-term violations of the code, and thus it makes sense to enforce those through civil citations rather than the Notice of Violation and civil suit process set forth in Chapter 15.90; and

 WHEREAS, the current $150 fine for first time offenders under the citation provisions has proven to be ineffective in some cases in deterring people from violating the code, the Director of Transportation desires to increase the monetary penalties for first time citations; and

 WHEREAS, more than one major transportation project is planned for the City of Seattle in the near future and it is vital that the Director be able to deter persons from using the public right-of-way for non-transit related purposes during peak traffic periods; and

 WHEREAS, because the $500 per day penalty for violations prosecuted pursuant to SMC Chapter 15.90 is insufficient to deter some individuals from using the public right-of-way during peak traffic periods the Director seeks to impose a Peak Period Penalty Enhancement on those violators; and

 WHEREAS the City of Seattle Traffic Engineer prohibits work in the public right-of-way on arterial streets during peak hours, but the Department recognizes that such work must be done under certain circumstances; and

 WHEREAS the existing Street Use Permit Fee Schedule does not contemplate such use of the right-of-way during peak hours, a mobility impact surcharge is now created in order to permit such work when authorized by the City of Seattle Traffic Engineer; and

 WHEREAS the City of Seattle Traffic Engineer will implement an exception review process to allow those projects which may only be completed by working in the public right-of-way during peak hours; and

 WHEREAS, an earlier ordinance cited an erroneous section of the Revised Code of Washington for procedures for appellants to appeal the Hearing Examiner's decision on citations, which is the final decision of the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. SMC 15.91.002 is amended as follows:

 A. Violations of the following provisions of Seattle Municipal Code Title 15 shall be enforced under the citation or criminal provisions set forth in this Chapter 15.91 by the Director of Transportation:

 C. Peak Period Penalty Enhancement.
