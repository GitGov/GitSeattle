 AMENDMENT TO THE CONSERVATION FUTURES

 INTERLOCAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN KING COUNTY AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 FOR OPEN SPACE ACQUISITION PROJECTS

 Preamble

 The King County Council, through Ordinance 9128, has established a Conservation Futures Levy Fund and appropriated proceeds to King County, the City of Seattle and certain suburban cities through the procedures set forth in Ordinance 8867, as amended by Ordinance 13717. This Amendment is entered into to provide for the allocation of additional funds made available for open space acquisition.

 THIS AMENDMENT is entered into between the CITY OF SEATTLE and KING COUNTY, and amends and attaches to and is part thereof of the existing Interlocal Cooperation Agreement entered into between the parties on the 5th day of June, 1990, as previously amended.

 The parties agree to the following amendments:

 Amendment 1: Article 1. Recitals

 A paragraph is hereby added to the Recitals Section to provide for the 2003 Conservation Futures Levy Fund Allocation, and hereafter reads:

 "On November 24, 2003, the King County Council passed Ordinance 14797, which appropriated a total of Three Million Six Hundred Thirty-five Thousand Dollars ($3,635,000) in Conservation Futures Levy proceeds to the City of Seattle. On March 15, 2004 the King County Council passed Ordinance 14852, authorizing the King County Executive to enter into interlocal agreements with the City of Seattle and the suburban cities for the disbursement of Conservation Futures Funds in Ordinance 14797."

 Amendment 2: Article V. Conditions of Agreement

 Section 5.1 is amended to include Attachment R, which lists the 2003 Conservation Futures Levy Allocation to the City of Seattle for the Fremont Peak Park, SW Alaska Street, Greenwood Park, Kubota Gardens, Longfellow Creek/Puget Creek, Urban Center Parks (University District and Denny Triangle), West Capitol Hill Park, and Sylvan Way Open Space land acquisition projects.

 Amendment 3: Article VII. Responsibilities of County

 The first two sentences of this article are amended to include Attachment R, which lists the 2003 Conservation Futures Levy Allocation to the City of Seattle for the Fremont Peak Park, SW Alaska Street, Greenwood Park, Kubota Gardens, Longfellow Creek/Puget Creek, Urban Center Parks (University District and Denny Triangle), West Capitol Hill Park, and Sylvan Way Open Space land acquisition projects, and Article VII hereafter reads:

 "Subject to the terms of this agreement, the County will provide Conservation Futures Levy Funds in the amounts shown in Attachments A through R to be used for the Projects listed in Attachments A through R. The City may request additional funds; however, the County has no obligation to provide funds to the City for the Projects in excess of the total amounts shown in Attachments A through R. The County assumes no obligation for the future support of the Projects described herein except as expressly set forth in this agreement."

 In all other respects, the terms, conditions, duties and obligations of both parties shall remain the same as agreed to in the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement as previously amended.

 ALLOCATION

 Jurisdiction Project Allocation

 Seattle Fremont Peak Park $185,000 SW Alaska Street $170,000 Greenwood Park $100,000 Kubota Gardens $200,000 Longfellow Creek/Puget Creek $280,000 Urban Center Parks (University $1,900,000 District and Denny Triangle) $500,000 West Capitol Hill Park $300,000 Sylvan Way Open Space TOTAL $3,635,000

 This site is a 0.13 acre addition to Fremont Peak Park, located between 1st Avenue NW and Palatine Avenue at NW 45th Street. The property will allow better street visibility and access to this small local park, an urban refuge with outstanding views of the Lake Union Ship Canal, Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains and downtown Seattle.

 City of Seattle - SW Alaska Street $170,000

 This 0.5-acre green space is located on SW Alaska Street and 48th Avenue Southwest, just west of the West Seattle Junction Hub Urban Village.

 City of Seattle - Greenwood Park $100,000

 This project consists of two inholdings within Greenwood Park, located on Fremont Avenue at North 88th Street. Each of the inholding properties contains a house that will be removed.

 City of Seattle - Kubota Gardens $200,000

 Located off Renton Avenue South in the Rainier Beach Neighborhood, this project consists of two wooded inholding parcels totaling 5.6 acres that buffer Kubota Gardens. The gardens are a Seattle landmark with local and international cultural significance. The additions also provide additional urban wildlife habitat. The City plans a passive nature trail in this buffer and the project will also help protect the headwaters of Mapes Creek.

 City of Seattle - Longfellow Creek/Puget Creek $280,000

 This project consists of inholdings in ownership on two West Seattle creek systems. The Longfellow Creek portion consists of two parcels at the corner of 24th Avenue SW and SW Willow Street, and the Puget Creek Additions portion consists of two adjacent wooded parcels near SW Brandon Street and 21st Avenue SW. The Longfellow Creek portion contains two houses that will be removed, allowing for the riparian habitat in the corridor to be subsequently restored.

 City of Seattle - Urban Center Parks (University District & Denny Triangle) $1,900,000

 The project goal is to acquire one or more small green spaces in the highly urbanized Denny Triangle and University District neighborhoods in Seattle. The City has identified possible sites to meet these needs, but has not yet made a final selection. $1.9 million in total is tentatively allocated to both neighborhood greenspace projects combined, but Seattle must propose a specific site or sites for approval by King County before Conservation Futures funds are transferred to the project.

 City of Seattle - West Capitol Hill Park $500,000

 Located on Summit Avenue East at East John Street, and Olive Way, this proposed .22 acre open space is located in the high-density neighborhood in West Capitol Hill. The site is currently a parking lot that will be redeveloped and converted into a neighborhood greenspace.

 City of Seattle - Sylvan Way Open Space $300,000

 This project is a 3.4-acre wooded open space between Sylvan Way SW and SW Othello Street, at 27th Avenue SW, in the Delridge neighborhood. This project will provide additional urban wildlife habitat.
