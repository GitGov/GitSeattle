 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of Professional Accountability (OPA) Review Board; increasing the number of terms each OPA Review Board (OPARB) member may serve from two to three; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.28.905 accordingly.

 WHEREAS, the extensive training civilians must undergo in best law enforcement practices and criminal law and procedure represents an investment that is lost when experienced members must leave after just 4 years; and

 WHEREAS, OPARB members with greater experience and personal knowledge of stakeholders help bolster public acceptance and confidence; and

 WHEREAS, extending the OPARB members term limits to 3 two year terms or six years is consistent with the 2 three year term limit of six years of the OPA director; and
