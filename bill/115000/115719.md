 23.71.018 Transportation Management Program

 A. When substantial development is proposed which is expected to generate twenty-five (25) or more employee or student vehicle trips in any one (1) p.m. hour, the owner of the site upon which the substantial development is proposed shall prepare and implement a Transportation Management Program (TMP) consistent with requirements for TMPs in Director's Rule 14-2002.~~The TMP shall include measures likely to achieve the goals for the proportion of single occupant vehicle (SOV) trips identified below. These goals are a fifteen percent (15%) reduction in the proportion of SOV trips by 1995, twenty-five percent (25%) by 1997, and thirty-five percent (35%) by 1999, from the 1990 SOV baseline rate of eighty-five percent (85%) for commute trips made by all students and employees working in the Northgate area. (see Table 23.71.018A)~~

 1. For purposes of measuring attainment of ~~the~~ single-occupant vehicle (SOV) goalscontained in the TMP, the proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by employees and students at the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator). The proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated by dividing the total number of employees and students using an SOV to make a trip during the expected peak hour by the total number of employee and student person trips during the expected peak hour.

 2. Compliance with this section does not supplant the responsibility of any employer to comply with Seattle's Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Ordinance.

These goals are a ten percent (10%) reduction in the proportion of SOV trips by 1995, fifteen percent (15%) by 1997 and twenty percent (20%) by 1999, from the 1990 SOV baseline rate (sixty-nine percent (69%) SOV) for commute trips by all residents living in the Northgate area.
