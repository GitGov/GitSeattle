 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 1 of Ordinance 121740 is hereby amended to read as follows:

 The Mayor or Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed a Contract for Sale of Real Estate ("Agreement") with the Central Area Development Association (CADA), a Washington nonprofit corporation ("CADA") based on the form attached as Attachment A, with such additions, modifications and amendments as the Mayor or OED Director decide are necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, together with such ancillary and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Agreement shall provide for the transfer of the land legally described as:

 Parcel "40" - Lots 1 and 2, except the North 70 feet thereof and except the South 16 feet for alley, in Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington; and

 The South 36 feet of the North 70 feet of Lot 1 and the South 36 feet of the North 70 feet of the West 10 feet of Lot 2, in Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington;

 and

 Parcel "41" - Lots 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington

 (the "Property") to CADA, or an assignee permitted by the City, on the terms and subject to the conditions authorized in this ordinance. Consideration for the transfer of the Property shall be SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND and no/100 dollars ($750,000.00). The City Council determines that such amount, payable on the terms authorized herein, is adequate in light of the factors described in RCW 35.81.090. The Agreement shall provide that the Property shall be transferred subject to restrictions of record, and to development and use conditions that the City shall impose as a condition of the sale, which shall include, but not be limited to, substantially those described in Section 3 of this ordinance; provided, however, that because the Project will be constructed entirely on Parcel 41, the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City, to execute and deliver a release of said use covenants recorded against Parcel 40 conditioned on CADA's, or its assignee's, agreement that all proceeds from the sale of Parcel 40 shall be applied to development costs of the project. The Agreement shall provide for the consideration to be paid by applying the nonrefundable earnest money to be delivered to the City upon signing of the Agreement, and the balance according to the terms of a nonrecourse promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the Property. The promissory note shall be on the terms described in an exhibit to Attachment A, with such modifications and insertions as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance, and shall have a maturity date approximately 15 years from the anticipated date of completion of the improvements on the Property required by the Agreement, provided that the Mayor or OED Director may agree to a later maturity date if necessary to accommodate other financing.

 Section 2. Section 6 of Ordinance 121740 is hereby amended to read as follows:

 The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City, to lend and cause the disbursement to CADA, pursuant to the Loan Agreement authorized in Section 7 of this ordinance, of up to ~~SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($750,000)~~ ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY TWO DOLLARS ($1,204,992) of funds previously appropriated for the Community Equity Fund component of the Central Area Capital Fund Program ("Equity Fund"), which program was authorized in Ordinance 117729, as amended by Ordinance 119224. Such loan funds shall be used to finance the earnest money payment to the City required by the Agreement and other costs related to the proposed acquisition and redevelopment of the Property, including predevelopment costs. The loan shall be payable on the terms set forth in the form of promissory note attached as Attachment B to this ordinance, with such insertions and modifications as the Mayor or OED Director may determine are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance~~, and except that the Loan Agreement may provide that if the Agreement shall terminate without the Property having been conveyed to the purchaser, under circumstances in which the earnest money is retained by the City and there is no liability of either party, then an amount of the loan up to $450,500 may be forgiven~~. The maturity date of the loan shall be approximately 15 years from the anticipated date of completion of the improvements on the Property required by the Agreement, provided that the Mayor or OED Director may agree to a later maturity date if necessary to accommodate other financing. At any time prior to the maturity date and upon written request of CADA, up to $~~300,000~~ 754,992 of the loan amount ~~may~~ shall be forgiven provided that the principal amount has not previously become due; the redevelopment of the Property has been timely completed; at least 51% of residential units have been occupied by low- and moderate-income households, at least 8,000 net rental square feet have been maintained as a neighborhood commercial/retail center; CADA, or an entity in which CADA has a direct interest, remains the legal and equitable owner of the Property; and CADA remains in compliance with the terms of the Agreement and all other agreements with the City regarding the property. To the extent the loan terms and conditions described in this ordinance and in Attachment B hereto differ from those set forth in the policies for the Central Area Capital Fund adopted in Ordinance 117729, as amended by Ordinance 119224, the terms and conditions of this ordinance and Attachment B shall govern.

 Section 3. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to issue a non-recourse promissory note ("Note") in the principal amount not to exceed Two Million Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety Four Dollars ($2,398,794), based on the form attached as Exhibit C to this ordinance, and with such modifications, additions or amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Note shall provide for a schedule of maturities of principal approximately as stated in Exhibit A, with such modifications and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to lend and cause the disbursement of the Note proceeds to the 17th & Jackson Investment Fund LLC ("Obligor" or "NMTC Investment Fund"), or a substitute entity approved by the Mayor or OED Director. Obligor is an entity formed by Washington Mutual Community Development, Inc., as investor member, and ESIC Community Partners, Inc., as managing member, and such entity shall serve as the New Markets Tax Credit investment fund that will assist in financing development of the Property. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to cause there to be drawn from the federal treasury and deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, No. 17820, companion Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant funds in the amount of Four Hundred Seventy Nine Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty Nine Dollars ($479,759), and pursuant to the appropriation in Section 7 of this ordinance, to cause the disbursement of such amount for the benefit of Obligor, for the purposes of reducing debt service obligations on the loan, to provide loan loss reserves and to finance project costs associated with the Section 108 loan. The amount of such BEDI Grant funds is based on the ratio of the maximum amount of the Section 108 loan ($2,398,794) to the maximum proceeds of the City's Note (i.e., $10,000,000).

 Section 4. The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed: (1) a Loan Agreement with the Obligor based on the form attached as Exhibit B to this ordinance and the terms outlined in Attachment B to Exhibit B, with such adjustments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance; and (2) such amendments and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Section 108 loan shall be secured by an assignment and pledge for security purposes of the interest of Obligor in the CDE. As a condition of the 108 loan, the Loan Agreement shall require Obligor to cause the CDE to secure one or more deeds of trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED Director, against the Property.

 Section 5. The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to use the Equity Fund as additional security for the 108 loan, in an amount up to $1,800,000. The OED Director shall have the discretion to release such security when the OED Director has determined that the 17th and Jackson project has completed construction and has achieved sufficient lease-up to meet stabilized vacancy levels (i.e., 5% vacancy for residential space and 10% vacancy for commercial/retail space). Appropriation is authorized from the Equity Fund as follows, and unspent funds so appropriated shall carry forward to subsequent fiscal years until the OED has determined that conditions of Section 5 of this ordinance have been met, or such funds are otherwise exhausted or abandoned by ordinance:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 Section 8. The Mayor or OED Director may require the Obligor to pay a loan origination fee of no more than one percent (1%) of the loan amount, i.e., no more than Twenty Three Thousand Nine Hundred Eighty Seven Dollars ($23,987). The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of this fee to pay the National Development Council for consulting services related to the loans authorized hereby, in accordance with the City's existing contract with the National Development Council, and to pay for the City's legal fees and any other costs related to the issuance and placement of the Note and the administration of the transactions authorized by this Ordinance, that are not paid by Obligors pursuant to loan agreements. The OED Director is authorized to cause any remaining portion of such fee to be applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally guaranteed or federally funded economic development loan or program administered by the OED Director or to be remitted to the City and deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund.

 Section 9. The Director of the Human Services Department ("HSD Director") is authorized to further amend the City's 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and provide OED with technical assistance to ensure compliance with Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") regulations applicable to the Section 108 loan program. The Mayor, OED Director, and the HSD Director are authorized to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement the actions authorized by this Ordinance.

 Section 10. This Ordinance is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, any contractual or otherwise binding obligation upon, or commitment by, the City for the benefit of Washington Mutual, CADA, or any other party interested in the acquisition or development of the Property. The commitments authorized by this Ordinance, subject to the limitations herein and under applicable law, shall become effective only if and when the agreements authorized hereby are duly executed and delivered by the City and other necessary parties.

 Section 11. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed. If any provision of this ordinance is determined to be invalid or unenforceable the remainder shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect.

 Section 12. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 4.5 Loan Repayment Account.

 (a) Monthly Deposits. Commencing in the first month disbursement of principal of the City Note in respect of the Obligor Note is to be made, Obligor shall make monthly installment payments to the Custodian for deposit in an account maintained by the Custodian for the accumulation of funds for payments on the Obligor Note (the "Loan Repayment Account," established under the Custodial Agreement and Letter Agreements), in order that the Custodian shall have sufficient funds to pay installments on the Obligor Note as they come due (each such due date being an "Obligor Note Payment Date"). Obligor shall pay to the Custodian on each Deposit Day, the Interest Component and the Principal Component, each for deposit into the Loan Repayment Account. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account shall be used to make payments on the City Note as they come due. Each such monthly deposit shall be due and payable, in immediately available funds, on the "Deposit Day," which shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of the month, or if such day is not a Business Day, then on the previous Business Day; subject to adjustment in respect of any Conversion Date. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b) hereof, the Interest Component payable each month shall be in an amount equal to the interest accrued and to accrue on the Obligor Note during that entire calendar month, except that the Interest Component shall be adjusted ratably in any month the Loan is not outstanding for the entire month. Each Principal Component shall be one-twelfth (1/12th) of the total principal coming due on the Obligor Note on the next Obligor Note Payment Date on which principal shall become due, except that (i) the Principal Component on each Deposit Day during the period from the date hereof to the first such Obligor Note Payment Date shall be the principal amount then falling due divided by the number of Deposit Days scheduled to occur during such period; and (ii) the Principal Component for each Deposit Day after July 15, 2026 shall be limited (but not reduced below zero) so that the total of

 the Principal Component and Interest Component does not exceed the total of such amounts required on the last Deposit Day falling on or before July 15, 2026. Except as provided in Section 4.5(b) below, Obligor shall not be entitled to any reductions in, or credits against, deposits to the Loan Repayment Account based upon interest or earnings credited to the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account or the BEDI Grant Reserve Account. The Obligor hereby irrevocably assigns all of its right, title and interest, if any, in funds deposited in the subaccounts of the Loan Repayment Account, Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account related to the Obligor Note, to the Custodian and the City, and shall have no residual interest in any portion of such Reserves.

 (b) Interest Subsidy. The City agrees that funds in the amount of One Hundred Forty-Two Thousand Three Hundred Twenty Three Dollars ($142,323), derived solely from a BEDI Grant, shall be used to pay interest first coming due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. Each such payment of interest shall constitute a grant to the Obligor when the funds are applied to payment on the Obligor Note under Section 4.5(c). Obligor shall not be required to deposit an Interest Component until the month before the month in which the cumulative interest accruing on the Corresponding Portion shall exceed the amount set forth above in this subsection (b).

 (c) Transfers Authorized; Crediting Payments on Obligor Note . The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to transfer from the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the Loan Repayment Account on each Obligor Note Payment Date, funds in the full amount due on the Obligor Note on each such date, and so long as no Interest Component is required from the Obligor, to transfer from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, the amount of the Interest Component that

 would be required from the Obligor but for the terms of Section 4.5(b). The Custodian is then authorized and directed to apply funds in the Loan Repayment Account to the timely payment of amounts due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Obligor further agrees that upon direction of the City, the Custodian may apply funds in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to make any payments on the Corresponding Portion for which there are insufficient funds in the Loan Repayment Account as a result of failure by Obligor to pay funds to the Custodian for deposit therein as required hereunder, but no application of any funds in any account to payments on the Obligor Note shall waive or reduce any such required payments from Obligor. Obligor's monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account shall not constitute payments under the Obligor Note. Obligor shall be credited with the payment of interest and principal on the Obligor Note only when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit and/or transferred to the Loan Repayment Account under this Section 4.5(c), not including any amounts in the Loan Loss Reserve, are applied to the payment of the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, except that if all amounts necessary to pay all amounts owing on the Obligor Note are on deposit in the Loan Repayment Account on the final maturity date of the Obligor Note, such amounts shall be credited on such maturity date. The Custodian is further irrevocably authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments in the Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account, in the Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any loss on any such liquidation, for the purposes described in this Section 4.5(c). The authorization by Obligor in this Section 4.5(c) is in addition to, and not in limitation of, the authorization in Section 1.4 above.

 (d) Investment of Funds; Earnings Remain on Deposit. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall be invested at the direction of City, but only in instruments that mature (or are redeemable without penalty) within six (6) months and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days before the next Obligor Note Payment Date, and that are guaranteed as to payment of principal by the United States Government, or in money market funds that invest solely in such instruments. All earnings in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall remain therein until applied in accordance with this Agreement, or until all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, or in the case of the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, until any earlier date when any right of the Obligor to have amounts in such Account applied for its

 benefit shall have terminated hereunder. When all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, then the remaining balance shall be disbursed to or upon the order of the City.

 (e) Late Charge. If any deposit required to be made into the Loan Repayment Account is not received within ten (10) days after the date when such deposit is due, in addition to additional interest required to be paid in accordance with the Obligor Note, Obligor agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5.0%) of the amount past due, as compensation to the City and Custodian for the staff time and resources required to handle such delinquencies, and not as a penalty. Such late charges shall not be credited to the Loan Repayment Account, but shall be retained by the City and/or Custodian. Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.

 4.6 Application of Payments. Any amounts to be applied to the Obligor Note in accordance with this Agreement shall be applied first to accrued interest on the Obligor Note, next to any premium then due, and the balance, if any, to reduction of principal.

ARTICLE V - OBLIGOR'S LOAN COVENANTS

 In addition to other obligations of the Obligor hereunder, Obligor covenants and agrees as follows:

 5.1 General. From and after the date hereof and so long as any amount remains unpaid on the Obligor Note, or for so long as any commitment exists to extend credit hereunder, Obligor covenants and agrees that it will:

 (a) Promptly pay principal, interest and premium (if any) pursuant to the Obligor Note as and when the same becomes due and payable, and make any and all other payments and deposits required by the Loan Documents;

 (c) Maintain and preserve the Collateral, and from and after ___________, 2014, maintain, preserve and keep the Property, improvements thereon, and all equipment used in connection therewith in good repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and from time to time make all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements and additions thereto so that at all times the efficiency thereof shall be fully preserved and maintained.

 5.2 Commencement and Completion of Construction. Permanent certificates of occupancy for all space in the rehabilitated buildings on the Property shall be obtained no later than December 31, 2008.

 5.3 Compliance with Laws. Conduct its business affairs in a reasonable and prudent manner and in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and executive orders of federal, state, county or municipal governments or agencies now in force or which may be enacted hereafter. From and after __________, 2014, all use and operation of the Property and Project, and all work performed in connection with the Property and Project shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and executive orders of federal, state, county or municipal governments or agencies now in force or which may be enacted hereafter.

 5.4 Inspections. Permit the City and its representatives at any reasonable time to inspect any and all Collateral and Obligor's other properties and to examine or audit Obligor's books, accounts, and records and to make copies and memoranda of Obligor's books, accounts and records. From and after __________, 2014, City and its representatives shall have the right, subject to the rights of tenants on the Property, at all reasonable times after three (3) days' prior written notice during regular business hours (and at any time in the event of an emergency) to enter upon the Property and inspect the Property to determine that the same is in conformity with this Agreement and all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. City shall have the further right, from time to time, to inspect and copy Obligor's books and records relating to the Property. Without limiting the foregoing, Obligor shall permit City to examine and copy all books, records and other papers relating to Obligor's use of the Loan proceeds and to Obligor's compliance with this Agreement, the Act and applicable provisions of federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

 5.5 Notify City of Litigation or Complaints.

 5.7 Federal Regulations. Obligor acknowledges that the Loan is to be made with funds received by the Custodian under the Section 108 program of the Act and that such funds are subject to CDBG program regulations of HUD, and certain other federal laws and regulations. Accordingly, Obligor agrees, represents and warrants that Obligor shall comply with all applicable requirements under HUD regulations for the CDBG program and under other laws and regulations applicable to loans of such federal funds, including without limitation those cited in this Section 5.7, and shall comply with all of the provisions below, some of which extend beyond federal requirements:

 (a) Benefit to Low- and Moderate Income Individuals. Loan funds shall be used for acquisition, after rehabilitation, of the Property. Use of funds shall satisfy the CDBG national objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income individuals (as defined by HUD for CDBG purposes) and the eligible activity criteria of acquisition under 24 CFR 570.703(a).

 For a twenty (20) year period following the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the residential units of the Project shall be rented to and occupied by households with incomes at or below eighty (80%) percent of Median Income at rents affordable to households with incomes at 80% of Median Income. Rents shall be considered affordable to such households if the total monthly rent, plus a reasonable allowance approved by the City for any utilities to be paid by the tenant, does not exceed one-twelfth of thirty percent (30%) of 70% of Median Income for a presumed family size based on the size of unit, as follows: studio --one person; one-bedroom, 1.5 persons; two bedrooms 3 persons; three bedrooms 4.5 persons; four bedrooms 6 persons. Where the presumed family size is not an integer, the average of the income limits for the next higher and lower integral family sizes will be used. Obligor shall use the definition of annual income set forth in subsection (1) (i) in the definition of "income" under 24 CFR 570.3. "Median Income" means annual median family income, as published from time to time by HUD, for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, or for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Division of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area, whichever is then generally used by HUD to establish income limits for federal programs, or such other area including Seattle as HUD may use from time to time for the purpose of publishing median income, and as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing. If, at any time, Median Income for a household size cannot be determined under the foregoing sentence based on data published by HUD for the Seattle area within the most recent thirteen months, then the City may determine "Median Income" for such household size based on any data for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion, adjusted for household size in such manner as the City shall determine in its sole discretion.

 The Project shall also result in the creation of at least twelve (12) new permanent jobs (full-time equivalent) at the Property. The Project is located in a census block group having a poverty rate of at least 20% and is not located within the City's central business district. As such, all jobs created for the Project will be presumed to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, pursuant to Section 570.208(a)(4)(iv) and (v).

 (b) Nondiscrimination. No person shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with CDBG funds. Obligor shall comply fully with all requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d etseq., which provides that no person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; and with Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") regulations implementing such requirements, 24 C.F.R. Part 1.

 Obligor shall comply with all of the requirements and prohibitions of 24 C.F.R. Section 570.602, implementing the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended; those of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations at 28 C.F.R. Parts 35 and 36 thereunder; those of HUD regulations under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. Section 6101 et seq., at 24 C.F.R. Part 146; and those of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Section 794), and implementing regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 8. Obligor shall include, in any instrument effecting or recording any transfer of its interest in the Property, the covenant required by 24 C.F.R. Section 8.50 with regard to compliance with regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

 Obligor shall ensure compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled "Equal Opportunity", as amended, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, 41 C.F.R. Part 60, which provide that no person shall be discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in all phases of employment during the performance of federal contracts and subcontracts, and Obligor shall take affirmative action to ensure fair treatment in employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation and selection for training or apprenticeship. The "equal opportunity clause" set forth in 41 C.F.R. Section 60-1.4(a) is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth, with Obligor as "Contractor" thereunder. Obligor shall cause the appropriate "equal opportunity clause" to be set forth in each "federally assisted construction contract" (as defined in 41 CFR Section 60-1.3, including subcontracts) for the Project, except as expressly exempted under 41 C.F.R. Part 60.

 No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

 (c) Conflict of Interest. Obligor shall ensure compliance with the provisions of 24 CFR Section 570.611, which provide generally that no officer, agent, employee, consultant or elected or appointed official of The City of Seattle, or of a designated public agency, or of any subrecipient receiving CDBG funds, who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted by CDBG funds or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with respect to these activities, shall obtain any financial interest or benefit from, or have any financial interest in, the activity funded under this Loan Agreement or any contract or subcontract or

 agreement with respect thereto or the proceeds thereof, for himself or herself or those with whom he or she has business or immediate family ties; nor shall (s)he for one year after completion of his or her tenure with the City or such subrecipient obtain or have any such financial interest or benefit. Obligor shall incorporate in all such contracts or subcontracts a provision prohibiting any conflict of interest prohibited by this subsection.

 (d) Debarred Contractors. No portion of the Loan shall be used directly or indirectly to employ, award contracts to, or otherwise engage the services of, or fund, any contractor or subrecipient during any period of debarment, suspension, or placement in ineligibility status of such contractor or subrecipient under the provisions of 24 C.F.R. Part 24. Obligor represents and warrants that neither Obligor nor its principals is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in federal assistance programs under such regulations or Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension." Obligor shall obtain, and shall require contractors and subcontractors to obtain, the certification required by appendix B of 24 CFR part 24 from each prospective contractor or subcontractor on the Project.

 (e) Lobbying. Obligor hereby certifies and agrees as follows, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Section 1352, to the best of its knowledge and belief:

 (1) No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of Obligor, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an

 employee of a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement;

 (2) If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with this Federal loan, it will complete and submit Standard Form-LLL, "Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying," in accordance with its instructions; and

 (3) It will require that the language of this Section be included in the award documents for subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly.

 This certification is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was made or entered into. Submission of this certification is made a prerequisite for making or entering into this transaction by section 1352, title 31, U. S. Code. Any person who fails to file the required certification shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

 (f) Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Obligor shall comply with any and all applicable requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and related acts. These requirements include, but are not limited to: language within each contract for construction work; payment of prevailing wages and fringe benefits; the submittal of various documents as evidence of compliance; withholding of funds; equal employment opportunity; and work hours.

 The requirements are defined in the: Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 276(a) et seq.; Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 328 et seq.; Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback Act), 18 U.S.C. Section 874; the Fair Labor Standards Act, and regulations under such Acts, including 29 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 5. If under other applicable law or any other agreement with respect to the Project, minimum levels of wages or benefits are required, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with such levels, and if both Davis-Bacon Act requirements and any other such requirements shall apply, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with higher of the applicable levels.

 (g) Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons. Obligor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with any and all applicable provisions of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u, the purpose of which is to ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. Obligor shall comply, and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable provisions of regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Secretary of HUD and set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 135, and with all applicable rules and orders of HUD issued thereunder.

 (h) Relocation and Acquisition. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that no residential tenants have been or will be displaced in connection with the Project and the Obligor has taken and shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) in connection with the Project. If the Obligor or its affiliate has acquired or entered into an agreement to acquire real property for the Project, then Obligor represents and warrants that prior to making an offer for such property, (1) Obligor or such affiliate clearly advised the owner in writing that it lacked the power of eminent domain and therefore was unable to acquire the property in the event negotiations failed to reach an amicable agreement, and (2) it informed the owner in writing of what Obligor or such affiliate believed to be the fair market value of the property. Obligor represents and warrants that Obligor has provided to City a complete and accurate list of all occupants of the Property as of the date that Obligor obtained site control, and Obligor shall provide a complete and accurate list of all persons occupying the Property at any time after site control and through the date of full occupancy after Project completion. Obligor shall comply fully, at Obligor's sole expense, with the City's Residential Anti-displacement and Relocation Assistance Plan ("RARAP"). If the Project involves the temporary and/or permanent displacement of persons, Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that Obligor has provided and shall provide, at a minimum, all relocation assistance required by 24 CFR Section 42; the federal Uniform Relocation Act and regulations thereunder, 49 CFR Part 24; 24 CFR Section 570.606 and any other applicable federal laws or regulations, and shall maintain complete and accurate records demonstrating such compliance. Obligor agrees that any determination by City of the amount of relocation assistance due to any person shall be final and binding upon Obligor, unless a different determination is made by HUD at the request of such person, in which case the HUD determination shall be final and binding on Obligor. Obligor agrees that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any payment by the City for such person shall, at City's option, constitute an advance on the Loan, without any requirement for a draw request by, or consent of, Obligor. If, as a result of any such direct payments, the amount advanced by City shall exceed the maximum Loan amount stated herein, then the excess shall be immediately due and payable by Obligor to City, at City's demand. Obligor represents and warrants that, except as expressly stated in a relocation plan submitted by Obligor to City in connection with this Loan, no residential tenants have been required to vacate or will be required to vacate the Property permanently because of the Project. Obligor shall carry out the terms of any relocation plan approved by City, but the terms of any such plan shall not limit Obligor's obligations under this Loan Agreement or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.

 (i) Architectural Barriers. Obligor shall ensure that the Property, upon completion of the Project, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (see 42 U.S.C. Sections 4151-57), and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).

 (j) Flood Insurance Protection. If the Property is in a special flood hazard area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, then Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that flood insurance is and shall remain in effect, at Obligor's expense, in accordance with Section 102(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001), so long as any amount is outstanding on the Obligor Note.

 (k) Records. Obligor shall maintain and make available to the City and HUD all records reasonably required to demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of this Agreement, for at least four (4) years after full repayment of the Loan.

 (l) Disclosures. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that it has provided to the City any and all disclosures required by the HUD Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3545, and regulations thereunder, 24 CFR Part 4; that it will provide timely updated disclosures to OH to the extent required by such act and regulations; and that all such disclosures are and shall be complete and accurate.

 (m) Prior Actions. Obligor represents and warrants that in all actions related to the Project to date Obligor and each of its affiliates involved in the acquisition of the property, each has complied with all requirements referred to in this Section 5.7.

 (n) Indemnity. Obligor shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand resulting from Obligor's failure to comply with any federal requirement to be complied with pursuant to this Agreement or failure to maintain adequate records to demonstrate such compliance. This provision

 shall survive expiration of this Agreement.

 5.8 Reports. Obligor shall deliver to the City reports and information as City may require for purposes of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Obligor, which may include copies of tenant certifications, rent rolls, leases, property management agreements and any other contracts affecting the Property.

 5.9 Liens or Claims of Liens. Obligor shall keep the Collateral free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, except for those permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 above. From and after ___________, 2014, Obligor shall keep the Property free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, except for those permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 above. If any claims of lien shall be asserted against the Collateral or the Property other than as permitted by this Section, Obligor, regardless of any action that City may otherwise be authorized to take, shall obtain a release and satisfaction of such lien claim, bond the lien claim, procure title insurance satisfactory to City protecting City from any loss relating to such lien claim, or otherwise provide to City assurances and security satisfactory to City that the lien claim will be paid or satisfied not later than ten (10) days after a judgment on the lien claim. Provided Obligor complies with the previous sentence, Obligor may in good faith contest any worker's or material supplier's lien in legal proceedings that will prevent enforcement of the lien claim and prevent foreclosure of the Property. If such a lien claim is not released or satisfied or a bond or other security satisfactory to City provided within forty-five (45) days of written request from City to Obligor, then the failure to do so shall allow the City to declare an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6.1 below).

 Nothing in this Section shall be construed to imply that property of a public corporation may be subject to a statutory mechanic's or materialmen's lien or other involuntary lien, nor be construed as consent by Obligor or the City to any such lien.

 5.10 Political Activity. No portion of the Loan shall be used for any political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 5.11 Further Actions. Obligor will at any time and from time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents, opinions, or other instruments or obtain such additional insurance as City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or county regulatory agency.

 5.12 Other Agreements. Obligor shall fully comply in a timely manner with all other agreements for the financing of the Project, including without limitation construction loans, bridge loans, and equity investment contracts ("Other Agreements"), and to the extent that any Other Agreements are the obligations of one of the Owners, the Obligor shall ensure that the Owner complies in a timely manner with the terms thereof, but nothing in this Section shall be construed to waive, or excuse noncompliance with, and provisions of this Agreement or any applicable City ordinances or permits. Obligor shall timely satisfy, and shall ensure that each Owner timely satisfies, all conditions under any Other Agreements to the receipt of funding for the Project and for qualification for historic rehabilitation tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code.

 5.13 Payment of Compensation of Custodian. Obligor shall be responsible for and pay its pro rata portion of the fees of the Custodian as provided under the Custodial Agreement. The Custodian's acceptance fee, prorated first annual fee and counsel fees and expenses shall be disbursed to Custodian from the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account at the time of initial Loan disbursement. Thereafter, Obligor shall promptly pay the Custodian's fees and expenses directly to the Custodian.

 5.14 Payment of Other Indebtedness. Obligor shall timely pay the principal, interest and all other amounts due on any other indebtedness or liability now or hereafter owing by the Obligor to any person and secured by the Property; provided, that nothing in this Section shall authorize Obligor to make any payment from any funds or assets pledged to the City hereunder.

 5.15 Transfer of Property. Obligor shall not cause or permit any transfer of the Collateral or any interest of Obligor therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent of the City. Obligor shall not cause or permit any transfer of the Property or any interest of Obligor therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent of the City, except for the creation of liens, encumbrances or leases that are expressly permitted under the Loan Documents without the City's consent.

ARTICLE VI - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 6.1 Events of Default. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events and prior to the complete cure thereof by Obligor in a manner satisfactory to the City, the City shall have the right to declare an Event of Default hereunder, without notice or demand by City, except as expressly provided in this Section:

 (a) Any failure to pay when due any deposit into the Loan Repayment Account in respect of principal or interest on the Obligor Note;

 (b) Any failure to make a payment or deposit of money required by any of the Loan Documents, other than amounts referred to in Section 6.1(a) above, that is not cured within ten (10) days of the due date of such payment or deposit (or within ten (10) days of demand in case of amounts due on demand);

 (e) Any breach or nonperformance by Obligor of any provision of any of the Loan Documents not included within any of Subsections (a)- (d) above that is not cured within sixty (60) days after notice to Obligor of such breach or nonperformance, or such longer cure period as may be permitted under the specific terms of the Loan Document; provided, however, that unless HUD shall otherwise require, if (1) such breach or nonperformance is susceptible to cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such cure period, (2) Obligor shall commence to cure such breach or nonperformance within such cure period and shall thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceed to cure the same, and (3) Obligor shall inform the City in writing of the status of the cure at the expiration of such cure period and every thirty days thereafter, then such cure period may be extended in the sole discretion of the OED Director for such time as the OED Director determines is reasonably necessary for Obligor to cure such breach or nonperformance;

 (f) A petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or for a receiver or trustee for any of Obligor's property is filed by Obligor, or is filed against Obligor and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or if Obligor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or any attachment or execution is levied against a substantial portion of the property of Obligor and is not discharged within ninety (90) days, or if any law or court order shall require the City, Custodian or any other party to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount paid under the Obligor Note or this Agreement as a preference or for any other reason except refund of duplicative payment;

 (g) Any representation, warranty or disclosure made to City by Obligor, or contained in any information submitted by Obligor to City or to any government agency in connection with the Loan or the Property, proves to be materially false or misleading as of the date when made or reaffirmed, whether or not such representation or disclosure appears in this Agreement; and

 (h) Any default by Obligor of its obligations under the Certificate and Indemnity, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure provisions thereunder.

 6.2 Declaration of Event of Default. City's declaration of an Event of Default hereunder shall be made by notice to Obligor pursuant to Section 7.15 of this Agreement and shall be effective as provided therein.

 6.3 Remedies.

 (a) Upon declaring an Event of Default, City may, in addition to any other remedies which City may have hereunder or under the Loan Documents or by law, at its option and without prior demand or notice take any or all of the following actions:

 (1) Immediately terminate any further advances of Loan funds hereunder and revoke any instructions to any third party holding any such funds;

 (2) Declare the Loan immediately due and payable in full;

 (3) Beginning on and after ___________, 2014, demand foreclosure under the Deed of Trust held by the CDE, judicially or nonjudicially;

 (8) Seek judicial appointment of a receiver.

 (b) All remedies of City provided for herein and in any other Loan Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law. The exercise of any right or remedy by City hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default, or prejudice City in the exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless, in the exercise of said rights, City realizes all amounts owed to it under such Loan Documents.

 6.4 No Default Prior to Declaration. No default or Event of Default shall exist under this Agreement or the Obligor Note until the same shall have been declared by the City or other party authorized to make such declaration; provided, that failure to declare, or delay in declaring, a default hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies or excuse any failure by Obligor to strictly comply with its obligations under all of the Loan Documents.

ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any noncompliance or breach by Obligor hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such noncompliance or breach, and no express waiver shall affect any breach or noncompliance other than as specified in the waiver. Any waiver shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or of, any act by Obligor requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Delegation to Custodian; Changes in Custodian and Custodial Agreement. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of City, HUD, and Obligor, their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder. The terms hereof shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Obligor's interest hereunder cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of City. Obligor acknowledges and agrees that City may assign to HUD or any custodian or trustee for HUD any or all of City's rights under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents and may direct that any payment or performance be provided directly to HUD or such custodian or trustee, whether or not the Obligor Note or this Agreement have been assigned. Obligor agrees that City may delegate to the Custodian the right to make demands and give directions on behalf of City under the Loan Documents, but that the scope of any such delegation shall be strictly limited to the terms of a written instrument duly signed on behalf of the City. Obligor further acknowledges that the Custodial Agreement may be modified or terminated, or a substitute Custodial Agreement executed, or a successor Custodian appointed, in each case without the consent of Obligor so long as the obligations of Obligor are not increased and the rights of the Obligor under the Loan Documents are not adversely affected in any material respect. Except for minor modifications to the Custodial Agreement not affecting Obligor, City agrees to give reasonable advance notice to the Obligor of any action as described in the preceding sentence, and agrees in each case to provide a copy of any modification or substitute Custodial Agreement to Obligor within fifteen (15) days after the execution thereof.

 7.3 No Defense Based on City Regulatory Actions. Obligor understands that (a) the operations of Obligor in the Property and elsewhere are subject to numerous laws, regulations, ordinances and permits, including those of City and other governmental bodies relating to land use, environmental hazards, and other regulatory matters, and (b) the modification, interpretation, application, or revocation of such laws, regulations, rules or permits could adversely affect economic return to Obligor from the Property. Obligor has conducted its own investigation and relied on the advice of its own counsel and experts as to all such matters in connection with Obligor's acquisition of the Property. Obligor acknowledges that by entering into this Agreement the City does not make, and that the City expressly disclaims, any representation or assurance whatever as to (1) the present or future status of the Property or the uses thereof under applicable laws or regulations, including those of the City; or (2) the availability, issuance or continuation of any permits, approvals, or interpretations of any kind that may be required or desired by Obligor or any other party in connection with the Property. Obligor agrees that notwithstanding any regulatory

 action or omission of City affecting Obligor or affecting the use or development of the Property (whether or not such action or omission shall be determined to be consistent with applicable law in any proceeding), no defense, offset or reduction of liability shall be available to Obligor, at law or in equity.

 7.4 Time. Time is of the essence of all provisions of the Loan Documents.

 7.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments.

 Seattle, Washington $2,398,794.00

, 2007

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, 17th & Jackson Investment Fund LLC ("Obligor"), a Washington limited liability company, promises to pay to THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Payee"), a Washington municipal corporation, or order, at the time or times provided herein, in lawful money of the United States, the sum of Two Million Three Hundred Ninety-Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety Four Dollars ($2,398,794), with interest as provided herein.

 This Note is given to evidence a loan (the "Loan") made pursuant to the Loan Agreement dated as of , 2007 (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), between the Obligor and the Payee. The funds used by the Payee to make the Loan have been obtained by Payee exclusively through the issuance of a note in the maximum commitment amount of $2,398,794 issued by the Payee, a copy of which note, with a schedule of Principal Due Dates as established by agreement of the City and HUD, is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference (including any note issued in replacement therefor or for a portion thereof that includes the amount disbursed in order to fund the Loan evidenced hereby, the "City Note") pursuant to Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC section5308) and 24 CFR 570.700, et seq., pursuant to which the Payee has entered into certain agreements, including, but not limited to, (a) with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance (as it may be amended, the "HUD Contract") which contract incorporates by reference an Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement between HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), (b) with HUD, the BEDI Grant Agreement, (which documents, as amended or amended from time to time, may be referred to collectively as the "Master Agreement"); and (c) with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement (as it may be amended, the "Custodial Agreement"). The Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is made subject to all of the terms and conditions of the HUD Contract, Master Agreement and the City Note. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the City Note, the Loan Agreement, the Custodial Agreement or the Master Agreement as applicable.

 Each portion of principal outstanding on this Note shall bear interest from the date hereof at the rate applicable to the Corresponding Advance of principal under the City Note. For each installment of principal shown on Exhibit 1 hereto, the Corresponding Advance consists of an equal amount of principal on the City Note maturing in the same year as such installment of principal hereunder.

 Interest on this Note shall be due and payable on the 15th day of each calendar month next preceding each of the following dates if interest on the City Note is scheduled to become due and payable on such date: February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year. The amount of interest payable on this Note on each such 15th day shall include interest accrued through such date and interest to accrue through the end of the month in which the interest payment becomes due under this Note. Interest on this Note also shall be due 15 days before any other date when interest shall become due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, and the amount of interest then payable on this Note shall include interest accrued and to accrue up to such date when interest shall become due on the City Note. Interest on the City Note is due and payable quarterly in arrears prior to the Conversion Date, on the Conversion Date, and semiannually thereafter. Principal on this Note is due and payable as set out on Exhibit 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Each date upon which principal or interest, or both,

 is due and payable hereunder is an "Obligor Note Payment Date."

 The principal amount due under this Note on each Obligor Note Payment Date shall be as set forth on the attached Exhibit 1, except to the extent such principal amount shall have been reduced by prepayment before such Obligor Note Payment Date as provided herein. Although no principal amounts shall be due to Payee prior to July 15, 2014, Obligor shall be required to make or cause to make payments in the cumulative amount of $____________ into a "sinking fund" cash account (on terms acceptable to Payee) in the following annual amounts by the ___ day of _____ of each year: $ in 2008; $ in 2009; $ in 2010; $ in 2011; $ in 2012; $ in 2013; and $ in 2014.

 On and after the Conversion Date (whether conversion to a fixed rate or rates is effected with the consent of the Obligor or otherwise), as more fully set forth in the City Note, each Corresponding Advance will accrue interest on the City Note at the fixed rate that the underwriters of the City Note, or securities representing participation interests in a pool of notes guaranteed by HUD, including the City Note, determine will enable them to sell the City Note or such participation interests under then prevailing market conditions as of the Conversion Date at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount thereof.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of any default hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, which default is not cured as permitted by the Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and this Note shall bear interest at the greater of the rate set as provided above or twelve percent (12%) per annum.

 Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest after the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all principal, interest, fees, costs and other charges that Obligor is obligated to pay in connection with this Note and the Loan shall be due and payable, in full, no later than July 15, 2027.

 This Note and other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by a Security Agreement - Pledge (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Security Agreement"), of even date herewith, from the Obligor for the benefit of the Payee. This Note and other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by other collateral, including without limitation security interests in the monies and investments held in certain Reserves established in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Master Agreement.

 The principal hereof and any interest accrued hereon may be prepaid, subject in the case of principal to approval by HUD of prepayment by the Payee of an equal amount of each respective Corresponding Advance on the City Note, and provided, however, that any prepayment shall be applied to the principal installment(s) with latest maturity unless otherwise agreed in writing by the holder hereof and by HUD, and provided, further:

 (a) On or before the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Payee and with, and only with, the consent of HUD. Any prepayment of the principal hereof shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, and partial prepayments shall be credited against the principal amount last becoming due hereunder.

 (b) After the Conversion Date, Obligor shall give 90 days prior written notice of its intention to make any prepayment. No partial prepayment shall relieve the Obligor of the obligation to make any future payments due after the date of any prepayment. Obligor shall pay, in addition to the principal amount of any prepayment, a premium sufficient so that the total amount paid is sufficient to defease the Corresponding Advances on the City Note, as provided in the Master Agreement. If in the event of any prepayment, the Payee incurs any costs, expenses, fees, charges, premiums or losses, the Obligor shall pay such items upon demand in addition to the principal and interest due hereunder.

 After default, any payment by Obligor or any third party, or recovery from the disposition of any collateral, to the extent applied to amounts of principal that were not yet scheduled to fall due according to Exhibit 1, may be applied to such installments of principal as the holder hereof shall elect in its discretion, and shall be deemed a prepayment of such installment for purposes of the premium and other obligations set forth in paragraph (b) above, and Obligor shall pay all such amounts on demand, or the holder hereof may apply amounts so paid or collected to such other obligations, in the holder's discretion.

 In the event of any default by Obligor in any term or condition of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Security Agreement, or any other document executed in connection herewith, which default is not cured as permitted by the applicable document, the entire principal and accrued interest hereunder shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand at the option of the holder of this Note. If the entire balance of principal and interest shall be declared due and payable after the Conversion Date, then the Obligor shall pay to the holder hereof, in addition to all other amounts owing, any further amount required in order that the holder is able to fully defease, solely from the payments by Obligor hereunder and without costs to such holder, all of the outstanding Corresponding Advances under the City Note. Obligor acknowledges that such additional amount, if any, is intended to protect the holder hereof from potential loss resulting from the enforcement of the terms hereof after default, and not as a penalty.

 If Obligor is in default under the provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Security Agreement, or any other document executed in connection herewith and Payee or other holder of this Note commences any action to enforce collection hereof or foreclosure under any security document or guaranty given in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligor agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Payee or such holder, including but not limited to Payee's or such holder's reasonable attorneys' fees.

 Demand, protest, and notice of demand and protest are hereby waived, and the Obligor, to the extent authorized by law hereby waives any and all homestead or other exemption rights which otherwise might apply to the obligation evidenced by this Note, and/or any property covered by any security document given in connection herewith. The Obligor executes this Note as a principal and not as a surety.

 I. Terms Applicable Before the Conversion Date

 A. Advances

 For value received, the undersigned, the City of Seattle (the "Borrower", which term includes any successors and assigns), a public entity organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington promises to pay to the Registered Holder (the "Holder," which term includes any successors or assigns), at the time, in the manner, and with interest at the rate or rates hereinafter provided, such amounts as may be advanced under this Note from time to time by the Holder for disbursement to, or on behalf of, the Borrower (individually, an "Advance", and collectively, "Advances"). The Holder shall make Advances upon the written request of the Borrower and the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his designee (the "Secretary"), pursuant to the Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance (as further defined in Section IV.A. of this Note, the "Contract"), and the Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement (the "Fiscal Agency Agreement") dated as of May 17, 2000, between The Chase Manhattan Bank (now known as JPMorgan Chase Bank), as Fiscal Agent (the "Fiscal Agent"), and the Secretary. The total amount of Advances made for each Principal Due Date under this Note shall not exceed the applicable Commitment Amount for such Principal Due Date set forth on the Commitment Schedule attached hereto. The aggregate of all Advances under this Note for all Principal Due Dates shall not exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount specified on the attached Commitment Schedule. The Fiscal Agent shall record the date and amount of all payments and Advances on this Note and maintain the books and records of all such Advances and Commitment Amounts for each corresponding Principal Due Date, and all payments. No Advances shall be made on this Note after its Conversion Date.

 As used herein, "Conversion Date" means the date (if any) upon which this Note is (i) delivered by the Holder to the Fiscal Agent against payment therefore by the purchasers selected by the Secretary to make such payment; and (ii) assigned to JPMorgan Chase Bank (or any successor thereto) acting in its capacity as Trustee (the "Trustee") pursuant to a Trust Agreement between the Secretary and the Trustee, dated as of January 1, 1995, as such agreement may be amended or supplemented (the "Trust Agreement"). Upon the occurrence of both (i) and (ii) in the previous sentence, Section III of this Note applies, thereby converting this Note to a fixed rate obligation.

 B. Variable Rate of Interest

From and including the date of each Advance to but excluding the earlier of (i) the Conversion Date, and (ii) the date of redemption or prepayment of such Advance pursuant to Section I.D. below (each such date of redemption or prepayment, a "Prepayment Date") interest shall be paid quarterly at a variable interest rate (as set forth below) on the unpaid principal balance of each Advance on the first day of each February, May, August and November (each, an "Interim Payment Date"), commencing on the first Interim Payment Date after the initial Advance is made under this Note. Interest also shall be paid on each applicable Conversion Date, Prepayment Date or Principal Due Date. The amount of interest payable on each Interim Payment Date will represent interest accrued during the three-month period ending immediately prior to such Interim Payment Date, or in the case of the first Interim Payment Date following each Advance that is not made on an Interim Payment Date, the period from and including the date of such Advance to but excluding the first Interim Payment Date following such Advance. The amount of interest payable on this Note's Conversion Date, Prepayment Date, or on any Principal Due Date

 that precedes such Conversion Date will represent interest accrued during the period from the last Interim Payment Date to such Conversion Date, Prepayment Date, or Principal Due Date, respectively.

 The initial variable interest rate for each Advance will be set on the date of such Advance and will be equal to 20 basis points (0.2%) above the Applicable LIBO Rate (as hereinafter defined) and thereafter will be adjusted monthly on the first day of each month (each, a "Reset Date") to a variable interest rate equal to 20 basis points (0.2%) above the Applicable LIBO Rate (such interest rate, as reset from time to time, the "Standard Note Rate"). If the Conversion Date for this Note has not occurred by the March 1 following the initial Advance under this Note, then the terms of Appendix A shall be used to set the variable interest rate. If the Fiscal Agent does not receive notice of either a Negotiated Special Interest Rate or Holder Determined Special Interest Rate (as defined in Appendix A attached hereto) from the Secretary or Holder, respectively, by the times specified in Appendix A to this Note, then the Standard Note Rate shall apply for the period to which such Negotiated Special Interest Rate or Holder Determined Special Interest Rate would otherwise apply. The Fiscal Agent may conclusively rely on any such notice as to the correctness of any matters set forth therein. Appendix A shall be inapplicable to this Note on or after the Conversion Date.

 "LIBO Rate" for any given Business Day means, except in the case of manifest error, the interest rate per annum published on that day in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal or any successor publication ("WSJ"), published by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., in the section titled "Money Rates" (or any successor section) and opposite the caption "London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) -- three months" (or any successor caption). If such rate does not appear in WSJ on a given Business Day, for each interest period, the LIBO Rate shall be the interest rate, converted to a bond-equivalent yield basis, for deposits in U.S. dollars for three months which appears on Telerate Page 3750 or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying such rate (together, "Telerate Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the day (the "Determination Date") that is two London Banking Days preceding the relevant Reset Date or Advance. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 on such Determination Date, such rate shall be obtained from the Reuters Screen ISDA Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date. If, in turn, such rate does not appear on the Reuters Screen ISDA Page on such Determination Date, the offered quotation from each of four reference banks (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date for deposits in U.S. dollars to prime banks on the London interbank market for a 3-month period, commencing on the Reset Date or date of such Advance, shall be obtained. If at least two such quotations are provided, the LIBO Rate for such Reset Date or date of such Advance will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, rounded to five decimal places. If fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, the LIBO Rate for that Determination Date shall be the rate for the most recent day preceding such Determination Date for which the LIBO Rate shall have been displayed on Telerate Page 3750. The LIBO Rate for any interest period shall be converted to a bond-equivalent yield basis by multiplying such rate by the actual number of days in such interest period and dividing that number by 180.

 "Applicable LIBO Rate" means: (1) with respect to the initial interest rate for the first Advance hereunder, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before the date of such first Advance; (2) with respect to the initial interest rate for any subsequent Advance made before the first Reset Date, the interest rate borne by the first Advance; (3) with respect to the initial interest rate for any subsequent Advance made after the first Reset Date, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before the immediately preceding Reset Date; and (4) with respect to the subsequent interest rate at any Reset Date for any Advance, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before such Reset Date.

 "London Banking Day" means any day in which dealings in deposits in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days lapsed.

 C. Principal Amount

 Prior to the Conversion Date, the aggregate amount of Advances under this Note for each specified Principal Due Date shall be the Principal Amount paid by the Borrower on such Principal Due Date (as assigned to such Advances by the Secretary's instructions to the Fiscal Agent in accordance with the Contract and the Fiscal Agency Agreement), except to the extent such Principal Amount shall have been reduced by redemption before such Principal Due Date as provided below.

 D. Redemption before Conversion Date

 At any time on or before the Conversion Date, the Borrower, with the consent of the Secretary, may redeem this Note, in whole or in part, upon fourteen calendar days notice to the Fiscal Agent and the Secretary, at the purchase price of one hundred percent (100%) of the unpaid Principal Amount to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Partial redemptions shall be credited against the applicable Principal Amount(s). The related Commitment Amounts and the Maximum Commitment Amount shall be adjusted concurrently with any such redemptions in accordance with the Secretary's instructions to the Fiscal Agent pursuant to the Contract and the Fiscal Agency Agreement.

 II. Conversion

 The following events shall occur on the Conversion Date:

 A. Schedule P&I

 On the Conversion Date all Advances owed by the Borrower under this Note with the same Principal Due Date shall be aggregated into a single Principal Amount which will accrue interest at the fixed rate applicable to such Principal Due Date. Such Principal Amount may be adjusted by the Fiscal Agent in accordance with the following paragraph or paragraph IV.H, as applicable. Whether or not adjusted, each Principal Amount, the fixed rate applicable to each Principal Amount, and the applicable Principal Due Date, shall be listed by the Secretary in Schedule P&I. Schedule P&I will be provided by the Secretary to the Fiscal Agent and attached to this Note by the Fiscal Agent upon the Fiscal Agent's receipt of this Note on the Conversion Date.

 B. Conversion Date Advances

 If, on or prior to the Conversion Date, the Borrower has not utilized the entire Commitment Amount indicated on the Commitment Schedule attached hereto for a given Principal Due Date, the Borrower may, in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Contract, and with the approval of the Secretary, utilize such Commitment Amount on the Conversion Date to obtain a Conversion Date Advance. A "Conversion Date Advance" shall mean any amount by which the Secretary instructs the Fiscal Agent to increase a Principal Amount on Schedule P&I for a given Principal Due Date, effective as of the Conversion Date of this Note. Conversion Date Advances shall be funded by the sale of this Note to the purchaser selected by the Secretary. The proceeds of a Conversion Date Advance (net of any applicable fees) shall be distributed to or on behalf of the Borrower on the Conversion Date. The total amount of Conversion Date Advances hereunder shall not exceed the sum of any unused Commitment Amounts for all Principal Due Dates.

 III. Terms Applicable Upon Conversion

The following terms shall apply to this Note from the Conversion Date (if any) until this Note is canceled, or matured and paid in full:

 Commencing on the Conversion Date, the Borrower promises to pay to the Holder on the applicable Principal Due Date each Principal Amount set forth on the attached Schedule P&I, together with interest on each such Principal Amount at the rate applicable thereto specified on the Schedule P&I. Interest shall be calculated and payments shall be made in the manner set forth below.

 Interest on each scheduled Principal Amount of this Note due as of a given date specified on Schedule P&I hereto shall accrue at the related per annum rate specified on Schedule P&I from (and including) the Conversion Date to (but excluding) such Principal Due Date or, if applicable, to the applicable Interest Due Date on which an Optional Redemption (as defined below) occurs. Each interest amount accrued on each unpaid Principal Amount of this Note shall be due semiannually as of February 1 and August 1 of each year (each such February 1 and August 1, an "Interest Due Date") commencing on the first such date after the Conversion Date, until each Principal Amount listed on Schedule P&I to this Note is paid in full. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 Certain Principal Amounts that are indicated as being eligible for Optional Redemption on Schedule P&I may be paid, in whole or in part, at the option of the Borrower as of any Interest Due Date on or after the date specified in such schedule (an "Optional Redemption"). In order to elect an Optional Redemption of such a Principal Amount, the Borrower shall give notice of its intention to prepay a Principal Amount to the Trustee and the Secretary not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days prior to the Interest Due Date as of which the Borrower intends to prepay the Principal Amount. The Trustee shall apply any payments received in respect of Optional Redemptions in accordance with written instructions of the Borrower, as approved by the Secretary. Principal Amounts that are not indicated as being eligible for Optional Redemption on Schedule P&I may not be prepaid.

 IV. General Terms

 A. Additional Definitions

 For purposes of this Note, the following terms shall be defined as follows:

 "Business Day" shall mean a day on which banking institutions in New York City are not required or authorized to remain closed and on which the Federal Reserve Bank and the New York Stock Exchange are not closed.

 Trustee (as applicable) on the seventh Business Day prior to the appropriate Interim Payment Date, Interest Due Date, Principal Due Date, Prepayment Date, or date of Optional Redemption, as applicable.

 C. Interest on Late Payments

 If a payment of principal or interest herein provided for shall not be made by either (i) 2:30 p.m. on an Interest Due Date or Principal Due Date; or (ii) 2:30 p.m. on the second Business Day (as herein defined) next succeeding an Interim Payment Date, then interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment at the then applicable interest rate or rates payable on this Note, from the relevant due date, as the case may be, until the date such payment is made. Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall be construed as permitting or implying that the Borrower may, without the written consent of the Holder and the Secretary, modify, extend, alter or affect in any manner whatsoever the right of the Holder timely to receive any and all payments of principal and interest specified in this Note.

 D. Applicability of Fiscal Agency Agreement or Trust Agreement

 Prior to the Conversion Date, this Note and Advances and payments made hereunder shall be administered pursuant to the terms of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and are subject to such agreement. On or after the Conversion Date, this Note and Advances and payments made hereunder shall be administered pursuant to the Trust Agreement and are subject to such agreement. The terms and provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Trust Agreement, insofar as they affect the rights, duties and obligations of the Holder and/or the Borrower, are hereby incorporated herein and form a part of this Note. The Borrower hereby agrees to be bound by all obligations of the Borrower to the Fiscal Agent set forth in the Fiscal Agency Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this Note shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Fiscal Agency Agreement or Trust Agreement, as applicable. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides for the Fiscal Agent to perform certain duties, including the duties of (i) paying agent and calculation agent for this Note until its Conversion Date, and (ii) registrar for this Note until this Note is canceled or a new registrar appointed, each in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Trust Agreement provides for the Trustee to perform certain duties, including the duties of collection agent for this Note after its Conversion Date until a new Trustee is appointed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. This Note may be surrendered to the Fiscal Agent for registration of transfer or exchange, as provided in the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Fiscal Agent and Trustee each shall permit reasonable inspection to be made of a copy of the Fiscal Agency Agreement or Trust Agreement kept on file at its respective corporate trust office. Neither the Fiscal Agency Agreement nor the Trust Agreement shall change the Borrower's payment obligations under this Note.

 E. Applicability of Contract and Secretary's Guarantee

 This Note evidences indebtedness incurred pursuant to and in accordance with the Contract and pursuant to Section 108 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 5308) (the "HCD Act").

The payment of principal on the applicable Principal Due Dates and interest on the applicable Interim Payment Dates or Interest Due Dates under this Note is unconditionally guaranteed by the Secretary to the Holder through a guarantee (the "Guarantee"). Execution of the Secretary's Guarantee is required before this Note is effective, and such Guarantee shall be issued pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Contract and Section 108 of the HCD Act.

 F. Default

 A default under this Note shall occur upon failure by the Borrower to pay principal or interest on this Note when due hereunder. If a Borrower defaults on the payment of any interest or Principal Amounts when due, or if the Secretary gives notice of a final decision to declare the Borrower in default pursuant to the following paragraph of this Section IV.F, the Secretary may, but is not obligated to, make on any date on or prior to the Conversion Date with fourteen calendar

 days prior notice to the Fiscal Agent, or on the seventh Business Day preceding any Interest Due Date on or after the first permissible Optional Redemption date with seven Business Days prior notice to the Trustee, an acceleration payment to the Fiscal Agent or the Trustee, as applicable, equal to the Aggregate Principal Amount of the Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to such acceleration payment date or Interest Due Date, as applicable. In the event that any such acceleration payment is made from sources other than funds pledged by the Borrower as security under the Contract (or other Borrower funds), the amounts paid on behalf of the Borrower shall be deemed to be immediately due and payable to the Secretary. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as permitting or implying that the Borrower may, without the written consent of the Holder and the Secretary, modify, extend, alter or affect in any manner whatsoever the right of the Holder timely to receive any and all payments of principal and interest specified in this Note.

 In addition, the Secretary may declare the Borrower in default under this Note if the Secretary makes a final decision in accordance with the provisions of 24 C.F.R. section 570.913 (or any successor regulation thereof), including requirements for reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that the Borrower has failed to comply substantially with Title I of the HCD Act. Following the giving of such reasonable notice, the Secretary may take the remedial actions specified as available in the relevant provisions of the Contract pending the Secretary's final decision.

 G. Holder's Reliance on Guarantee

 Following a default by the Borrower under the terms of this Note, the Holder agrees to rely wholly and exclusively for repayment of this Note upon the Guarantee. The enforcement of any instruments or agreements securing or otherwise related to this Note shall be the sole responsibility of the Secretary, and the Holder shall not be

 responsible for the preparation, contents or administration of such instruments and agreements, or for any actions taken in connection with such instruments and agreement. The Holder, to the extent it is legally able to do so, shall bind or cause to be bound its successors and assigns to all limitations imposed upon the Holder by this Note.

 H. Amendment

 This Note may only be amended with the prior written consent of the Secretary and the Borrower. No such amendment shall reduce, without the prior written consent of the Holder of this Note, in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments required to be received on this Note by the Holder, Fiscal Agent or Trustee, including Guarantee Payments; provided that prior to the Conversion Date, the Commitment Amounts on the Commitment Schedule attached hereto, and the Principal Amounts due on the corresponding Principal Due Dates may be rescheduled pursuant to written instructions given to the Fiscal Agent by the Secretary with the written agreement of the Borrower and the Secretary absent the consent of the Holder.

 I. Waivers

 The Borrower hereby waives any requirement for presentment, protest or other demand or notice with respect to this Note. The Borrower hereby waives notice of default and opportunity for hearing for any failure to make a payment when due.

 J. Delivery and Effective Date

 This Note is deemed issued, executed, and delivered on behalf of the Borrower by its authorized official as an obligation guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to Section 108 of the HCD Act, effective as of the date of the Secretary's Guarantee.

 V. Borrower-Specific Provisions

THIS NOTE IS NOT AN OBLIGATION OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE OR THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OR ANY MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OR SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE, OR ANY AGENCY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, OR PREMIUM, IF ANY, ON THIS NOTE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR INDEBTEDNESS OF THE BORROWER PAYABLE FROM PUBLIC FUNDS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY LIMITATION ON THE INCURRING OF DEBT.

 APPENDIX A

Special Pre-Conversion Interest Rates.

 (a) The Holder and the Secretary contemplate that the majority of the outstanding Variable/Fixed Rate Notes will be purchased by underwriters selected by the Secretary for sale in public offerings to occur each year. If a public offering including this Note has not occurred by each March 1 following the initial Advance under this Note, the Secretary shall, upon request, advise the Holder as to when a public offering including this Note is expected to occur, and the Holder and the Secretary agree to consult with each other as to what the interest rate on this Note will be after May 1 of that year if a public offering has not occurred by such May 1. The Holder shall notify the Secretary if such consultation has not occurred by April 1 of that year. If no public offering including this Note has occurred on or before such May 1, the applicable interest rate on this Note from such May 1 shall be the rate (if any) negotiated and agreed upon by the Secretary and the Holder. Such rate may be the Standard Note Rate or some other rate agreed upon by the Holder and the Secretary at least two Business Days before such May 1 (such other rate, the "Negotiated Special Interest Rate"). The Secretary shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Holder in writing of any Negotiated Special Interest Rate within two Business Days of the determination thereof.

 (b) If the Secretary and the Holder do not, by the April 15th preceding such May 1, negotiate and agree under Section (a) of this Appendix on an interest rate applicable to this Note, then the Holder may, on or before the April 20th preceding such May 1, give written notice to the Secretary of its intent to change the interest rate on this Note and, if such notice was given during such period, the Holder may, on such May 1, unilaterally determine (subject to the terms of this paragraph) the interest rate that this Note will bear (such rate, the "Holder Determined Interest Rate") from and including such May 1 to but excluding the earliest of: (i) the Conversion Date; (ii) the date that this Note is purchased by a new Holder (as described in Section (c) below) or (iii) a Monthly Special Reset Date (as defined below). Interest from and including such May 1 to but excluding the Public Offering Date shall be paid on the unpaid principal balance of all outstanding Advances under this Note at the rate(s) to be determined by the Holder which, based upon then prevailing market conditions and taking into account all the circumstances, will enable the Holder to sell this Note at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount of all Advances hereunder prior to the date of such sale. Such interest rate shall be determined as of such May 1 and shall be determined again on the foregoing basis on the first of each month thereafter (the first of each month after such May 1, a "Monthly Special Reset Date"). The Holder shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Secretary in writing within two Business Days following such dates of the determination of the Holder Determined Interest Rate and each applicable interest rate determined on a Monthly Special Reset Date.

 (c) If the Secretary and the Holder have failed to agree upon an interest rate pursuant to Section (a) of this Appendix A, the Secretary, upon seven calendar days notice to the Holder, may arrange for the purchase of this Note in full by another entity on the following May 1 or any Business Day thereafter. If such a purchase occurs, the Holder shall sell and assign this Note to the purchaser thereof without recourse to the Holder and deliver this Note and its Guarantee to the Fiscal Agent for registration in the name of the purchaser thereof in accordance with the Secretary's written instructions. The purchase price for this Note shall be 100% of the aggregate amount of all Advances owing hereunder plus accrued interest to the date of purchase. Payment to the Holder of the purchase price for this Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof in Federal funds at the offices of the Holder, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Holder and the Secretary, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of purchase. After such purchase date this Note shall bear a rate of interest negotiated between the Secretary and the new interim Holder (the "New Purchaser Special Interest Rate"). The Secretary shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the new purchaser in writing of any New Purchaser Special Interest Rate within two Business Days following the date of determination thereof.

 (d) Notwithstanding Sections (a) through (c) (inclusive) of this Appendix, no Borrower is obligated to pay interest at a variable rate exceeding the maximum rate permitted by generally applicable law of the Borrower's state (such rate, the "Maximum Rate"). If the Borrower receives notice of a variable interest payment that exceeds the Maximum Rate, then the Borrower shall timely pay such amount as does not exceed the Maximum Rate, and concurrently shall notify the Secretary and the Fiscal Agent of the reason for any interest non- payment.

 *This schedule will not be completed when initially executed and delivered by the Borrower for Guarantee for interim, variable-rate financing. It will be completed when assigned by the Holder at the request of the Borrower for conversion to Fixed Rates on the Conversion Date. The first date shown above on which Optional Redemption is available is expected to be the same when this schedule is completed, if the Borrower participates in the initial Section 108 public offering after receiving an interim financing Advance hereunder. If the Borrower participates in a later public offering, the first date on which Optional Redemption is available is expected to be correspondingly later.
