 AN ORDINANCE relating to the monorail Green Line in Seattle; submitting an advisory ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle at the general election to be held on November 8, 2005; calling upon the City Clerk to certify the proposed measure to the Director of Records and Elections of King County; and requesting the Director of Records and Elections to submit the measure to the qualified electors.

 WHEREAS, voters in Seattle having voted to support the monorail on four occasions, it is appropriately respectful of the democratic process that they be asked their advice regarding whether the City of Seattle should stop the use of City property and other City resources to support the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority's continued efforts to plan, design, finance, construct, and operate the Green Line;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Request for Election: The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested to include on the ballot at the state-wide general election on November 8, 2005, and submit to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle, the advisory ballot measure set forth below.

 Section 2. Advisory Ballot Measure: The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to certify to the King County Director of Records and Elections the following advisory ballot measure:

 MONORAIL ADVISORY

 WHEREAS, in 2002, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority (SPMA) was established by voters in Seattle to plan, finance, build, acquire, complete, operate, charge for, and maintain an approximately 14-mile- long monorail transit line as set forth in the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan (Green Line), to be funded by motor vehicle excise taxes collected from Seattle residents; and

 WHEREAS, SPMA staff negotiated a proposed contract with the sole bidder on the Green Line project, and in June 2005 publicly announced the contract and a financing plan to go with it; and

 WHEREAS, the SPMA staff financing plan differed significantly from what was represented to voters in Seattle when they approved creation of the SPMA and funding for the Green Line; and

 WHEREAS, the projected tax revenues for the SPMA are significantly less than anticipated when voters in Seattle approved creation of the SPMA and funding for the Green Line; and

 WHEREAS, on June 30, 2005, the SPMA Board rejected the SPMA staff financing plan, and since then the SPMA staff has not provided an alternative financing or construction plan to the SPMA Board, the City of Seattle, or the citizens of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle continues to spend its staff resources supporting SPMA's efforts to design and construct the Green Line, including planning the necessary changes in and under City streets to accommodate the Green Line; and

 WHEREAS, the Green Line cannot as a practical matter be built without using City-owned property, including City streets; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has the ability to stop the SPMA from using City streets and other property for the Green Line, because state law (RCW 35.95A.050(1 prevents the SPMA from using City-owned property without the City's consent; and

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance 121517 the City stated that its consent for SPMA to use City streets and other rights of way would not be deemed complete until the City Council votes by resolution to allow City departments to issue project construction permits to the SPMA for the Green Line; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has not yet voted by resolution to give final City consent to the use of streets and other rights of way for the Green Line;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 Should the voters give the following advisory to the Mayor and City Council of the City of Seattle?

 The City of Seattle should stop the construction of the SPMA Green Line by taking all steps that are necessary and proper and within the City's authority. These steps include but are not limited to the following:

 * withhold consent for the use or acquisition by SPMA of any City of Seattle property, such as streets and the Seattle Center;

 * withhold City Council authorization for City departments to issue project construction permits to the SPMA for the Green Line;

 * stop spending City resources to support SPMA's efforts to design, construct, or otherwise create the Green Line; and

 * stop spending City resources to plan the necessary changes in and under City streets to accommodate the Green Line.

 Section 3. Effective Date: This ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, then on the eleventh (11th) day after its presentation to the Mayor, or if vetoed by the Mayor, then immediately after its passage over his veto.
