 WHEREAS, Ordinances 106488 and 117991 expired on March 25, 1997; and

 WHEREAS, Fremont Dock Co. desires to use and occupy a portion of Fremont Avenue North under the Fremont Bridge North Approach lying north of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and south of the former Burlington Northern Main Line Right-of-Way in exchange for the granting of a twenty-five (25) foot wide easement across Permittee's property for access to the Fremont Bridge North Approach; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the Fremont Dock Co., successors and assigns, (Permittee), to use and occupy a portion of Fremont Avenue North under the Fremont Bridge North Approach and lying between the northerly margin of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and the southerly boundary of the former Burlington Northern Main Line Right-of-Way and described in Exhibit A (the "Use Area").

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to Permittee shall be for a term of ten (10) years, commencing at the completion of the Fremont Bridge Approaches Project as determined by the Director of Transportation (Director) (the "Commencement Date") and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year from the Commencement Date. The Permittee shall have the option to extend this Permit for two (2) additional ten (10) year terms. Upon written application of Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the then applicable term, the Director shall renew the permit for a successive ten (10) year term. The total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of the City of Seattle (City) by ordinance or otherwise to revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein at the time of each renewal. Permittee shall have the option not to extend this Permit by not filing a new acceptance.

 Section 3. The permission granted is hereby subject to any protection, support or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owner of the utility due to any of Permittee's construction, repair, reconstruction or maintenance activities related to its use and occupancy. And such protection, support, relocation, repair, reconstruction and maintenance shall be done at Permittee's sole cost and expense with the Permittee being responsible at Permittee's sole cost and expense for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to any of Permittee's construction, repair, reconstruction or maintenance activities related to its use and occupancy.

 Section 4. The permission granted hereby is subject to the primary and secondary use by the City and public of the Fremont Avenue North street right-of-way for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right upon thirty (30) days written notice to require Permittee to remove Permittee's use and occupancy at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City determines that the space used and occupied by Permittee is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that Permittee's use and occupancy interferes with any primary or secondary use or benefit (a City determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final); or

 (b) The City determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by the Permittee after written notice of the violation has been issued by the City and Permittee has had thirty (30) days to cure such alleged non- compliance.

 Section 5. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of Permittee's use and occupancy pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove," as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove its use and occupancy and shall place all portions of the space under the Fremont Bridge North Approach that may have been disturbed for any part of Permittee's use and occupation, in as good condition for public use as it was prior to the use, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall promptly issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge and such issuance shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 Section 6. Permittee shall not commence its use and occupancy of the Use Area except in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director. Permittee shall submit its plans and specifications to the Director and the Director shall review such plans in a timely manner. The Director in his/her judgment may order reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the Use Area at Permittee's own cost and expense because of deterioration or unsafe conditions, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause, resulting from Permittee's use and occupation of the Use Area.

 Section 7. After written notice to Permittee, and failure of Permittee to correct an unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order the Use Area closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, written notice is not required, and the Director may summarily close the Use Area. In the event any such closure is the result of conditions or events beyond the control of Permittee, then the current term of the permit shall be extended by the same number of days that the Use Area is closed.

 Section 8. Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the permission granted herein, or closure or removal of Permittee's use and occupancy Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until: (i) the Use Area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (ii) the Director certifies that Permittee has discharged its obligation herein, and such certification shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 Section 9. The Use Area shall remain the exclusive responsibility of Permittee. Permittee, by acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, releases the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to Permittee's property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with the City, to at all times protect and save harmless The City from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description, including reasonable attorney fees and necessary litigation expenses incurred by the City (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, by reason of Permittee's use and occupancy of the Use Area, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done by Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, then Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon written notice thereof from the City, defend the City at its sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 (a) the City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,

 (b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Permittee specifically and expressly agrees to waive Permittee's and Permittee's successors' and assigns' immunity under industrial insurance, Title 51 of the Revised Code of Washington, to the extent necessary to provide the City with a full and complete indemnity from claims made by employees of Permittee or Permittee's successors and assigns. Permittee, on behalf of Permittee and Permittee's successors and assigns, specifically and expressly agrees that such waiver of immunity was mutually negotiated by the parties.

 Section 10. For as long as Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until Permittee's use and occupancy is entirely removed and discontinued and Permittee discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 5 of this ordinance, Permittee shall (unless the City and Permittee mutually agree that insurance is unavailable at a reasonable cost) obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, insurance policies which protect the City from any all claims and risks of any loss from perils which can be insured against under commercial general liability insurance contracts and fire insurance policies, including any extended coverage endorsements thereto which are customarily available from time to time for:

 (a) construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use or existence of Permittee's use and occupancy permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of the Use Area;

 (b) Permittee's activity upon or the use or occupation of the Use Area, as well as;

 (c) any and all claims and risks in conjunction with and activity performed by Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance.

 Minimum insurance requirements shall be for a commercial general liability insurance policy of a form, and placed with insurers, acceptable to the City. Minimum limits of liability shall be $2,000,000 each occurrence combined single limit bodily injury and property damage and $4,000,000 annual aggregate. Coverage shall specifically apply to the Use Area under the Fremont Bridge North Approach exposure. The policy shall include the City, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insureds either by designated additional insured endorsement or by blanket additional insured policy wording, either of which shall expressly provide such additional insured status for the City in its role of governmental permitting. Coverage shall be on a primary basis and not contributory with any insurance or self-insurance that the City may maintain. Evidence of current coverage shall be maintained on file with the City's Risk Manager in the form of a copy of certification of property and liability insurance coverage, including an actual copy of the designated additional insured endorsement to the commercial general liability insurance policy or of the blanket additional insured wording forming a part thereof. Whenever in the judgment of the City's Risk Manager, the coverage's or limits of such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect the City, Permittee shall, upon written demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Section 11. Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors and subcontractors at all tiers that performing construction work on the Use Area as contemplated by this permit, name the City as an additional insured on all policies of commercial general liability insurance for such project(s), and shall include in all contract documents for such project(s) a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to Permittee to the City as well.

 Section 12. Permittee, its successors and assigns shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance and Fremont Dock Co. shall be released therefrom. This consent requirement does not apply to any lessees or sublessees of Fremont Dock Co.

 Section 13. Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City reasonable costs to inspect the Use Area to ensure the safety of the use and occupancy, under the direction of the Director, as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.76.

 Section 14. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director sixty (60) days prior to the Commencement Date of this term permit along with an easement agreement accepted by the Director for a non-exclusive 25-foot wide easement across Permittee's property for access to the Fremont Bridge North Approach. Upon expiration or earlier termination, for any reason, of this term permit or ordinance, the easement shall be terminated concurrently. The acceptance of the permission and easement agreement shall be filed with the City Clerk, who shall then record the easement agreement with the King County Recorder's Office. If the accepted easement agreement is not received sixty (60) days prior to the Commencement Date of this term permit, then the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 15. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
