 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning of adult cabarets, extending the moratorium on the issuance of use permits, and on the acceptance of applications for use permits or building permits, for adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby adopts the following findings of fact:

 a. There are a number of adult cabarets located near residential areas throughout the City;

 b. There is growing evidence that such uses constitute a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare;

 c. In May 2004, the City Council passed and the Mayor signed Ordinance 121465 establishing a moratorium through June 30, 2005 on new adult cabarets within the City pending additional City analysis and evaluation;

 d. The City Council chooses to study and evaluate the issues involved regulating sexually-oriented businesses in greater detail;

 e. The Seattle City Council has developed a work plan for developing and evaluating land use code amendments for adult entertainment uses described in Attachment A; and

 f. The Council recognizes that it will take time for the Executive to prepare proposed legislation and for the Council to review and take action, and therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the moratorium on new adult cabarets.

 g. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the Growth Management Act, RCW 36.70A.390.

 Section 2. Through June 30, 2006 or until new land use regulations governing the location of adult cabarets take effect, whichever is sooner, no use permit shall be issued, nor shall any use permit application or building permit application be accepted, for any new adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.

 Section 3. Pursuant to SMC 25.05.880, the City Council finds that an exemption under SEPA for this action is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to public health and safety and to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation through continued development under the existing regulations. SEPA review of any permanent regulations proposed for replacement of the existing zoning shall be conducted.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ______ day of _______________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ______ day of _______________, 2005.

 Seattle City Council

 Adult Cabarets

 Work Plan and Schedule

 March 15, 2005

 The City Council directs the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) to work with the Law Department to develop and evaluate possible Land Use Code amendments regarding adult cabarets, considering the locations in the City where these uses would have minimal negative impacts and could be sited appropriately.

 In particular, DPD and the Law Department should monitor court decisions and/or legislation throughout the country relating to adult uses. DPD and the Law Department should consider the various types of adult businesses and how they are defined, negative impacts and secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses, appropriateness of creating buffer zones around adult uses, appropriateness of amortizing non-conforming businesses, and other issues.

 DPD should prepare legislation to implement any regulatory changes, and should complete environmental review as required under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

 DPD is requested to submit periodic progress reports on the status of its efforts under this work plan to Council President Jan Drago, Chair, Government Affairs and Labor Committee.
