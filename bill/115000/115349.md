 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE transferring jurisdiction over portions of Puget Boulevard from Seattle Department of Transportation to the Department of Parks and Recreation for park, recreation, parkway and boulevard purposes.

 WHEREAS, by indenture dated December 30, 1912, Puget Mill Company deeded the City of Seattle a strip of land, since known as Puget Boulevard, 160 feet in width across Section 24, Township 24, North of Range 3, east of W.M., King County, Washington, specifying that the southerly 80 feet of said strip be "for parkway and boulevard purposes" and the northerly 80 feet be "for ordinary street purposes;" and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 30865, the City accepted the deed "for boulevard and parkway strip and for ordinary street purposes;" and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) has jurisdiction over those portions of Puget Boulevard identified for ordinary street purposes and the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) has jurisdiction over those portions of Puget Boulevard identified for parkway and boulevard purposes; and

 WHEREAS, portions of Puget Boulevard under SDOT's jurisdiction are not now and have never been improved for ordinary street purposes; and

 WHEREAS, funds are now available through the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails, and Zoo Levy for improvement of Puget Boulevard; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT agrees that those portions of Puget Boulevard proposed for park improvements under the Levy are not currently needed for ordinary street purposes; and
