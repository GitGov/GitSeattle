 AN ORDINANCE amending the 2007 Adopted Budget by abrogating one position and augmenting another in the Solid Waste Fund of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU).

 WHEREAS, the 2007 Adopted Budget added two additional painters to Seattle Public Utilities' Graffiti Rangers plus other related staff and expenses, in order to support a citywide 48-hour graffiti cleanup policy; and

 WHEREAS, the City decided not to provide such funding to other City departments; and

 WHEREAS, a recent benchmark study comparing Seattle with peer cities found that Seattle's anti-graffiti program devotes comparatively fewer resources to public education, outreach and volunteers than several peer cities - components that show promise to abate and prevent graffiti; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that it is most cost effective to abrogate one of the painter positions and to use those funds to support public education program costs and convert the new Public Education Program Specialist from part-time to full-time, in order for Seattle Public Utilities to perform outreach to schools and youth groups, to educate and dissuade potential taggers, and to grow and manage a corps of neighborhood volunteers who can provide extra eyes and ears to report graffiti and assist with paint-outs on public and private property; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The following position in Seattle Public Utilities is abrogated:

 Department Position Title Position Status Number abrogated

 Seattle Public Utilities Painter Full-time (1) (#10003779)

 Section 2. The following position is increased from 0.5 FTE to 1.0 FTE:

 Department Position Title Budgeted FTE Change Position Status

 Seattle Public Utilities Public Education Part Time (0.5) + 0.5 Program Specialist (#10003783)

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2007, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2007.
