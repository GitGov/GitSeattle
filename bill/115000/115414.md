 AN ORDINANCE amending Seattle Municipal Code chapter 25.09, relating to environmentally critical areas, and amending related provisions of Seattle Municipal Code Title 23, Sections 23.28.030, 23.22.058, 23.44.008, 23.44.010, 23.44.014, 23.44.024, 23.45.014, 23.45.056, 23.45.072, 23.53.010, 23.53.015, 23.53.020, 23.53.025, 23.53.030, 23.84.010, 23.90.002.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle wishes to adopt regulations to promote safe, stable, and compatible development and to protect critical areas pursuant to the authority of Chapter 36.70A RCW (the "Growth Management Act"), including the statewide planning goals, and pursuant to the City's police power authority independent of the Growth Management Act to adopt planning and zoning regulations; and

 WHEREAS, compliance with the Growth Management Act requires balancing of competing goals which cannot always be reconciled easily in a single regulatory ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, Council recognizes that the successful implementation of the Environmentally Critical Areas ordinance increases the ongoing local and regional need to develop and implement policies that provide adequate housing capacity and identify suitable buildable lands; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle wishes to adopt regulations to implement the City's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has engaged in public participation, has considered the best available science, the statewide planning goals, and the City's Comprehensive Plan, and has determined that it is appropriate to amend its environmentally critical areas regulations and Title 23 based on the information and analysis set out in the Director's Report and Recommendations;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Title 25.09 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 25.09.010 ~~Moratorium on development in landslide-prone areas~~

 Purpose of the chapter.

~~Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of Chapter 23.76, all public and private development that is subject to this chapter and proposed for landslide-prone areas, as described in Section 25.09.020 B1a, is prohibited during the term of this section, except that the Director may approve the following:~~

~~A. Work that will not disturb the ground, such as interior repairs to existing structures;~~

~~B. Work that is necessary to stabilize a site that has been rendered unstable by recent slide activity, so as to lessen the risk of new or additional damage;~~

~~C. Work that is necessary to repair damaged structures or utilities, as long as the Director is reasonably satisfied that the work will not increase the risk of either short-term or long-term damage to the site or neighboring property;~~

~~D. Work that would be exempted pursuant to Section 25.09.040, provided that work that would be exempted pursuant to subsections B, C, and F may be approved only if the Director is reasonably satisfied that the work will not increase the risk of either short-term or long-term damage to the site or neighboring property; and~~

~~E. Work that would be exempted pursuant to Section 25.09.180 D1 if the Director is reasonably satisfied that the work will not increase the risk of either short-term or long-term damage to the site or neighboring property.~~

This chapter is based on and implements The City of Seattle Comprehensive Plan, as amended from time to time. It is expressly the purpose of this chapter to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and to not create or otherwise establish or designate any particular person, or class, or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or assisted by the terms or provisions of this chapter. This chapter is intended to promote safe, stable, and compatible development that avoids adverse environmental impacts and potential harm on the parcel and to adjacent property, the surrounding neighborhood, and the drainage basin.  25.09.015 Application of chapter.

A. This chapter applies to any development, as defined in Section 25.09.520, or platting carried out by any person on publicly or privately owned parcels containing an environmentally critical area or buffer.

B. This chapter applies to altering vegetation, trees, or habitat carried out by any person in landslide-prone critical areas (including steep slopes), steep slope buffers, riparian corridors, shoreline habitat, shoreline habitat buffers, wetlands, and wetland buffers on publicly or privately owned parcels.

C. Section 25.09.200 A4 applies to daylighting pipes and culverts defined in that subsection.  25.09.017 Administration.

A. The Director shall administer and interpret the provisions of this chapter, except as specifically provided.

DC. Every other City department issuing a permit for development on parcels containing an environmentally critical area or its buffer or for altering vegetation, trees, or habitat in the areas set out in subsection 25.09.015 B shall require the use of best management practices to prevent impacts to environmentally critical areas and their buffers and to meet the intent of this chapter. Departments shall require mitigation to address unavoidable impacts. All such City departments shall maintain records documenting compliance with this subsection DC.  E. The Director shall identify techniques that are best management practices for actions administered by the Director. The Director may do this by Director's Rule. The directors of other City departments applying these regulations or issuing permits for development in environmentally critical areas or their buffers may identify techniques that are best management practices and may do this by Director's Rule.

 F. The provisions of Section 23.88.020 apply to a decision by the Director as to the meaning, application, or intent of any provision of this chapter. Other administrative appeal provisions set out in Title 23 do not apply to decisions under this chapter, except as specifically provided.

 25.09.020 Environmentally critical areas definitions.

~~A. This chapter is based on and implements the Seattle Environmentally Critical Areas Policies as adopted by Resolution 28559, and as amended from time to time. This chapter shall apply to all development and platting located in environmentally critical areas as defined below and characterized by specific site conditions. It is expressly the purpose of this chapter to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and to not create or otherwise establish or designate any particular person or class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms or provisions of this chapter.~~

~~B.~~ The following ~~shall constitute~~are environmentally critical areas regulated by this chapter:

geologic hazard areas, steep slope areas, flood-prone areas, wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and abandoned landfills.

~~1~~A. Geologic Hazard Areas and Steep Slope Areas.

 1. Geologic hazard areas are liquefaction-prone areas and landslide-prone areas described in subsections 2 and 3. Landslide- prone areas include steep slope areas. Steep slope areas that are regulated for additional erosion hazards are described in subsection 4. Seismic hazards are addressed in subsection 5.

 2. Liquefaction-prone Areas. Liquefaction-prone areas are areas typically underlain by cohesionless soils of low density, usually in association with a shallow groundwater table, that lose substantial strength during earthquakes.

~~a~~3. Landslide-prone Areas. The following are ~~L~~landslide-prone areas ~~are characterized by the following~~:

~~(1)~~a. Known landslide areas identified by documented history, or ~~any~~ areas that have shown significant movement during the last ten thousand (10,000) years or are underlain by mass wastage debris ~~that occurred~~deposited during this period; or

~~(2)~~b.Potential landslide areas:~~Potential landslide areas~~~~based on documented geological characteristics, and based on a combination of geologic, topographic and hydrologic factors, including the following:~~

~~(a) Areas over fifteen (15) percent slope which have at least one (1) of the following characteristics:~~

~~(i) Impermeable soils (typically silt and clay) interbedded with permeable granular soils (predominantly sand and gravel); or impermeable soils overlain with permeable soils. This includes the area within one hundred (100) feet either side of the contact between Esperance Sand and either Lawton Clay or Pre-Lawton sediments as is shown on the area noted as Class Four (4) on the Slope Stability Map of Seattle, in Causes, Mechanisms and Prediction of Landsliding in Seattle, by Donald Willis Tubbs, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Washington, 1975 ("Tubbs Map"), or as otherwise mapped, or~~

~~(ii) Identified relatively unstable soils in either Lawton Clay or Pre-Lawton sediments, as is shown on the area noted as Class Three (3) of the Tubbs Map, or as otherwise mapped, or~~

~~(iii) Springs or groundwater seepage;~~

(1) Those areas that are described as potential slide areas in "Seattle Landslide Study" (Shannon & Wilson, 2000, 2003), or as more accurately mapped.

(2) Areas with indications of past landslide activity, such as landslide headscarps and sidescarps, hummocky terrain, areas  with geologic conditions that can promote earth movement, and areas with signs of potential landsliding, such as springs, groundwater seepage, and bowed or backtilted trees.

(3) Areas with topographic expression of runout zones, such as fans and colluvial deposition at the toes of hillsides.

 (4) Setbacks at the top of very steep slopes or bluffs, depending on soil conditions.

~~(b)~~(5)~~Steep s~~Slopes with an incline of forty (40) percent ~~average slope or greater as defined by the Director. A slope must have a vertical elevation change of at least ten (10) feet to be considered a steep slope, although the ten (10) feet may cross the boundaries of a site. Slopes that meet these characteristics shall be considered steep-slope environmentally critical areas in addition to being classified as potential landslide areas;~~or more within a vertical elevation  change of at least ten feet (10').

For the purpose of this definition, a slope is measured by establishing its toe and top and averaging the inclination over at least ten feet feet (10') of elevation difference.

Also for the purpose of this definition:

(a) The "toe" of a slope means a distinct topographic break in slope that separates slopes inclined at less than forty percent (40%) from slopes inclined at forty percent (40%) or more. Where no distinct break exists, the "toe" of a slope is the lower-most limit of the area where the ground surface drops ten feet (10') or more vertically within a horizontal distance of twenty-five feet (25'); and

(b) The "top" of a slope is a distinct topographic break in slope that separates slopes inclined at less than forty percent (40%) from slopes inclined at forty percent (40%) or more. Where no distinct break exists, the "top" of a slope is the upper- most limit of the area where the ground surface drops ten feet (10') or more vertically within a horizontal distance of twenty-five feet (25').

~~(e)~~(6) Areas that would be covered under ~~either (a) or (b)~~one of subsections (2) to (5), but where the topography has been previously modified through the provision of retaining walls or non-engineered cut and fill operations;

~~d~~(7) Any slope area potentially unstable as a result of rapid stream incision or stream bank erosion.

~~b. Liquefaction-prone Areas. Liquefaction-prone areas are areas underlain by cohesionless soils of low density usually in association with a shallow groundwater table which lose substantial strength during earthquakes.~~

 4. Steep Slope Areas. Steep slope areas are areas with a slope described in subsection A3b(5) above; provided that the area is only a landslide prone area when such a slope is on a parcel in a Downtown zone or highrise zone.  5. There is a known risk from a seismic events in Seattle and the surrounding region. Subsection 1-4 identify areas that constitute a particularly high risk to safety and welfare from such events and are therefore regulated as environmentally critical areas. The risks associated with seismic hazards in the remainder of the City are regulated by the Building Code (SMC Title 22) and not by this Ordinance.

~~2~~B. Flood-prone Areas. Flood-prone areas are those areas that would likely be covered with or carry water as a result of a one hundred (100) year flood event~~storm~~, or that would have a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being covered with or of carrying water in any given year based on current circumstances or maximum development permitted under existing zoning. This includes areas identified as flood-prone on the Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance or on FEMA maps, and streams identified by the Washington State Department of Fisheries Catalog of Washington Streams, and areas with ~~drainage~~stormwater runoff problems known to ~~the~~ Seattle ~~Drainage and Wastewater Utility.~~Public Utilities.

~~3. Riparian Corridors. Riparian corridors include all areas within one hundred (100) feet measured horizontally from the top of the bank, or if that cannot be determined, from the ordinary high water mark of the watercourse and water body, or a one-hundred (100) year floodplain as mapped by FEMA, as regulated by the Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance, whichever is greater, and are classified as either a Class A Riparian Corridor or a Class B Riparian Corridor. Class A Riparian Corridors are stable, established streams and lakes that flow year-round and/or support salmonids, and include, but are not limited to, corridors that have an established floodplain as mapped by the FEMA Flood Insurance Program, and include Longfellow, Thornton, Pipers, Venema, Mohlendorph, Fauntleroy, Ravenna, Mapes, DeadHorse/Mill, Maple Leaf and Little Brook Creeks, and Haller and Bitter Lakes. Class B Riparian Corridors are not mapped by FEMA and are intermittent streams without salmonids that still demonstrate a high water mark. Riparian corridors do not normally include those artificial drainage areas intentionally created from grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, and landscape amenities.~~

~~4~~C. Wetlands. Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and stormwater ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands ~~may~~ include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate conversion of wetlands. The method for delineating wetlands shall follow ~~the most current version of~~ the "Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual" as adopted by the State Department of Ecology (Publication #96-94.)

~~5~~D. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas. The following are~~F~~fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas ~~include, but are not limited to, the following~~:

1. Areas mapped by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife ("WDFW") as urban natural open space habitat areas.

~~a~~2. Areas designated~~identified~~ by ~~the Washington State Department of Wildlife~~WDFW as priority habitats and species areas, including native eel grass beds, kelp beds, and recreational shellfish areas.~~or urban natural open space habitat areas;~~

~~(1)~~3. Corridors connecting ~~other~~ priority habitatsand species areas or habitat areas for species of local importance meeting one of the following criteria:~~especially areas that would otherwise be isolated;~~

a. WDFW or the Department's species habitat management plan identifies the parcel as part of a corridor connecting habitat areas for priority species or species of local importance;

b. the parcel is adjacent to or connects parcels containing priority species or species of local importance and the Director determines that the parcel is part of a wildlife corridor based on information provided by a qualified wildlife biologist or;  c. the parcel provides fish passage between fish habitat in Type 1-5 waters upstream and downstream of the parcel, whether that passage is in riparian watercourses, pipes or culverts.

~~(2) Areas that remain an isolated remnant of natural habitat of ten (10) acres or more and surrounded by urban development, with local consideration given to areas smaller than ten (10) acres;~~

~~b. All bodies of water that provide migration corridors and habitat for fish, especially salmonids, including Lake Washington, Lake Union and the Lake Washington Ship Canal, Duwamish River , and that portion of Elliot Bay within the City's jurisdiction;~~

~~c~~~~Commercial and~~~~Recreational shellfish areas and kelp and eelgrass beds and~~

~~d~~4. Areas ~~which~~that provide habitat for species of local importance.

5.a Riparian corridors, which are the riparian watercourse and the riparian management area. The riparian watercourse is the watercourse of Type 2-5 waters defined in WAC 222-16-031 that have fish or wildlife habitat. Water in surface water ditches and stormwater conveyances, pipes, culverts, flow control facilities and water quality facilities are not regulated as riparian watercourses. The riparian management area is the area within one hundred (100) feet (100') measured horizontally landward from the top of each bank of the watercourse, or from the ordinary high water mark of the watercourse as surveyed in the field, if the top of the bank cannot be determined. In watercourses with braided channels or alluvial fans, the ordinary high water mark shall be determined so as to include the entire stream feature.

b. When a pipe or culvert connecting Type 1-5 waters that have fish habitat downstream and upstream from the pipe or culvert is daylighted, the waters formerly in the pipe or culvert will be regulated as a riparian watercourse, and the area adjacent to that watercourse will be regulated as a riparian management area, as defined in subsection 5. This subsection 5b does not apply when the pipe or culvert is removed to provide a publicly-owned facility designed primarily for water quality treatment, flow control or stormwater conveyance.

6. Shoreline habitat, which is Type 1 waters, defined in WAC 222-16-031, that provide migration corridors for fish listed by WDFW as a priority species waterward of the ordinary high water mark.~~6~~E. Abandoned Landfills. Abandoned landfills include those abandoned solid waste landfills identified by the Seattle-King County Health Department in their 1986 Abandoned Landfill Toxicity/Hazard Assessment Project, additional sites identified by public or historical research, and areas within one thousand (1,000) feet (1,000') of methane-producing landfills.

~~C. Environmentally Critical Areas Maps. Environmentally critical areas defined and identified in subsections A and B shall be mapped whenever possible. These maps shall be advisory and used by the Director to provide guidance in determining applicability of the standards to a property. Sites that include environmentally critical areas which are not mapped shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.~~

~~The Director may update or amend the environmentally critical areas maps by Director's Rule, according to Seattle Municipal Code Chapters 3.02 and 3.06, as new information and improved mapping resources become available. Mapping amendments may occur at a frequency not to exceed once every year.~~

25.09.030 Location of environmentally critical areas and buffers.

 A. Environmentally critical areas are defined in Section 25.09.020, and buffers are described in Sections 25.09.160, 25.09.180, and 25.09.200B. Environmentally critical areas are mapped whenever possible. These maps are advisory. The Director may update or amend the maps by Director's Rule.

 B. The Director shall determine whether a parcel contains an environmentally critical area or buffer before other provisions of this chapter are applied. In determining whether a parcel contains an environmentally critical area or buffer, the Director may consider the environmentally critical areas maps, site surveys, topographic maps, technical environmental analysis, and any other information the Director determines necessary.

 25.09.040 ~~Application of standards~~Permits and Approvals Required.

~~The standards of this chapter shall apply to all public and private proposals for new structures, additions to structures, short subdivisions and subdivisions, grading and drainage activity, and tree and vegetation removal per Section 25.09.320 located on either public or private property within environmentally critical areas and their buffers. Public projects proposed by any public agency shall comply with the standards of this chapter. Projects shall be exempted from the requirements of the chapter when the following situations and/or conditions apply:~~

A. Prior to undertaking development or platting on a parcel containing an environmentally critical area or buffer, the person responsible shall submit an application complying with the provisions of Section 25.09.330, unless the person complies with the provisions of Section 25.09.045, 25.09.055, or 25.09.320.  B. Prior to undertaking actions under Section 25.09.045, 25.09.055, or 25.09.200 A4, the person responsible shall comply with provisions of the applicable section.

When the new accessory structure or addition to an existing structure is on a lot that is or has been held in common ownership with a contiguous lot and the lots are or have been used for a single principal use or for a principal use and accessory use, the limitation applies to the entire site.

3. It is not possible to build the accessory structure or addition to an existing structure for the intended purpose out of the environmentally critical area or buffer.

4. The location of the accessory structure or addition to an existing structure keeps impact on the environmentally critical area and buffer to a minimum.

5. In landslide-prone areas the Director may require a soils report prepared by a qualified geotechnical engineer or geologist licensed by the State of Washington demonstrates that it is safe to construct the new accessory structure or the addition to an existing structure.

B. Director's Decision.

1. The Director shall require the use of fencing with a highly durable protective barrier during the construction to protect the remainder of the environmentally critical area and/or buffer.  2. The Director shall require planting native vegetation in an area equal in size to the area of any native vegetation in a riparian corridor, wetland buffer, steep slope, or steep slope buffer that is removed or adversely impacted by the development. Any invasive species shall be removed from the planting area. The planting area shall be on site and, whenever possible, in the same environmentally critical area or buffer. When this is not possible, the Director may authorize all or a portion of the planting to be outside the environmentally critical area or buffer or on another parcel, when the Director determines this will mitigate the impact.

3. The Director may require additional measures to protect the remainder of the environmentally critical area and/or buffer.

 25.09.080 ~~Development standards for landslide-prone hazard~~ Landslide-prone critical areas.

 A. ~~Site.~~This section applies to all parcels in or containing a landslide-prone critical area.

B. Site.

1. Complete stabilization of all portions of a site ~~which~~that are disturbed or affected by the proposed development, including all developmental coverage and construction activity areas, ~~shall be~~is required. Complete stabilization of all portions of a site refers to the process and actions necessary to  stabilize~~ensure that~~ proposed site improvements ~~are stabilized~~, and ~~that~~ all on-site areas and adjacent properties, including adjacent public and private rights-of-way, ~~which~~that are disturbed or ~~impacted~~affected~~are stabilized~~.

2. The proposed development ~~or use~~ shall be limited and controlled to avoid adverse impacts and potential harm, and to ~~ensure~~provide safe, stable and compatible development appropriate to site conditions. Other reasonable and appropriate solutions to ~~solve~~provide site stability ~~problems~~ may be required by the Director. This may include imposing conditions concerning the type and method of construction that reflect the specific constraints of the site.  3. Removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to trees or vegetation in landslide prone critical areas is prohibited, except as provided in this section and Section 25.09.320.

~~B. Staged Review Process. Projects proposed in landslide- prone areas shall be subject to a staged review process.~~

~~1. The staged review process may consist of one (1) or more of the following steps:~~

~~a. Site visit and reconnaissance;~~

~~b. Preliminary soils investigations including tests and borings; and~~

~~c. Detailed geotechnical studies and engineering plans.~~

~~2. During the staged review process, more extensive studies and investigations may be required for more hazardous sites, based on the degree of slope, hydrology and underlaying soils and geology. The Director may require detailed site investigation including, but not limited to the following:~~

~~a. Review of available literature regarding the site and surrounding areas;~~

~~b. Detailed topographic analysis;~~

~~c. Subsurface data and exploration logs;~~

~~d. Ground surface profiles;~~

~~e. Analysis of relationship of vegetated cover and slope stability;~~

~~f. Site stability analysis;~~

~~g. Geotechnical considerations to reduce risk; and~~

~~h. Construction and post-construction monitoring.~~

~~3. The Director shall determine the amount of additional study necessary depending on the degree of landslide-prone hazard on a site based on the information disclosed during the staged review process. The Director may require third-party review.~~

~~4. As part of the staged review process, the Director shall provide mailed notice to adjacent property owners, and the applicant shall post one (1) land use sign visible to the public at each street frontage abutting the site except, when there is no street frontage or the site abuts an unimproved street, the Director shall require either more than one (1) sign and/or an alternative posting location so that notice is clearly visible to the public. The land use sign may be removed by the applicant within fourteen (14) days after final action on the application has been completed. The purpose of this notice is to allow for an exchange of information between the applicant, adjacent property owners and the Director. Adjacent property owners may review and comment on site investigations and technical studies, and provide information and documentation of any previous landslide problems on the site. Notice will include information on how to find out whether or not third-party review is required.~~

 C. Third-Party Review. In addition to requiring the information provided pursuant to Section 25.09.330 and to Director's Rules,~~T~~the Director ~~shall determine when~~may require third-party review when the professional opinions of the applicant's representative and the Department's reviewers cannot be reconciled.~~shall be required.~~ Third-party review requires the applicant's geotechnical and/or additional technical studies to be reviewed by an independent third party, paid for by the applicant but hired by the Director. Third-party review shall be conducted by a qualified engineering consultant. ~~In determining the need for third-party review, the Director shall consider whether or not the project is to be constructed on deep soft-soil areas, areas identified as being affected by deep slide masses or block movements, sites with excessive groundwater, and sites subject to lateral ground failure due to earthquakes.~~

 D. Bonds and Insurance. The Director may require adequate bonds and/or insurance to cover potential claims for property damage ~~which~~that may arise from or be related to excavation or fill within a landslide-prone area ~~a. The Director shall require such bonds or insurance~~ when the depth of the proposed excavation ~~shall~~ exceeds four (4) feet (4') and the bottom of the

 proposed excavation ~~shall be~~is below ~~a~~the one hundred percent (100%) slope line (forty-five (45) degrees from a horizontal line) from the property line. The Director may require such bonds and insurance in other circumstances where the Director determines that there is a potential for significant harm to anenvironmentally critical area or buffer during the construction process.

E. Permit renewals.

In addition to complying with the permit renewal standards in Chapter 23.76, applications for permit renewal shall comply with the following standards.

1. The Director may renew a permit for development that is in conformance with applicable regulations in effect at the time the renewal is sought.

2. An applicant seeking to renew a permit for new development in a landslide-prone area must submit a letter of certification from the current project geotechnical engineer of record as described in subsection G2. If such a letter of  certification is not submitted, the permit shall not be renewed.

3. The Director may renew a permit for development in a landslide-prone area if, after considering the information submitted in conformance with subsections G, he or she determines that there is no increased risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to the drainage basin. In making such a determination the Director may impose new conditions or require the submittal of revised plans.

4. An applicant for renewal also must demonstrate that any required bond or insurance will be in effect during the renewal period, and that the amount of such bond or insurance still is appropriate. The Director may require a bond or insurance as a condition of renewal even if such bond or insurance was not required previously.

F. Issued permits in landslide-prone areas. If the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists because significant changes in conditions at a project site or in the surrounding area may have occurred since a permit was issued, increasing the risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to the drainage basin, the Director may by letter or other reasonable means of notification suspend the permit until the applicant has submitted a letter of certification as described in subsection G2 and has satisfied the standards of that section.  G. Letter of Certification.

1. The Director may require a letter of certification based on such factors as the presence of known slides, indications of changed conditions at the site or the surrounding area, or other indications of unstable soils.

 2. The letter of certification shall be from the current project geotechnical engineer of record stating that a geotechnical engineer has inspected the site and area surrounding the proposed development within the sixty (60) days preceding submittal of the letter; and that:

 a. In the project geotechnical engineer's professional opinion no significant changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that render invalid or out-of-date the analysis and recommendations contained in the technical reports and other application materials previously submitted to the Department as part of the application for the permit; or that

 b. In the project geotechnical engineer's professional opinion changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that require revision to project criteria, and that in the project geotechnical engineer's professional opinion all technical reports and any necessary revised drawings that account for the changed conditions have been prepared and submitted.

 25.09.100 Development standards for liquefaction-prone areas.

 A. The general development standards set out in SMC 25.09.060 do not apply to liquefaction prone areas.

B. Soils engineering studies may~~shall~~ be required for~~of all proposed~~ development in ~~areas subject to~~ liquefaction-prone areas to determine the physical properties of the surficial soils, especially the thickness

 of unconsolidated deposits, and their liquefaction potential, as set out in Title 22, Subtitle I.

~~B~~C. If it is determined that the site is subject to liquefaction, mitigation measures may be imposed pursuant to~~appropriate to the scale of the development shall be recommended and implemented through requirements of~~ Title 22, Subtitle ~~VIII~~I, ~~Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance, SMC Title 22, Subtitle I, Building Code, and any~~in addition to other applicable codes or regulations pertaining to development ~~within~~in liquefaction-prone areas.

 25.09.120 Development standards for flood-prone areas.

 A. Development is prohibited within the "floodway" of flood- prone areas. Permitted development within flood-prone areas lying outside the floodway shall not contribute to increased downstream flow of floodwaters and shall comply with the provisions of ~~SMC~~Chapter 25.06, Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance.~~(FEMA) A drainage-control plan shall be required for all proposed development.~~

 B. Drainage-Control Plan. If the site is mapped or determined to be flood-prone, the Director may require a drainage-control plan ~~shall~~to be submitted with the permit application showing the flood-prone area, the tributary watershed, and all drainage features, to describe the existing situation and proposed modifications to the drainage system. If required, the~~The~~ drainage-control plan shall provide for control of water quality and quantity in compliance with ~~the~~ Title 22, Subtitle VIII, Stormwater Grading and Drainage Control ~~Ordinance~~Code, ~~SMC~~Chapter 25.06, Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance, and any other subsequent applicable flood-control codes or ordinances to protect the public interest and prevent harm.

 C. Elevation Above Base Flood Level. The lowest floor elevation of any structure located in a flood-prone area shall be no less than two feet (2') above the one-hundred (100) year flood elevation ~~unless otherwise specified by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities~~.

~~25.09.140 Development standards for riparian corridors.~~

~~A. Riparian Corridor Watercourse. No development shall be permitted within or over the watercourse as delineated by survey and accepted by the Director. If no other access is available to the property, the Director may approve access over the watercourse as long as it maintains the natural channel and floodway of the watercourse and minimizes the disturbance of the buffer to the greatest extent possible.~~

~~B. Minimum Riparian Corridor Buffer. In order to prevent harm on-site and downstream, and in order to minimize degradation of water quality, a buffer shall be established within the corridor within which development shall not be permitted. All buffers shall be measured horizontally from the top of the bank, or if that cannot be determined, from the ordinary high water mark as surveyed in the field. In cases with braided channels and alluvial fans, the top of the ordinary high water mark shall be determined so as to include the entire stream feature. The buffer shall not extend beyond an existing public road if the road has an adequate storm water catchment facility. The minimum buffer shall be as follows:~~

~~1. Class A Riparian Corridor Buffers; Fifty Feet (50'); and~~

~~2. Class B Riparian Corridor Buffers; Twenty-five feet (25').~~

~~C. Buffer Vegetation and Restoration.~~

~~1. Natural Buffer. If the vegetation within the buffer is generally in a natural state that prevents erosion, protects water quality, and provides a diverse habitat, the retention of the buffer's existing vegetation shall be required.~~

~~2. Buffer Restoration. If the vegetation within the buffer has been previously disturbed or degraded, the preparation of a plan to enhance the buffer through replanting or augmenting the existing vegetation with native or similar plants may be required by the Director. Any revegetation plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional with landscaping, plant ecology, or botany education and experience. The plan shall be approved by the Director. Vegetation shall not be removed or otherwise disturbed until the applicant is ready to replant immediately.~~

~~3. Buffer Restoration Exemption. When the site is a single lot, located adjacent to properties where natural vegetation has already been removed for lawns or other residential activities, the Director may conclude that a buffer restoration plan is not to be required or that buffer restoration is limited to planting trees for creek shading when no significant increase in protection of the water body would result from full restoration of the buffer.~~

~~D. Buffer Reductions on Existing Lots. The Director may reduce a Class A buffer if development of adjacent lots is less than fifty feet (50') from the watercourse. However, the buffer shall not be less than the distance to the watercourse from the adjacent structure that is furthest from the watercourse, or less than twenty- five feet (25'), whichever is greater.~~

~~E. Riparian Corridor Restoration.~~

~~1. To encourage restoration of a riparian corridor presently located in an underground pipe or culvert, the following conditions shall apply:~~

~~a. Every effort shall be made to avoid building over a riparian corridor located in an underground pipe or culvert, except when located under a street right-of-way; and~~

~~b. Uncovering of the riparian corridor should be encouraged and allowed with the Director's approval of the following exceptions to riparian corridor standards:~~

~~i. The minimum buffer may not be required if there is no space available; and~~

~~ii. The open riparian corridor may be located elsewhere on-site or on adjacent sites.~~

~~2. To encourage restoration of a riparian corridor presently located in an open channel or drainage-way, the Director may waive the minimum buffer.~~

~~F. More intensive site review and application of stricter development standards may be applied in areas outside of the riparian corridor buffer where any of the following conditions are present:~~

~~1. High, steep slopes that could produce debris slides directly to surface waters; or~~

~~2. Sites with polluted groundwater seeps or springs; or~~

~~3. Other areas of potentially extreme adverse impacts.~~

~~G. Other Agency Regulations. Review of projects subject to the riparian corridor provisions of this chapter shall be coordinated with the Washington State Departments of Fisheries or Wildlife when hydraulic project approval is required, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when they have jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. The applicant shall be encouraged to make early contact with these agencies to ensure compliance with local, state and federal riparian corridor regulations.~~

 25.09.160 Development standards for wetlands.

~~A. Wetland. Wetland provisions of this chapter shall apply only to wetlands of one hundred (100) square feet or greater in area, unless a smaller wetland or a combination of adjacent, smaller wetlands are part of a larger drainage system. No grading, filling, draining and/or development shall be permitted within or over a wetland of exceptional value and its buffer as delineated by a survey accepted by the Director. Grading, filling, draining and/or development within wetlands and their buffers, other than wetlands of exceptional value, shall only be allowed under the following limited situations and conditions:~~

~~1. Wetlands altered for use as lawns or playfields prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be regulated as wetlands unless the Director determines that the wetland could be restored when new development or redevelopment occurs on the site; and~~

A. Wetlands are rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Ecology Publication #04-06-25). Illegal grading, filling, draining, or other development will not result in a change to that wetland's rating. Wetlands constructed for mitigation or replacement purposes are subject to the provisions of this chapter.

B. Impacts to Wetlands.

1. Development, including but not limited to grading, filling, or draining, is prohibited within or over: a Category I, II or III wetland, a Category IV wetland one thousand (1,000) square feet or more in total size, and a Category IV wetland less than one thousand (1,000) square feet in total size that is part of a larger wetland system  a.

~~a. Restoration of an existing degraded wetland, or~~

~~b. Creation of additional substitute wetlands, although the Director shall give preference to restoration, and~~

~~c. Restoration of an existing degraded wetland or~~creation of substitute wetlands shall meet the following conditions:

~~i. The applicant shall fund the wetland restoration or creation under the direction and authority of the Director,~~

~~ii. To the greatest extent practical, restoration or creation may occur either on or off site, but within the same drainage basin,~~

~~iii. Restoration or creation shall be of a similar type and shall take place before alteration of the original wetland,~~

~~iv. Restoration or creation shall require the original wetland to be replaced at a ratio of two to one (2:1), and~~

~~v. The restored or substitute wetland shall provide comparable water- quality benefits and be of at least equal habitat and hydrologic value.~~

~~B~~C. Wetland Buffers and Mitigation. ~~In order to protect wetland areas and maintain water quality, a minimum wetland buffer of fifty feet (50') shall be established within which no development shall be permitted and all vegetation shall remain undisturbed. The wetland buffer shall be measured horizontally from the edge of the wetland.~~

1. Establishment of buffers.

a. The wetland buffer is measured horizontally from the edge of the wetland.

b. Wetlands have the following buffers:

Category I and II wetlands over one hundred (100) square feet in total size or of any size with the characteristics described in subsection B1c above 100 feet

Category I and II wetlands over one 100 feet hundred (100) square feet in total 110 feet for moderate size level habitat or of any size with the function characteristics described in 200 feet for high subsection B1c above level of habitat function  Category III wetlands over one 60 feet hundred (100) square feet in total 85 feet for moderate size or greater level or of any size with the habitat function characteristics described in subsection B1c above

 Category IV wetlands one thousand 50 feet (1,000) square feet or more in total size or of any size with the characteristics described in subsection B1c above

 Category IV wetlands under one No buffer. Use thousand (1,000) square feet in mitigation under total size that do not have the subsection C3. characteristics described in subsection B1c above

A wetland with a moderate level of function is one that scores 20 to 28 points for habitat function when rated according to Washington State Ecology publication #04-06-025. A wetland with a high level of function for habitat is one that scores of 29 to 36 points for habitat function when rated according to Washington State Ecology publication #04-06-025.

c.Wetlands constructed in upland areas or non- wetland areas by any person for stormwater control, biofiltration or aesthetic purposes are not subject to the wetland buffer requirements of this chapter. Maintenance activities are not restricted in these types of wetlands.

2. Development is prohibited in wetland buffers, except as approved by the Director under subsection D.

3. The Director may authorize development in a Category IV wetland under one thousand (1,000) square feet that does not have the characteristics described in subsection B1c above, when the Director finds that one of the following measures, which must occur on site, will mitigate wetland function lost by development:  a. Construct a wetland of equal function to the lost wetland function.

 b. Plant an area of native vegetation equal or greater in size to the area of the developed wetland, and remove invasive species in the area to be planted.

 c. Construct a bioengineered/ infiltration facility, such as a bioswale, stormwater planter or infiltration planter, that replicates the hydrologic and/or water quality benefit of the developed wetland. This facility shall be designed according to the requirements of Title 22, Subtitle VIII, Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code.

 d. Construct a eco-roof or roof garden that replicates the hydrologic and/ or water quality benefit of the developed wetland. These facilities shall be designed according to the requirements of Title 22, Subtitle VIII, Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code.

~~C~~4. Buffer Vegetation ~~and Restoration~~.

~~1. Natural Buffer. If the vegetation within the buffer is generally in a natural state that prevents erosion, protects water quality, and provides a diverse habitat, the retention of the buffer's existing vegetation shall be required~~.

a. Removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation in the wetland buffer is prohibited, except as provided in subsection D and Section 25.09.320.

~~2.~~~~Buffer Restoration. If the vegetation within the buffer has been previously disturbed or degraded, the preparation of a plan to enhance the buffer through replanting or augmenting the existing vegetation with native native or similar plants plants may be required by the Director. Any revegetation plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional with landscaping, plant ecology, or botany education and experience. The plan shall be approved by the Director. Vegetation shall not be removed or otherwise disturbed until the applicant is ready to replant immediately~~.

~~3. Buffer Revegetation Exemptions. The Director shall allow the removal by hand of i~~

b. Invasive plants and noxious weeds~~, such as purple loosestrife,~~may be removed by hand. No machines or chemical removal shall be permitted without the Director's approval.

~~E.~~D. Buffer Averaging and Buffer Reductions.

1. Buffer Width Averaging. The Director may modify the standard wetland buffer width by averaging buffer widths when a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that:

a. It will not reduce wetland functions or values;

 b. The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the buffer required in subsection C above; and

 c. The buffer width is not reduced to less than the following:

Category IV wetlands 35 feet  Category III wetlands with a high level 60 feet of function for habitat

 All other Category III wetlands 40 feet

 Category I and II wetlands with a high 140 feet level of function for habitat

 All other Category I and II wetlands 75 feet

A high level of function for habitat shall be determined as set out in Subsection C1 above.

~~D~~2. Buffer Reductions.~~on Existing Lots. Buffer reductions on existing lots may only be allowed after the Director has determined that the front or rear yard or setback reduction or variance provisions of Section 25.09.280 will not provide sufficient relief.~~

a. The Director may reduce a Category IV wetland buffer when the applicant qualifies for a variance by demonstrating that:

(1) the lot where the buffer is located was in existence before October 31, 1992;

(2) the proposed development otherwise meets the criteria for granting a variance under Section 25.09.280B, except that reducing the front or rear yard or setbacks will not both mitigate the hardship and maintain the full buffer; and

(3) either the site does not meet the criteria for buffer averaging under subsection D1 or such averaging does not relieve the hardship that was found under subsection 25.09.280 B2.

b. If any buffer reduction is authorized by a variance under subsection D 2a, the Director shall

(1) require the Category IV wetland to be restored on site in a manner that improves water quality, hydrology and habitat functions. Restoration must comply with subsections F and G below and with the Department of Ecology Guidelines for Developing Freshwater Wetlands Mitigation Plans and Proposals, 1994 (#94-29); and

(2) determine the amount of wetland buffer to reduce by applying the buffer averaging to the extent possible under subsection D1 and reducing the yards and setbacks before reducing the wetland buffer, unless reducing the yards or setbacks is injurious to safety. The wetland buffer shall be reduced by the minimum amount to mitigate the hardship, but never to less than thirty five feet (35');and

(3) impose additional conditions on the location and other features of a proposed development as necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter and to mitigate the loss or reduction of the yard, setback or buffer.

c. The process and procedure for a variance under this subsection D2 shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

~~1. The Director may reduce a wetland buffer on existing lots only if the front or rear yard or setback reduction provision of Section 25.09.280 A does not provide sufficient relief to allow placement of an adequate structure and maintain the full width of the required wetland buffer.~~

~~2. The Director may further reduce a front or rear yard or setback through an Environmentally Critical Areas Yard or Setback Reduction Variance pursuant to the provisions of Section 25.09.280 B. If, during the review of this variance, the analysis shows that additional front or rear yard or setback reductions would not meet the criteria for variance approval and/or would not provide sufficient relief to allow placement of an adequate structure and maintain the full wetland buffer requirement, the Director may either approve reduction of the wetland buffer only or reduction of both yards or setbacks and the wetland buffer. The wetland buffer reduction shall be the minimum amount necessary, but never less than the twenty-five-foot (25') minimum buffer, to provide for use of the property and to prevent harm to the wetland.~~

~~3. The Director may reduce a wetland buffer only for wetlands which are determined to be degraded under the following circumstances:~~

~~a. If the degraded portion of the wetland is restored on site at a four to one (4:1) ratio, restored land area to reduced buffer, for wetlands larger than fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet; and at a two to one (2:1) ratio for wetlands under fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet; and~~

~~b. Such buffer reduction adjacent to the degraded wetland shall not result in a buffer of less than twenty-five feet (25') and does not apply to the wetland itself.~~

~~E~~~~Constructed Wetlands. Wetlands constructed by a private interest or public agency for stormwater control, biofiltration or aesthetic purposes shall not be subject to the wetland buffer requirements of this chapter. Maintenance activities shall not be restricted. This does not apply to wetlands constructed for mitigation or replacement purposes.~~

E. Avoidance and Mitigation Standards.

1. The standards for wetland mitigation shall be applied in following order of priority:

a. avoid the impact to the extent practicable by not taking all or part of an action;

b. keep the impact to a minimum by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, and by taking affirmative actions to mitigate the impact over time; and

c. mitigate unavoidable impacts to the designated uses of a wetland by replacement, enhancement, or other approved compensation methods.

2. Mitigation for grading, filling, or draining wetlands shall achieve the equivalent or better biologic functions of the existing wetland. Mitigation plans shall be consistent with the Department of Ecology Guidelines for Developing Freshwater Wetlands Mitigation Plans and Proposals, 1994 (#94-29).

3. Wetland mitigation actions shall not result in a net loss of wetland area unless the following criteria are met as determined by a site-specific function assessment:

a. The lost wetland area provides only minimal functions and the mitigation action(s) results in a net gain in wetland functions; or

b. The lost wetland area provides only minimal functions and other replacement areas provide greater benefits to the functioning of the watershed, such as riparian habitat restoration and enhancement.

4. Mitigation actions that require compensation by replacing, enhancing, or substitution, shall occur in the following order of preference:

a. Restoring wetlands on sites that were formerly wetlands.

b. Creating wetlands on disturbed sites, such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of exotic introduced species.

c. Enhancing wetlands and/or wetland buffers with significantly degraded functions and values. The amount of required enhancement is dependent on the wetland classification in subsection 5.

 5. a. The following ratios are required for the restoration, creation or enhancement of wetlands for authorized alterations. As determined by the Director, wetland mitigation may include the preservation and enhancement of habitat if it provides greater ecological function than the existing wetland. The first number specifies the area of replacement wetlands, and second specifies the area of wetlands altered:

Restoration or Creation Enhancement Ratios Ratios  Category I 6:1 16:1

 Category II 3:1 16:1

 Category III 2:1 8:1

 Category IV 1.5:1 6:1

b. Replacement ratios may be increased under the following circumstances to achieve the equivalent wetland function of the wetland that is altered:

(1) Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation; or

(2) A significant period of time will elapse between impact and establishment of wetland functions at the mitigation site; or

(3) Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted.

c. Replacement ratios may be decreased when the proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and result in no net loss in wetland functions.

F. Mitigation Timing. Any restoration, creation or enhancement of wetlands that is required as mitigation shall be completed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the displacing use. If that has not occurred or if no certificate of occupancy is needed, the applicant shall submit plans that establish a specific schedule for completion, which must be approved by the Director, and shall provide a bond of at least one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the cost of installation, in addition to the monitoring plan and bond required under subsection G. If the required mitigation can be completed for less than five thousand dollars ($5,000), no bond is required under subsection F or G.

G. A monitoring plan shall be prepared to monitor successful re-establishment of the wetland for a period of five growing seasons or the period required to achieve the performance standards of the plan, whichever is earlier. The applicant shall provide a bond in an amount of at least one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the cost to retain a qualified wetlands scientist to assess the wetland and submit a report to the City at least twice yearly, prior to and near the end of each growing season and shall also provide a bond in an amount sufficient to implement additional restoration measures if the replacement wetland does not equal the functions of the wetland displaced at the end of five growing seasons.

~~F~~H. Other Agency Regulations. Review of projects subject to the wetland provisions of this chapter shall be coordinated by the applicant with the appropriate state and federal agencies.~~Washington State Departments of Fisheries or Wildlife when hydraulic project approval is required, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when they have jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act~~ The applicant ~~shall be encouraged to~~should make early contact with these agencies to ensure compliance with local, state and federal ~~riparian corridor~~regulations.

 I. In addition the information provided pursuant to Section 25.09.330 and to Director's Rule, the Director may require third-party review when the professional opinions of the applicant's representative and the Department's reviewers cannot be reconciled. The third party review will be conducted by a qualified wetland consultant hired by the Director and paid for by the applicant.

 25.09.180 Development standards for steep slope~~s~~ areas.

A. This section and Section 25.09.080 apply to parcels containing a steep slope area or buffer.

 B. ~~A. Development Limitations on Steep Slopes and Buffers on Existing Lots~~Impacts on Steep Slope Areas.

 1. Development ~~shall be avoided on areas over forty percent (40%) slope whenever possible~~is prohibited on steep slope areas, unless the applicant demonstrates that the provisions of subsections B2 or E apply.

 2. ~~Generally, the Director shall require a~~Provided that all the provisions of this chapter and all applicable provisions of Title 23 and Title 22, Subtitle VIII, are met, the development standards in subsection B 1 do not apply when the applicant demonstrates the development meets one of the following criteria. In determining whether these criteria are met, the Director may require a geotechnical report to verify site conditions and to evaluate the impacts of the development in the steep slope area and shall require such a report for criteria (c) and (d). The geotechnical report is subject to the provisions for third party review in Section 25.09.080 C.

a. Development is located where existing development is located, if the impact on the steep slope area is not altered or increased; or

b. Development is located on steep slope areas that have been created through previous legal grading activities, including rockeries or retaining walls resulting from rights of way improvements, if no adverse impact on the steep slope area will result; or

c. Development is located on steep slope areas that are less than feet (20') in vertical rise and that are thirty feet (30') or more from other steep slope areas, if no adverse impact on the steep slope area will result; or

d. Development is located on steep slope areas where the  Director determines that application of the development standards in subsection B1 would prevent necessary stabilization of a landslide-prone area.

C. Buffers.

1. Steep slopes have fifteen-foot (15') buffers

 from the top ~~or~~and toe of a slope unless the Director determines~~whenever practicable~~that a greater or lesser buffer is required~~based on geotechnical and hydrological site constraints and the impacts of proposed construction methods on the stability of the slope, increased erosion potential, and disruption of existing topography and vegetation. The width of the buffer may be increased or decreased as determined by the Director~~ based on the following considerations:

 a. Proposed construction method and its effect on the stability of the slope and ~~increased~~ erosion potential;

 b. Techniques used to ~~minimize~~keep the disruption of existing topography and vegetation to a minimum; and

 c. Preparation of technical reports and plans to address and propose remedies regarding soils and hydrology site constraints.

 ********************************

2. Development is prohibited on steep slope area buffers, except as authorized in subsection B2 or to provide access to such an area, which shall be kept to a minimum, and except as provided in subsection E.

~~3. When it is not practicable to avoid development on areas over forty percent (40%) slope and the buffer area, the following conditions shall apply:~~

~~a. Grading and development activity and other land disturbing activity shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the areas measured over forty percent (40%) slope. This shall not include vegetation removal for the purposes of replacing existing vegetation with more suitable plants; and~~

~~b. The Director may impose conditions concerning the type and method of construction that reflect the specific constraints of the site, as well as the landslide-prone area regulations of this chapter, Section 25.09.080 A.~~

~~B. Vegetation Removal and Replanting. Removal of vegetation in steep-slope areas shall be minimized. Any replanting that occurs shall consist of trees, shrubs, and ground cover that is compatible with the existing surrounding vegetation, meets the objectives of erosion prevention and site stabilization, and does not require permanent irrigation for long-term survival.~~

D. Vegetation Removal and Replanting. If removal of trees or vegetation in a steep slope area and its buffer is authorized as part of approved development, it shall be kept to a minimum, and shall be carried out pursuant to a tree and revegetation plan described in section 25.09.320. Other removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to trees or vegetation in a steep slope area or buffer is prohibited, except as provided in Section 25.09.320. In addition to complying with Section 25.09.320, any replanting that occurs shall consist of plants native to the Pacific Northwest and vegetationappropriate for the site conditions.

~~C. Site Design Guidelines. The following guidelines shall be followed for development in steep-slope areas:~~

~~1. Structures should be designed and placed on the hillside to minimize negative impacts, such as grading and land disturbing activity;~~

~~2. Driveways and utility corridors should be minimized through the use of common access drives and corridors where feasible. Roads, walkways, and parking areas should be designed parallel to topographic contours with consideration given to maintaining consolidated areas of natural topography and vegetation. Access should be located in a way that minimizes impacts to steep slopes or other critical areas;~~

~~3. Development should be located on the least sensitive portion of the site to preserve the natural land forms, geological features, and vegetation;~~

~~4. Terracing of land shall be kept to a minimum; and~~

~~5. Cluster development may be allowed pursuant to the provisions of Section 25.09.260 to emphasize the existing topography and conserve existing resources if compatible with the surrounding residential character.~~

~~D. Steep Slope Exemptions.~~

~~1. Highly Developed Areas. Existing lots, short subdivisions and subdivisions may be exempted by the Director from steep slope regulations when located in highly developed and urbanized areas. Highly developed and urbanized areas include all Downtown and Highrise zones. Sites located in Midrise and Commercial 1 and 2 zones may also qualify for this exemption when surrounding lots contain high-density residential development and/or concentrated commercial development which closely matches the development potential for the zone. This exemption shall not apply to single-family, lowrise, neighborhood commercial, industrial, or any other zones. If the site is characterized by or adjacent to at least one (1) of the following areas, this exemption shall not apply:~~

~~a. A wetland over one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet in size, or a stream or creek designated as a riparian corridor;~~

~~b. A large undeveloped steep-slope system; or~~

~~c. Areas designated by the Washington Department of Wildlife as urban natural open space habitat areas or other large areas with significant tree cover that provides valuable wildlife habitat.~~

~~2. Steep Slopes Resulting from Rights-of-way Improvements. Steep slopes resulting from street, alley, sidewalk and other typical rights-of-way improvements, including rockeries or retaining walls, may be exempted from compliance with the environmentally critical areas regulations. This exemption shall not extend beyond the cut or fill created by the street, alley, sidewalk or other rights-of-way improvement, and does not release the applicant from any applicable geotechnical review requirements under the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Code. This exemption shall not be allowed for short subdivision or subdivision applications.~~

~~3. Previously Developed Sites. Sites that have been previously developed may be exempted by the Director from steep-slope requirements under the following conditions:~~

~~a. If the objectives of the steep slope regulations would not be compromised; and~~

~~b. If the degree of nonconformity with the environmentally critical areas regulations, if applicable, is not increased. This exemption shall not be allowed for short subdivision or subdivision applications.~~

~~4. Limited Exemptions. Slopes with a vertical elevation change of up to twenty feet (20') and not part of a larger steep-slope system, or slopes which have been created through previous, legal grading activities, may be exempted by the Director from the steep-slopes regulations based on a geotechnical report demonstrating that no adverse impact will result from the exemption.~~

~~5. Stabilization of Landslide-prone Area. Certain steep slopes may be exempted from the steep slope regulations upon the Director's determination, based on geotechnical expertise, that application of the regulations would prevent necessary stabilization of a landslide-prone area, subject to the provisions of Section 25.09.080 C, Third- party Review.~~

~~6. Any project receiving an exemption shall be subject to steep-slope drainage control and vegetation removal regulations, as well as applicable landslide-prone area regulations of this chapter.~~

E. 1. Steep Slope Area Variance. The Director may reduce the steep slope area buffer and may authorize limited intrusion into the steep slope area and steep slope buffer to the extent allowed in subsection E2 only when the applicant qualifies for a variance by demonstrating that:

a. the lot where the steep slope or steep slope buffer is located was in existence before October 31, 1992; and

b. the proposed development otherwise meets the criteria for granting a variance under Section 25.09.280B, except that reducing the front or rear yard or setbacks will not both mitigate the hardship and maintain the full steep slope area buffer.

2. If any buffer reduction or development in the critical area is authorized by a variance under subsection E1, it shall be the minimum to afford relief from the hardship and shall be in the following sequence of priority:

a. reduce the yards and setbacks, to the extent reducing the yards or setbacks is not injurious to safety;

b. reduce the steep slope area buffer;

c. allow an intrusion into not more than thirty percent  (30%) of the steep slope area.

3. The Director may impose additional conditions on the location and other features of the proposed development as necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter and mitigate the reduction or loss of the yard, setback, or steep slope area or buffer.

4. The process and procedures for a variance under this subsection E shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

 25.09.200 Development standards for fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.

~~The characteristics of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be used to evaluate development within wetlands, riparian corridors and steep slopes. Preserving the integrity of fish and~~wildlife habitat corridors, and minimizing the intrusion of development into these designated habitat areas shall be considered in applications for buffer reductions and conditional use permits to transfer development credit to noncritical portions of a site.

A. Development standards for parcels with riparian corridors.

1.a The provisions of this subsection A apply to all development on parcels containing riparian corridors as defined in Section 25.09.020 D5. In addition, the provisions of subsection C apply to these parcels, except subsection C2 with respect to fish. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of subsection C and this section, the most restrictive provision applies.  b. It is the long term goal of the City to restore the City's riparian corridors and to protect salmon passage in such corridors where scientifically justified. The City has determined that best available science supports protecting these riparian corridors as described in this chapter. Where past development has encroached into riparian corridors, redevelopment shall be regulated subject to the provisions in Section 25.09.045.

2. Riparian Watercourse.

a. Development is prohibited within or over the watercourse, except as provided in subsection A2b. If no other access is available to the property, the Director may approve access over the watercourse, provided that it maintains the natural channel and floodway of the watercourse and that disturbance of the riparian management area is kept to a minimum.

b. On Haller and Bitter Lakes, piers are regulated pursuant to the development standards for similar structures in the Seattle Shoreline Master Program, Chapter 23.60, Part X, The Urban Residential Environment. If a pier is allowed, access to it through the riparian management area is also allowed, provided the impact on the naturally functioning condition of the riparian management area from the pier's location, method of construction, and construction materials is kept to a minimum.

c. Removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation in the riparian watercourse is prohibited, except as provided in Section 25.09.320.

3. Riparian Management Area.

a. The riparian management area is defined in subsection 25.09.020 D5. Existing public or private streets are excluded from the regulations for the riparian management area, provided that if the provisions of Title 22, Subtitle VIII, the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code apply, the Director shall require adequate stormwater detention to prevent harm from the street to habitat on the parcel and downstream and to keep degradation of water quality for habitat to a minimum.

b. Activities in the riparian management area.

(1) Development is prohibited in the riparian management area, except to provide access to development approved under subsection A2 and except under subsections A3b(2), A3c, and A3d.

(2) Removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation in the riparian management area is prohibited, except as provided in subsection c below and Section 25.09.320.

c. Riparian Management Area Vegetation.

(1) If the vegetation in the riparian management area protects the fish habitat and wildlife habitat as they exist on the site at the time development is proposed, including preventing erosion and protecting water quality, the existing vegetation shall remain undisturbed, except as allowed under Section 25.09.320.

(2) If the riparian management area is not functioning in the manner set out in subsection A3c(1) above, the applicant shall prepare and carry out a tree and vegetation plan that augments the existing vegetation with native vegetation to the extent commensurate with the impact of the development on the riparian management area. The plan shall be prepared and executed consistent with Section 25.09.320. Vegetation in the riparian management area shall not be removed or otherwise disturbed until the applicant is ready to immediately replant according to the approved plan. A monitoring plan shall be prepared to monitor the establishment of the vegetation. The plan shall cover five (5) growing seasons or the period needed to successfully carry out the plan, whichever is earlier.

d. In addition to subsections A3b(2) and A3c, development is allowed in the riparian management area on lots existing at the time this ordinance takes effect if the applicant demonstrates that:

(1) the development is in the limited riparian development area, which is the area in the riparian corridor but outside of the watercourse and more than seventy-five feet (75') from the top of the watercourse bank for Type 2 and 3 waters with anadromous fish present for any part of the year, fifty feet (50') from the top of the watercourse bank for Type 2 and 3 waters where anadromous fish are not present for any part of the year and more than fifty feet (50') from the top of the watercourse bank for Type 4 and 5 waters;

(2) the development complies with Section 22.802.016, regardless of the area of land disturbing activity or the size of the addition or replacement of impervious surface, except as provided in subsection 3e; and

(3) any development, including but not limited to coverage by impervious surface, does not exceed 35% of the total area of the limited riparian development area, provided that the maximum lot coverage does not exceed that allowed under Title 23, and except as provided in subsection 3e.

e. When compliance with Section 22.802.016 is required solely based on subsection 3d(2) above, the Director may approve a restoration plan in lieu of requiring compliance with subsections 3d(2) and (3) if the applicant demonstrates that the plan meets the following criteria:

(1) The watercourse or riparian management area function will be restored so that it prevents erosion, protects water quality, and provides diverse habitat; and

(2) The restoration results in greater protection of the watercourse and riparian management area than compliance with subsections 3d(2) and (3).  4. Daylighting Water in Pipes and Culverts.

 a. Pursuant to Section 25.09.200 D, the Director may require daylighting pipes and culverts that meet the definition of fish and wildlife corridors in Section 25.09.020 D3c.

 b. The City encourages daylighting pipes and culverts connecting Type 1-5 waters that have fish habitat downstream and upstream from the pipe or culvert, and the Director is authorized to modify development standards as set out in subsection 4c

~~b~~ below when the applicant submits a plan for daylighting such a pipe or culvert that meets the following criteria:

 (1) the plan is prepared by a qualified professional;

 (2) the ecological functions of the daylighted waters and adjacent area are improved so the new riparian corridor area is compatible with and protects the ecological functions of the existing riparian corridor upstream and downstream and does not contribute to flooding; ecological functions include preventing erosion, protecting water quality, and providing diverse habitat; and

 (3) if the plan proposes daylighting the pipe or culvert in a different location on the parcel from its current location or off the parcel, the ecological functions required in subsection (2) above are provided as effectively as they would be without the relocation.

 c. If the Director finds the conditions in subsection 4b are met, the Director may modify the following development standards. The modification shall be the minimum to provide sufficient area to meet the standards in subsection 4b and shall be in the following order of priority:

 (1) Yard and/or setback requirements on the property may be reduced, unless reducing them is injurious to safety.

 (2) The riparian corridor watercourse and adjacent area maintained as a riparian management area under the approved plan may count toward open space requirements for all multifamily or commercial zone requirements.

 (3) Required parking may be reduced up to twenty five percent (25%).

 (4) The riparian management area may be reduced.

 d. Nothing

in this subsection alters the rights of the owner of the pipe or culvert, if that person is not an applicant for a permit.

5. Other Agency Regulations. Review of projects subject to the riparian corridor provisions of this chapter shall be coordinated with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife when hydraulic project approval is required, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when they have jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. The applicant is encouraged to make early contact with these agencies to ensure compliance with local, state and federal riparian corridor regulations.

B. Development Standards for Shoreline Habitat.

1. The provisions of this subsection B apply to all parcels with shoreline habitat defined in subsection 25.09.020 D6 or its buffer.

2. In addition, the provisions of subsection C below apply to parcels with shoreline habitat or its buffer, except subsection C2 with respect to fish. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of this subsection B and subsection C, the provision most protective of wildlife habitat applies.

3. Development is prohibited in shoreline habitat, except when all of the following criteria are met:

a. The development is allowed under Title 23, including chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

b. Mitigation is provided for all impacts to the ecological functions of fish habitat on the parcel resulting from any permitted increase in or alteration of existing overwater coverage.

4. Buffers.

a. Shoreline habitat has a one hundred foot (100') buffer from the ordinary high water mark.

b. Bioengineered solutions, such as using plants or other approved natural material, to stabilize the shoreline are allowed in the buffer, provided they are allowed under Title 23, including chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program.

c. Other development for water dependent and water related uses is prohibited in the buffer, except when:  (1) The development is allowed under Title 23, including chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

 (2) no vegetation is removed, the amount of impervious surface is not increased, and no surface that is permeable by water at the time of the application will be covered with an impervious surface so that impervious surface will be closer to the ordinary high water mark; or

 (3) if any of the actions described in

 subsection c(2) above occur and that action impacts the ecologic function of the shoreline, those impacts are mitigated as set out in subsection e below.

If the standards in subsections c(1) and (2) are met, then the application is not subject to the application submittal requirements in Section 25.09.330 and the general development standards in Section 25.09.060.

d. Other development for non-water dependent and non-water related uses is prohibited in the buffer, except when:

 (a) the lot was in existence before the effective date of this ordinance; and

(b) the development is twenty five feet (25') or more from the ordinary high water mark unless the development is allowed in the shoreline habitat under Title 23, including chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

(c) (i)no vegetation is removed, impervious surface is not increased and no net loss of ecological function of the critical area or buffer from other actions occurs; or

(ii) if any of the actions described in subsection d(2)(c)(i) above occur, all impacts on the ecological function are mitigated as set out in subsection e below; or

(3) for residential uses the residence is twenty five feet (25') or more from the ordinary high water mark

(a) and no vegetation is removed, impervious surface is not increased and no net loss of ecological function of the critical area or buffer from other actions occurs; or

(b) if any of the actions described in subsection d(3)(a) above occur, all impacts on the ecological function are mitigated as set out in subsection e below.  e. Mitigation.

(1) Mitigation must prevent net loss of ecological function. Mitigation must achieve the equivalent ecologic functions as the conditions existing in the shoreline habitat buffer at the time of development. Mitigation under this section is not intended to duplicate mitigation for the same ecologic function that is required under other City regulations or under state and federal permits. The permit condition most protective of the ecologic function shall be enforced.

(2) For the purpose of this section, mitigation is action that replaces ecological functions lost as a result of a project impact. Depending on the type of lost ecological function these include:  (a) providing habitat, or

 (b) creating new pervious ground or

 (c) replicates the function of the pervious ground through methods that are engineered and designed according to the requirements of Title 22, Subtitle VIII, Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code.

 (3) Mitigation for habitat impacts in the buffer shall occur in the following order of preference:

(a) on the parcel within the buffer as close to the ordinary high water mark as possible;

(b) within the buffer as close to the ordinary high water mark as possible on a parcel that abuts the ordinary high watermark within one quarter (1/4) mile along the shoreline from where the vegetation removal, placement of impervious surface or other loss of habitat occurred;

(c) farther along the shoreline within the buffer as close to the ordinary high water mark as possible.

(4) The following mitigation ratios are required for habitat impacts in the buffer under subsection 2(a) and 2(b); the first number specifies the area of replacement habitat, and second specifies the area of altered habitat:

(a) 1:1 for areas on the parcel or on a parcel that abuts the ordinary high water mark within one quarter (1/4) mile along the shoreline from where the vegetation removal, placement of impervious surface or other loss of habitat occurred. If the applicant demonstrates that the ecological function can be replaced at a different ratio, the Director may approve that ratio.

(b) 3:1 farther along the shoreline, provided that if a five (5) year bonded monitoring program is provided that monitors the effectiveness of mitigation measures and provides a means for ensuring the attainment of the goals of the program, the Director may approve a 2:1 ratio.

5. Bulkheads.

a. New bulkheads are prohibited, except when the bulkhead is necessary to the continued operation or expansion of a water dependent or water related use.

b. Major repair of existing bulkheads is prohibited, except when

(1) the bulkhead is necessary to the continued operation or expansion of a water dependent or water related use; or

(2) a bioengineered solution, such as using plants or other approved natural material to stabilize the shore, will not achieve the same level of shoreline stabilization and property protection.

6. Streets.

a. Existing public or private streets are excluded from these buffer regulations, provided that if the provisions of Title 22, Subtitle VIII, the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code apply, the Director shall require adequate stormwater detention to prevent harm from the street to habitat and to keep degradation of water quality for habitat to a minimum.

b. New streets are allowed when the following criteria are met:

(1) the street is allowed under Title 23, including chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

(2) no vegetation is removed, impervious surface is not increased, and no net loss of ecological function of the critical area or buffer from other actions occurs; or

(3) if the actions described in subsection (b)(2) above occur, any impacts on the ecological function are mitigated as set out in subsection 4e above.

 7. The following provisions apply to all parcels containing shoreline habitat and buffers to prevent impacts to the habitat and buffer:

a. Any increases in surface runoff from development shall be kept to a minimum, and surface water run off shall be controlled, treated and released so that receiving water quality and any shore properties and features are not adversely affected. Control measures may include, but are not limited to, dikes, catch basins or settling ponds, interceptor drains and planted buffers. Allowable means to achieve this include bioswales, catch basin filters, and other methods prescribed in Title 22, Subtitle VIII, the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code.

b. Pavement in the habitat and buffer shall be kept to a minimum and permeable surfacing, where practicable, shall be used to keep surface water accumulation and runoff into the habitat and buffer to a minimum. Recommended methods are found in Title 22, Subtitle VIII, Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code. Permeable surfaces include, but are not limited to, porous asphalt, concrete, brick, or pavers; or plastic confinement systems with grass or gravel filler.

c. Best management practices shall be employed for the safe handling of fuels and toxic or hazardous materials to prevent them from entering the water. Direct runoff of these materials is prohibited. Best management practices shall be employed for prompt and effective clean-up of any spills that do occur. A spill prevention and response plan may be required by the Director.

d. Any cleaning or resurfacing operation occurring over water that may result in the entry of debris, such as paint chips, shall employ tarpaulins securely affixed above the water line to prevent material from entering the water. Prior to removing the tarpaulins, the accumulated contents shall be removed by vacuuming or an equivalent method that prevents material from entering the water.

e. No over-water application of paint, preservative treatment, or other chemical compounds is permitted, except in accordance with best management practices.

f. Wooden components that will be in contact with standing water or floodwaters shall not contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), creosote, pentachlorophenol, or similar toxic substances. Durable, non-toxic components is the preferred material for in-water and over-water structures. Where treated wood is considered necessary, it shall be applied and used in accordance with the American Wood Preserver Association (AWPA) standards for aquatic use.

 g. For projects involving concrete, a concrete truck chute cleanout area shall be established to contain wet concrete. No concrete or clean out shall be allowed to enter the water body. This does not prohibit piers or other concrete structures authorized by a valid permit.

h. All inlets and catch basins shall be protected from fresh concrete, paving, paint stripping and other high-risk pollution generating activities during construction.

i. Construction staging areas shall be as far from the ordinary high water mark as practicable.

j. Plantingnative vegetation may be required to mitigate impacts of development on the shoreline habitat or buffer.

k. If at any time project-related activities cause a fish kill to occur, the permitee shall stop all work relating to the fish kill and immediately notify the Department of Planning and Development, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Washington Department of Ecology.

l. In- and over-water structures shall be designed and located to keep impacts from shading of any bank and shallow water habitat to a minimum.  8. Removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation in shoreline habitat or its buffer is prohibited, except as authorized under subsections 1-6 above and section 25.09.320.

C. 1. Development on parcels containing fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall comply with any species habitat management plan set out in a Director's Rule. The Director may establish by rule a species habitat management plan to protect any priority species identified by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife or to protect species of local importance.

2. Any person proposing development on a parcel containing fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall consult with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and comply with any requirements of that agency, except as limited in subsections A and B above.

D. Based on information provided by a qualified wildlife  biologist, the Director may condition development on parcels containing wildlife habitat or corridors defined in subsection 25.09.020 D3 to protect fish or wildlife habitat corridors. Conditions may include, but are not limited to:

1. Establishment of buffer zones;

2. Preservation of important vegetation and habitat features;

3. Limitation of access to habitat areas;  4. Seasonal restriction of construction activities;

 5. Preservation of the ability for fish to pass between fish habitat in Type 1-5 waters upstream and downstream of the parcel. The application requirements and general conditions of this chapter, Sections 25.09.330 and 25.09.060, do not apply if the person responsible for development of the parcel has either a Hydraulic Project Approval from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife or a Section 404 permit under the federal Clean Water Act from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Nothing in this subsection alters the rights of the owner of the pipe or culvert

, if that person is not an applicant for a permit.  6. Requiring the developer to daylight a pipe or culvert defined in SMC 25.09.020 D3c, when the conditions in subsection 6a below are met. When requiring daylighting, the Director is authorized to modify the conditions set out in subsection 6b below. Nothing in this subsection alters the rights of the owner of the pipe or culvert, if that person is not an applicant for a permit.

 a. The Director may require daylighting under the following conditions:

 (1) When the existing pipe or culvert cannot remain in its current location and provide an effective passage for anadromous fish due to the development.

 (2) Other methods for preserving fish passage such as pipe or culvert placement or site engineering are not feasible.

 b. If daylighting is required then the applicant

 must prepare a plan that demonstrates the following:

 (1) The ecological functions of the daylighted waters and resulting new riparian management area are compatible with and protect the functions of pipes and culverts upstream and downstream and the ecological functions of the existing riparian corridor upstream and downstream and do not contribute to flooding.

 (2) The ecological functions include preventing erosion, protecting water quality, and providing diverse habitat.

 c. The Director determines that daylighting the pipe or culvert and the impacts from the development to fish passage on the parcel are roughly proportionate.

 d. When requiring daylighting, the Director is authorized to modify the following conditions:

(1) Yard and/or setback requirements on the property may be reduced to provide sufficient area for daylighting and creating a riparian management area, unless reducing them is injurious to safety.  (2) The riparian corridor watercourse and riparian management area may count toward open space requirements for all multifamily or commercial zone requirements.

 (3) Required parking may be reduced up to twenty five percent (25%).

 (4) The riparian management area may be reduced to the extent needed to provide sufficient area for the plan described in subsection 6a(2) above.

E. Designating Species of Local Importance and their Habitat.

1. The Director on an annual basis shall accept and consider nominations for species of wildlife and their habitat to be designated as locally important. The designation of a species of local importance and its habitat shall require an amendment to this chapter.

2. Species or habitat to be designated shall exhibit the following characteristics:

a. Local populations of native species are in danger of extinction based on existing trends:

(1) Local populations of native species that are likely to become endangered; or

(2) Local populations of native species that are vulnerable or declining;

b. The species has recreational, commercial, game, tribal, or other special value;

c. Long-term persistence of a species is dependent on the protection, maintenance, and/or restoration of the nominated habitat;

d. Protection by other county, state, or federal policies, laws, regulations, or nonregulatory tools is not adequate to prevent degradation of the species or habitat in Seattle;

e. Areas nominated to protect a particular habitat or species have either high-quality habitat or habitat with a high potential to recover to a suitable quality, and the habitat is limited in quantity, highly vulnerable to alteration, or connects habitats.

3. Species and habitats may be nominated for designation by any person. Nominations shall be in writing, address the characteristics listed in subsection 2, and state whether specific habitat features are being nominated (for example, nest sites, breeding areas, and nurseries), or whether the habitat or ecosystem is being nominated in its entirety. Where restoration of habitat is proposed, a specific plan for restoration shall be provided with the application, or the nomination shall include management strategies for the species or habitats. Restoration plans and management strategies shall be supported by the best available science.

4. The Director shall determine whether the nomination proposal is complete, and if complete, shall evaluate it under the criteria in subsection (2) and make a recommendation to the Mayor and Council based on that information. If the nomination is adopted, the Director may establish habitat restoration plans and habitat and species management strategies by rule.

a. No development is in a riparian corridor, shoreline habitat, shoreline habitat buffer, wetland, or wetland buffer.  b. No riparian management area, shoreline habitat buffer, or wetland buffer is reduced.

 c. No development is on a steep slope area or its buffer unless the property being divided is predominantly characterized by steep slope areas, or unless approved by the Director under Section 25.09.180 B2a, b or c.

(1) The preference is to cluster units away from steep slope areas and buffers.

(2) The Director shall require clear and convincing evidence that the provisions of this subsection B are met when clustering units on steep slope areas and steep slope area buffers with these characteristics:

(a) a wetland over fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet in size or a watercourse designated part of a riparian corridor; or

(b) an undeveloped area over five (5) acres characterized by steep slopes; or

(c) areas designated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife as urban natural open space habitat areas with significant tree cover providing valuable wildlife habitat.  d. The proposal protects Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife priority species and maintains wildlife habitat.

 e. The open water area of a shoreline habitat, wetland or riparian corridor shall not be counted in determining the permitted number of lots.

 f. The proposal does not result in unmitigated negative environmental impacts, including drainage and water quality, erosion, and slope stability on the identified environmentally critical area and its buffer.

 g. The proposal promotes expansion, restoration or enhancement of the identified environmentally critical area and buffer.

2. General Environmental Impacts and Site Characteristics.

a. The proposal keeps potential negative effects of the development on the undeveloped portion of the site to a minimum and preserves topographic features.

b. The proposal retains and protects vegetation on designated nondisturbance areas, protects stands of mature trees, keeps tree removal to a minimum, removes noxious weeds and protects the visual continuity of vegetated areas and tree canopy.

3. Neighborhood Compatibility.

a. The total number of lots permitted on-site shall not be increased beyond that permitted by the underlying single-family zone.

b. Where dwelling units are proposed to be attached, they do not exceed the height, bulk and other applicable development standards of the Lowrise 1 (L-1) zone.

c. The development is reasonably compatible with and keeps the negative impact on the surrounding neighborhood to a minimum. This includes, but is not limited to, concerns such as neighborhood character, land use, design, height, bulk, scale, yards, pedestrian environment, and preservation of the tree canopy and other vegetation.

C. Conditions.

1. In authorizing an administrative conditional use, the Director may mitigate adverse negative impacts by imposing requirements and conditions necessary to protect riparian corridors, wetlands and their buffers, shoreline habitats and their buffers, and steep slope areas and their buffers, and to protect other properties in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located.

2. In addition to any conditions imposed under subsection 1, the following conditions apply to all administrative conditional uses approved under this subsection:

a. Replacement and establishment of native  vegetation shall be required where it is not possible to save trees or vegetation.

b. Where new lots are created, the provisions of Section 23.22.062, Unit lot subdivisions, or Section 23.24.045, Unit lot subdivisions, apply, regardless of whether the proposal is a unit lot subdivision, so that subsequent development on a single lot does not result in the development standards of this chapter being exceeded for the short subdivision or subdivision as a whole.

D. The Director shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions to support the Director's decision. The process and procedures for notice of decision and appeal of this administrative conditional use shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

The Director may issue a stop-work order whenever any use, activity, work or development (1) is being done without a permit, determination, or authorization required by this chapter, (2) is being done contrary to any determination, authorization, permit, or approval of DPD and the use, activity, work or development will immediately impact an environmentally critical area or materially impair the Director's ability to secure compliance with this chapter, or (3) immediately threatens the public health, safety, and welfare with respect to the interests protected under this section.

B. The stop-work order shall describe the violation in writing and be posted on the premises or served on any person responsible for the violation. Except emergency work necessary to stabilize the site that may be required by the Director, it is unlawful for any work on the property to be done after the posting or service of a stop-work order until authorization to proceed is given by the Director.

C. The stop-work order may require that vegetation, land, watercourse, premises, building, structure, or portion thereof, be vacated within a reasonable time, depending on the degree of danger, specified in the order. No person shall occupy the vegetation, land, premises, building, structure, or portion thereof after the date on which it is required to be vacated until the vegetation, land, watercourse, premises, building, structure, or portion thereof, is restored to a safe condition as determined by the Director.

 25.09.450 Review by the Director.

A. Any person significantly affected by a notice of violation or stop-work order issued by the Director pursuant to this chapter may obtain an administrative review of the notice or order by requesting such review in writing to the Director within ten (10) days of the date of the notice or order. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until five (5:00) p.m. on the next business day. A request for administrative review is an administrative remedy that must be exhausted before judicial review of the notice or order may be sought.

B. Upon receipt of the request, the Director shall notify by mail any persons served within the notice or order and any person requesting review, advising them of the request for review, of the date of the review, and of the deadline for submitting additional written information for consideration. The deadline for submitting additional written information shall be ten (10) days from the date the notice of administrative review is mailed, unless otherwise agreed to by all persons served with the notice or order. The Director and all persons served with the notice or order may also agree to review the matter within a shorter period or time that shall not be less than three (3) days from the date the notice or order was issued.

C. The Director shall conduct the administrative review and issue a decision on the request for administrative review in the form of an Order of the Director. The Director shall review all written information received by the submission deadline and any additional evidence or information available to DPD staff and placed in the case file. The Director may also request clarification of information received and a site visit. After review of the case file and of the additional written information and/or after a site visit, the Director shall issue an Order of Director that may:

1. Sustain the notice or order;

2. Withdraw the notice or order;

3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or

4. Modify the notice or order, which may include an extension of the compliance date, if any.

D. The Director shall issue the Order of the Director no later than ten (10) days from the deadline for submitting additional information. The Order of the Director is mailed by first class mail to the person or persons named on the notice of violation or order and to any person who requested the administrative review. If the original notice or order was recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections the Order of the Director shall also be recorded.

 25.09.460 Civil Penalty.

A. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter is subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per day for each violation, and in the event of a continuing violation shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty of $500 per day for each violation from the time the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the Director has issued a notice of violation with a compliance date, the violation is deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation. For removing, clearing, or taking any action detrimental to a tree over six inches in caliper an additional civil penalty of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) shall be assessed.

B. Violations causing significant damage may be assessed an additional penalty in an amount reasonably determined to be equivalent to the economic benefit that the violator derived from the violation, measured as the greater of, the resulting increase in market value of the property, the value received by the violator, or the savings of construction costs realized.

C. The penalty imposed by this section may be collected by civil action brought in the name of the City. The Director notifies the City Attorney in writing of the name of any person subject to the penalty, and the City Attorney, with the assistance of the Director, takes appropriate action to collect the penalty. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an Order following an administrative review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.  25.09.470 Alternative Criminal Penalty.

Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil penalty provision outlined in this chapter. Each day that a person continues to violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter and each occurrence of a prohibited activity constitutes a separate offense.  25.09.480 Additional Relief.

 The Director may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition that constitutes or will constitute a violation of this chapter.
