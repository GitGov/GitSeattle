 Section 2. The description of the "Civic Center Plan - Key Tower, Park 90/5, and Other Capital Projects" project #A34200-2 in the 2005- 2010 Adopted Capital Improvement Program for the Fleets and Facilities Department is amended to read as follows:

 This umbrella project consists of multiple smaller projects creating the Civic Center complex in downtown Seattle. Elements included within this project are: tenant improvements at Seattle Municipal Tower - $25.81 million, expected completion 2006; tenant improvements at Park 90/5 - $15.8 million, expected completion 2004; transaction costs related to the sale of the Alaska Building - $450,000, expected completion 2005; demolition costs for the Municipal Building and Public Safety Building - $11.9 million, expected completion 2006; acquisition of the SeaPark Garage - $19.49 million, completed 1999; open space for the Justice Center Plaza and City Hall plaza - $14.32 million, expected completion 2004; access improvements at the base of the Seattle Municipal Tower - $4.55 million, completed 2004; creation of retail and civic space on the northwest corner of the new City Hall - ~~$4.85 million~~$4.966 million, expected completion 2005; Civic Center Master Plan costs - $1.16 million, expected completion 2006; and Public Safety Building Redevelopment Planning - ~~$410,000~~$620,000.

 Section 3. The description of the "Sand Point Magnuson Park - Wetlands Development" project #K733133 in the 2005-2010 Adopted Capital Improvement Program for the Department of Parks and Recreation is amended to read as follows:

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, develops the first phase of approximately 65 acres of wetlands and upland at Warren G. Magnuson Park. The project is combined with the 2001 project Sand Point Magnuson Park - Wetlands Restoration (K73503), which funded the design for the drainage in the park, demolition of two small buildings and the subsurface of the commissary, and the removal of a portion of asphalt pavement near the athletic fields and wetland area. In 2000, the State of Washington Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development awarded a $500,000 grant to this project which reimburses the appropriation from the CRF-Unrestricted Subaccount included in Ordinance 119959. In the August 2004 Supplemental Ordinance (121556), $450,000 was transferred to this project from the former Sand Point Magnuson Park Building 30 Roof Replacement project, to reimburse funds previously borrowed from this project. Operations and maintenance costs associated with levy projects are to be funded out of levy proceeds through 2008.

 In the 2004 budget process, Council adopted a proviso that limited the total combined spending on this project and the Sand Point Magnuson Park - Wetlands Development (project K733133) to no more than $100,000 in 2004 until authorized by future ordinance. Ordinance 121502, which approved the Magnuson Park Wetland/Habitat and Athletic Field Master Plan, removed this budget proviso.

 Section 4. The description of the "North Queen Anne Drive Bridge - Seismic Improvements" project #TC366170 in the 2005-2010 Adopted Capital Improvement Program for the Seattle Department of Transportation is amended to read as follows:

 This project seismically retrofits the North Queen Anne Drive Bridge, which was built in 1935. The bridge is a heavily-used primary arterial link between the densely populated residential community and business district of Queen Anne and State Route 99 (Aurora Ave. N.). Seismic improvements strengthen the bridge in order to minimize the likelihood of heavy damage or collapse during an earthquake. The project encountered unanticipated field conditions that have led to cost escalations. When construction began, it was discovered that lead contamination was present in the soil all around the base of the bridge. Dealing with the cleanup and disposal has added to the total project cost. Funding from 2005 through 2009 includes closeout costs and a wetlands plant restoration and monitoring plan.

 Section 5. In accordance with Ordinance 121660, Subsection 4 (b), one new project is established in the Fleets and Facilities Department's 2005-2010 Adopted Capital Improvement Program as described in Exhibit II to this ordinance.

 Section 6. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, some of the foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2005 Budget.

 Section 7. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 8. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
