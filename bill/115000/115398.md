 ORDINANCE .

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Olympic Sculpture Park, granting to the Seattle Art Museum permission to construct, maintain and operate two (2) skybridges for pedestrian access over and across: 1) Elliott Avenue between Bay Street and Broad Street, and 2) Alaskan Way between Bay Street and Broad Street, for a ten (10) year term, renewable for four (4) successive ten-year terms, specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted, and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) proposes to develop the Olympic Sculpture Park on the two city blocks bounded by Bay Street, Western Avenue, Broad Street and Alaskan Way, and on the City-owned waterfront parcel to the west of Alaskan Way next to Myrtle Edwards Park; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 30760 the City Council, with the Mayor concurring approved the design of the Olympic Sculpture Park; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 30771 the City Council, with the Mayor concurring granted conceptual approval of two pedestrian skybridges, one crossing over Elliott Avenue between Bay and Broad Streets and the other crossing over Alaskan Way between Bay and Broad Streets, as proposed by the Seattle Art Museum as part of its development of the Olympic Sculpture Park; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Chapter 15.64, SAM has submitted the information required for the Director of Transportation to make a recommendation to the Council on whether to grant or deny conceptual approval, and the Director has circulated the information to the Seattle Design Commission, and to the City departments and public and private utilities interested in or affected by the proposed skybridges, and compiled the responses (C.F. 307255); and

 WHEREAS, the departments and utilities have no objections to the conceptual design of the skybridges, and the Design Commission supports the two proposed skybridges as a core element of the Olympic Sculpture Park design and recommends that the Council approve the final application; and

 WHEREAS, in making her recommendation, the Director of Transportation considered the 12 elements set forth at SMC 15.64.050.B, and recommended that conceptual approval be granted; and

 WHEREAS, the adoption of this ordinance is the culmination of the approval process for the skybridges and will allow the Seattle Art Museum to move forward with construction of the bridges; NOW THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the Seattle Art Museum ("SAM") , its successors and assigns ("Permittee"), to construct, maintain and operate in conjunction with the Olympic Sculpture Park ("OSP") a skybridge over and across Elliott Avenue between Bay Street and Broad Street ("Elliott Avenue Bridge"), and a skybridge over and across a portion of Alaskan Way between Bay Street and Broad Street, including the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway franchise area ("Alaskan Way Bridge"). The Elliott Avenue Bridge will support the Park's central pathway, seating areas, sculpture and landscaping on a vee-shaped structure with an average width of 72 feet, located approximately 20 feet above street grade, and will connect Broad Street and the eastern-most OSP parcel, lying between Western Avenue and Elliott Avenue, with the parcel lying between Elliott Avenue and Alaskan Way, as shown on Attachment A hereto. The Alaskan Way Bridge will also support the central pathway, seating areas, sculpture and landscaping on a structure with an average width of 75 feet, located approximately 24 feet above the surface of the right-of-way, and will connect the eastern OSP parcels with the park boulevard and provide access to SAM's waterfront parcel and Myrtle Edwards Park's southern entrance, as shown on Attachment A hereto. The Alaskan Way Bridge includes the ramp, stairs and abutment where it connects with that portion of Alaskan Way designated as a park boulevard by Ordinance 121721 (" the Boulevard"). Permittee's use of the Boulevard as part of the OSP is governed by a separate Operation and Maintenance Agreement between the City and Permittee.

 Section 2. The permission hereby granted ("Permit") is for a term of ten (10) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term, the Director of Transportation ("Director") may renew the permit for four (4) successive ten (10) year terms; additionally, SDOT will notify the Permittee in writing that the total term of the Permit as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed fifty (50) years, subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City") by ordinance to revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein. The Director will provide written notice to Permittee, at least sixty (60) days prior to expiration of each term that the Permit is scheduled for renewal.

 Section 3. Elliott Avenue Bridge The permission hereby granted to use a portion of Elliott Avenue for a skybridge is subordinate to the public's use of Elliott Avenue for transportation purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the skybridge or any portion thereof at the Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the skybridge is necessary for any non-pedestrian public travel or transportation use, or that the skybridge interferes with any public transportation use; or a City Council determination that the space is necessary for a public transportation use shall be conclusive and final.

 (b) The Director of Transportation ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and the Permittee does not correct such violation within thirty (30) days of written notification from the City, or within such longer period of time that the Director determines is necessary for Permittee to correct the violation.

 In the event that the Permit is not renewed or the Permit hereby granted extends to its termination in fifty (50) years, or the City orders removal of the skybridge pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove," as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the skybridge and shall place all portions of Elliott Avenue that may have been disturbed for any part of the skybridge in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Upon removal and restoration, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 4. Alaskan Way Bridge. The Alaskan Way Bridge shall be open for pedestrian use by the public from dawn to dusk from its western abutment on the Boulevard to the western boundary of the Permittee's parcel of property located between Alaskan Way and Western Avenue. The Permittee shall grant to the City an easement for public pedestrian travel purposes over that portion of said parcel to be occupied by the Alaskan Way Bridge, said easement to continue on, along and over a path seven (7) feet in width across said parcel in a southerly direction from the eastern terminus of said Bridge to Broad Street, as shown on Attachment A hereto. The easement shall be for a term corresponding to the term of this Permit (fifty years, based on all renewals, terminating at the same time in 2055 as the permission herein granted); provided, however, that if a second term permit is granted at that time, the easement shall not terminate and shall continue in effect until the end of such second term permit. The easement shall contain a provision stating that it is open to public use from at least dawn until dusk.

 Because the Alaskan Way Bridge will constitute a transportation use and benefit to the public by providing a pedestrian walkway above the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway connecting the Boulevard to the Olympic Sculpture Park and adjacent public streets, upon termination of the permission granted by this ordinance, the City may elect to assume ownership and operation of the Alaskan Way Bridge as a City facility, or to order its removal as set forth in Section 3 for the Elliott Avenue Bridge upon termination of the permission granted by this ordinance. Upon the City's election to assume ownership and operation, the Permittee shall convey the Alaskan Way Bridge structure to the City without representation or warranty. In the event that the City determines that the Alaskan Way Bridge must be removed upon termination of permission to maintain and operate it, the Permittee shall remove all sculpture and other art installations from the Boulevard and the Alaskan Way Bridge. At the City's election, all other additions, fixtures and improvements made to or constructed upon Alaskan Way Bridge shall remain upon the Alaskan Way Bridge without compensation to the Permittee.

 Section 5. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair, other than routine repair and maintenance, of the skybridges except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director. After notice to and consultation with Permittee, the Director in his/her judgment may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the skybridges at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the skybridges.

 Section 6. After notice to the Permittee, and failure of the Permittee to correct said unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order the skybridges closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 7. Not withstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or removal of the skybridges, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 (a) The bridges and all related equipment and property are removed from the street or park boulevard, or in the case of the Alaskan Way Bridge, the City has assumed its ownership and operation;

 (b) The area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and

 (c) The Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove the skybridges and its property and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 8. Except as otherwise provided herein, the skybridges shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of this ordinance and the Permit hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to Permittee's own property, and covenants and agrees with the City, to at all times indemnify, defend and save harmless the City from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, or licensees, by reason of the Permittee's maintenance, operation or use of said skybridges, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee's failure or refusal to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance (collectively "Indemnified Actions"); and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City for an Indemnified Action, the Permittee shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the Indemnified Action at its sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action for an Indemnified Action, the Permittee shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance or that other concurrent negligence has occurred, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 (a) The City, its agents, contractors or employees; or

 (b) The Permittee, its agents, contractors, or employees.

 Then each party shall indemnify the other to extent of that party's negligence.

 Section 9. The parties acknowledge the existing Environmental Agreement between the City and SAM dated December 7, 1999 ("Environmental Agreement"), deals with the parties' respective obligations relating to contamination and environmental conditions in the City rights-of-way. No change of rights, obligations, or responsibilities under the existing Environmental Agreement shall occur as a result of this Ordinance or Permit, except as expressly provided in this section. Permittee shall be responsible for any and all costs that arise from or are related to soil removal, if required, and recapping of soil, if required, to the extent required to complete Permittee's construction of the skybridges. Such costs include, but are not limited to, disposal of contaminated soil or groundwater that is removed during construction, replacement of material that is capping contaminated soil and is disturbed during construction, mitigation measures required by permitting authorities, and worker safety measures required for construction on a contaminated site.

 Section 10. For as long as the Permittee shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until the skybridges are entirely removed from their location as described in Section 3 or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 7 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which protect the City from any and all loss, damages, suits, liability, claims, demands or costs resulting from injury or harm to persons or property.

 Minimum insurance requirements shall be an occurrence form policy of commercial general liability, placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State. Minimum policy limits shall be $2,000,000 per occurrence, $4,000,000 annual aggregate. Coverage shall specifically name the skybridge exposure. Coverage shall add by endorsement The City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insured's Clause indicating essentially that "except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part to the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought." Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a copy of the full insurance policy with all endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of The City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager

 Section 11. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work on the premises as contemplated by this permit, name The City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all pertinent contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to SAM to the City as well.

 Section 12. Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance the Permittee shall deliver to the Director for filing with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond in the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) for each bridge executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington conditioned that the Permittee will comply with each and every provision of this ordinance and with each and every order of the Director pursuant thereto; provided, that if the Mayor of the City of Seattle in his/her judgment shall deem any bond or bonds filed to be insufficient and demand a new or additional bond, the Permittee shall furnish a new or additional bond in such amount as the Director may specify to be necessary to fully protect the City. Said bond shall remain in effect until such time as the skybridges are entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1, or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 7 of this ordinance.

 Section 13. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumber any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance. The Permit conferred by this ordinance shall not be assignable or transferable by operation of law.

 Section 14. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to The City of Seattle such amounts as may be justly chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of the subject skybridges during construction, reconstruction, or repair, and at other times deemed necessary to ensure the safety of the skybridges, under the direction of the Director, and in addition shall promptly pay to the City in advance upon statements rendered by the Director an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of $7,451.66 for each of the first five years of the permit. The fee will then be evaluated by the City and a new fee may be established by resolution of the City Council for each succeeding five years of the permit. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the Seattle Department of Transportation subfund for Street Use.

 Section 15. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions and the easement required in Section 4 above to the Director within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The Director shall record the easement with the King County Recorder's Office and file the recorded easement and the Permittee's acceptance with the City Clerk. If the easement and acceptance are not timely received, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 16. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
