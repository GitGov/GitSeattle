 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Ethics Code (SMC Chapter 4.16): amending SMC Section 4.16.030; SMC Section 4.16.070, and SMC Section 4.17.100; and adding a new SMC Section 4.16.085 regarding advisory opinions.

 WHEREAS, advisory boards and commissions do not have the authority to enact, administer, interpret, or execute City laws, but rather simply to provide advice or recommendations to City entities that do have such authority; and

 WHEREAS, the City seeks to encourage qualified people to serve as volunteers on advisory boards and commissions while also conducting their ordinary course of business and related affairs; and

 WHEREAS, all persons subject to the provisions of the Ethics Code, including members of advisory boards and commissions, are required to operate in an ethical manner that maintains the public trust in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts; and

 WHEREAS, the prohibitions in SMC 4.16.070.1(a) and SMC 4.16.070.1(b) may unnecessarily deter qualified individuals from volunteering on advisory boards and commissions; and,

 WHEREAS, requiring members of advisory boards or commissions to disqualify themselves if they have a direct or indirect financial conflict of interest in a matter before the board or commission is necessary to protect impartiality and public confidence in advisory boards and commissions; and

 WHEREAS, requiring members of advisory boards and commissions to fully disclose in public any and all circumstances giving rise to a possible appearance of conflict prior to engaging in the performance of official duties meets the twin goals of transparency in government and recruitment of qualified individuals to serve on advisory boards and commissions; and

 WHREREAS, the Ethics and Elections Commission is empowered to take actions, including: 1) recommending prosecution, 2) requiring reimbursement for damages and costs related to the investigation, 3) recommending the cancellation and rescission of the action in question, and 4) recommending censure or removal of members of advisory boards and commissions who violate the Ethics Code; and

 WHEREAS, imposing monetary fines on members of advisory boards and commissions, in addition to the above-mentioned penalties, may deter recruitment of volunteers and be unduly burdensome; and

 WHEREAS, advisory boards and commissions do not engage in the type of proceedings to which SMC 4.16.075.B.1 applies; and

 WHEREAS, all persons subject to the provisions of the Ethics Code, including members of advisory boards and commissions, are encouraged to seek advisory opinions from the Ethics and Elections Commission or its Director prior to engaging in conduct that might violate the Ethics Code;

Engage or have engaged in any transaction or activity that would to a reasonable person appear to be in conflict with or incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties, or that would to a reasonable person appear to impair the member's independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties, without fully disclosing on the public record of the advisory committee the circumstances of the transaction or activity giving rise to such an appearance prior to engaging in the performance of such official duties.

The member shall also file with the Commission a full written disclosure of the circumstances giving rise to such an appearance prior to engaging in such official duties. If such prior written filing is impractical, the member shall file such a disclosure as soon as practical.

 Each act that violates one or more provisions of Chapter 4.16 may constitute a separate violation. Violation may be proven by a preponderance of evidence, and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

 Section 4. SMC Chapter 4.16 is amended by adding a new Section 4.16.085 to read as follows:

 SMC 4.16.085 Advisory Opinions - Effect on Enforcement.

 The Commission shall not find that a person's conduct violates this chapter if: 1) the person has submitted to the Executive Director or to the Commission a written request for an advisory opinion;

 2) the request describes possible future conduct and accurately and fully discloses the material facts related to that conduct; 3) the Executive Director or the Commission issues a written advisory opinion that the described conduct would not violate this chapter; and 4) the person, in reasonable reliance on the advisory opinion, acts in a manner consistent with that advisory opinion.

An advisory opinion issued by the Executive Director shall have no binding effect in any other proceeding.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
