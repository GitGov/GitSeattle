This Amendment is made and entered into as of ____________________by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City"), acting through its DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION (the "Parks Department"), and the WOODLAND PARK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY, a Washington non-profit corporation ("WPZS") (collectively, the "Parties").

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle Ordinance 120697 approved an Operations and Management Agreement between the City and WPZS wherein WPZS assumed operational and managerial responsibility for the Woodland Park Zoo (the "Zoo") over a renewable twenty-year period, effective March 1, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, two separate studies, the 1988 Gardener study and the 1998 Transpo Study, found that the existing parking lots at the Zoo were inadequate to handle the current and projected Zoo attendance; and

 WHEREAS, the scoping process for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Woodland Park Zoo proposed Long-Range Physical Development Plan (the "Long- Range Plan"), identified the impact of Zoo visitor parking on the surrounding neighborhoods as a principal concern for study in the EIS; and

 WHEREAS, as required under the Agreement, the City and WPZS studied traffic and parking issues associated with the proposed Long-Range Plan. The studies were undertaken in the context of preparing a new EIS on the proposed Long-Range Plan and satisfied the requirements of the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, a new EIS (prepared during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003, published in draft in July 2003 and in final on December 31, 2003) on the proposed Long-Range Plan examined seven alternate scenarios for provision of structured parking at the Zoo to satisfy the needs of the Zoo for parking and help address impacts of the Zoo on its surrounding neighborhoods; and

 WHEREAS, the City and WPZS have now identified the structured parking alternative that best balances the need for increased parking capacity with cost considerations; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks Department and WPZS have included a parking garage in the proposed Long-Range Plan; hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 1. Definition.

 1.1 Subsection 1.13, "EIS," is hereby amended as follows:

 "EIS" shall mean the ~~draft~~final revised environmental impact statement prepared for the Zoo's draft Long-Range Plan ~~2001~~2002.

 1.2 Subsection 1.17, "Long Range Plan" is hereby amended as follows:

 "Long-Range Plan" shall mean the Zoo's draft Long-Range Plan ~~2001~~2002, and any adoption or amendments thereto, prepared as a 20-year development plan and update of the 1976 Long-Range Plan.

 1.3 Subsection 1.27, "Parking Garage," is replaced with the following:

 "Parking Garage" shall mean the parking structure, structures or surface improvements as described in Section 2 of this Amendment.

 2. Parking Garage. With respect to the Parking Garage, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

 2.1 Insert a new Subsection 8.9 as follows:

 Zoo On Site Parking. Following completion of the revised EIS and after considering the alternatives examined, the Parties concur that not less than 1,360 visitor parking spaces shall be provided at the Zoo through a combination of a parking structure or structures and surface improvements. Such total spaces shall be available as soon as practicable but no later than December 31, 2010. Such total spaces shall be provided as follows: (a) construction by WPZS of a multi-story parking structure located north of the current West Entrance to the Zoo on Phinney Avenue providing approximately 700 stalls, the final number of such stalls to be determined by WPZS with the consent of the Parks Department and; (b) surface improvements yielding the balance of the requisite minimum number of spaces including existing surface parking (net of any spaces lost to construction of the parking structure) and additional spaces to be provided at locations to be determined by WPZS with the consent of the Parks Department. It is the intention of the Parties that there be no diminution of overall Zoo green space, from that reflected in the Long-Range Plan due to changes in parking.

 2.2 City Finance Responsibility. Subsection 8.2 is replaced with the following:

 Parking Structure Construction and Financing. Construction of the parking structure by WPZS provided for herein shall commence as soon as practicable following City approval of the proposed revised Long-Range Plan. The rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to the costs of development, design, construction, garage operations and maintenance, major maintenance, transportation demand and on-street parking management plan, taxes, financing, including interest, shall be defined and mutually agreed upon by May 1, 2005. If such agreement cannot be reached by May 1, 2005, WPZS may terminate this Agreement, provided that notice of such termination by WPZS to the City occurs prior to August 1, 2005.

 At the request of WPZS but not earlier than March 1, 2007, the City shall provide to WPZS reimbursement for WPZS's documented payments to that date for expenses for development, design, construction, and financing of that parking structure, not to exceed $16.2 million adjusted for inflation as set forth below. Thereafter, the City will reimburse WPZS monthly for the additional expenses it has incurred for the development, design, construction, and financing of such parking structure, but the total of payments by the City under this paragraph shall not exceed $16.2 million adjusted for inflation as set forth below. The project scope and budget (including capitalization of development, design and construction financing interest) shall be determined by WPZS with the consent of the Parks Department.

 Adjustment for inflation. The $16.2 million payment shall be adjusted for inflation using the ENR 20-City Construction Cost Index. The initial inflation adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the $16.2 million payment by a fraction the denominator which is the ENR 20-City Construction Cost Index (the "Cost Index") for August, 2004 and the numerator which shall be the Cost Index for the month when the initial payment is made to WPZS. An additional inflation adjustment shall be made at the time any subsequent payment is made by multiplying the payment remaining after the previous payment by a fraction the denominator which is the Cost Index for the month when the previous payment was made and the numerator which is the Cost Index for the month when the subsequent payment is made. This adjustment for inflation is illustrated in the following table.

WPZS agrees to set parking rates to encourage short-term parking and carpooling and to ensure that parking revenues provide the maximum feasible share of debt service on the Parking Garage. The City reserves the right to change any terms of this section 8.5 if and only to the extent that such changes are required, in the opinion of legal counsel to the City, to provide or maintain the tax-exempt status of bonds issued for the Parking Garage. WPZS agrees to analyze and provide a recommendation with regard to a two-tiered parking rate structure that recognizes Seattle taxpayers' contribution to the construction of the Parking Garage. This analysis and recommendation will be provided to the City by May 1, 2005.

 2.4. Subsection 8.6 "Restricted Parking Zone" is replaced with the following:

 Parking Management Strategies. Parking Management Strategies. As a part of the planning process for the garage, the City and the WPZS will jointly develop a Plan for parking management strategies.

The Plan will identify interim (pre-garage opening) and long-term (after the garage opens) strategies and funding responsibility for such strategies that are acceptable to both the Zoo Society and the City. The interim strategies may include a limited RPZ (during the off peak months) or other means of reducing the parking and traffic impact in the neighborhood prior to the opening of the garage. The City and WPZS will use their best efforts to complete a draft Plan by September 1, 2005, to ensure that any financial obligations on the part of the City for implementation of the Plan can be considered as part of the budget cycle for 2006. As a part of this agreement and to ensure the continued viability of the Zoo, the City agrees not to implement a year-round RPZ or other year-round preferential parking for residents in the area within four blocks of the Zoo without the consent of the WPZS, until the earlier of December 31, 2010 or the date the parking structure provided for herein opens, except as set forth in the next paragraph.

 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the City may implement a seasonal RPZ or other preferential parking for residents that includes any area within four blocks of the Zoo after notice to and consultation with the WPZS and residents in the affected area if either:

 (b) any one or more of the following is absent from the completed alternative transportation plan under Section 8.7:

 (i) implementation guidelines for identifying the number and types of events the Zoo intends to host during any particular year,

 (ii) a complaint procedure for neighbors to address transportation and parking issues with the WPZS, or

 (iii) formal involvement of residents from within four blocks of the Zoo in advising the WPZS on implementing the alternative transportation plan.

 If a permanent RPZ is established, WPZS shall pay for one permit fee per household for those households located within four blocks of the Zoo boundaries for an initial two- year period commencing upon completion of the garage or establishment of a permanent RPZ, whichever is later.

 2.5 Alternative Transportation. Subsection 8.7 is amended as follows:

 Alternative Transportation. To help relieve overflow parking in the neighborhoodand provide access to the zoo through means other than driving , WPZS will continue to develop an alternative transportation plan in conjunction with King County Metro and the City's Department of Transportation.Such plan, to be completed by March 1st, 2007, will define the roles, responsibilities and each of the Parties' financial commitment regarding the development and implementation of on-street parking management and transportation demand management strategies. The plan will also provide incentives for improved transit, bicycle and pedestrian access, as well as bicycle corrals and transit options for major events. ~~Improved transit~~Transit, bicycle and pedestrian access will be built into all parking improvements. WPZS will also develop an employee trip reduction plan, dedicated employee carpool spaces, and explore extending transit pass subsidies to all Zoo staff, adding a ~~f~~Flexcar and participation in the guaranteed ride home program.

 2.6 . Long-Range Plan. Section 9 is amended as follows:

 The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement contemplates the adoption by the City of the Long-Range Plan, as deemed acceptable by WPZS, on or before ~~April 1, 2002~~December 31, 2004. In the event that such a Plan is not adopted by ~~April 1, 2002~~December 31, 2004, WPZS may terminate this Agreement, provided that notice of such termination must occur prior to March 31, 2005.

The Events Center shall not be opened before the Parking Garage is in operation or January 2009, which ever is earlier.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all appurtenances, fixtures, improvements (including, specifically, the Parking Garage referenced in Section 8 of this Agreement), equipment, additions and other property attached to or installed in the Premises during the Term shall be and remain the property of City and shall not be removed by WPZS without approval of the Superintendent.

 3. Miscellaneous.

 3.1 Counterparts. This Amendment 1 may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
