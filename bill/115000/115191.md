 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to solid waste hauling; facilitating the potential removal of dumpsters from public streets and alleys by authorizing appropriate janitorial services; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.36.030.

 WHEREAS, The City Council finds that commercial establishments in the city's business districts often place large volume solid waste containers such as dumpsters in public alleys; and

 WHEREAS, Such dumpsters frequently are overfilled or unsecured resulting in waste escaping as litter or attracting vermin; and

 WHEREAS, Dumpsters also can facilitate illegal behavior by among other things concealing drug trafficking activity, public urination and defecation, and attracting graffiti which collectively contribute to an appearance of blight; and

 WHEREAS, For 25 years various City plans, including most recently the 1998 Pioneer Square Neighborhood Plan adopted by the City Council, have called for removing dumpsters from public alleys to better protect public health, safety and welfare; and

 WHEREAS, Experience with dumpster removal pilot projects over the past several years demonstrates that the aforementioned dumpster-related problems have been reduced and public health, safety and welfare improved by removing dumpsters from alleys; and

 WHEREAS, Recognizing the benefits of dumpster removal, the City has provided in its contract with its commercial waste contractor for the possibility of new and different types of service, including multiple businesses sharing a larger container in order to reduce the number of dumpsters; and

 WHEREAS, While encouraging the removal of dumpsters from alleys, the City Council intends to retain the City's control over the flow of commercial waste and direct it to the City's commercial waste contractor for collection and disposal; and

 WHEREAS, Consistent with that intent, the City Council finds that under prescribed circumstances allowing janitorial, cleaning and maintenance services to include hauling commercial waste over city streets for deposit in shared containers serviced by the City's solid waste contractor will facilitate the removal of dumpsters from public alleys; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
