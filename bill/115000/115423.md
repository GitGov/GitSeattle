 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to relocation assistance, amending and repealing various sections of, and adding new sections to, Chapter 20.84 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to provide for a uniform and equitable relocation assistance policy for Persons displaced as a direct result of City funded Projects and Programs.

 WHEREAS, both federal law (42 U.S.C. section 4601 et seq.) and state law (RCW Chapter 8.26), require local governments to provide relocation assistance to Persons and businesses displaced by programs or projects financed in whole or part with Federal Financial Assistance; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 23390, adopted in 1972, the City Council adopted a policy to provide relocation assistance in connection with all City Programs and Projects, including those not receiving Federal Financial Assistance; and

 WHEREAS, when the City Council adopted Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Chapter 20.84 (Ordinance 104542) in 1975 to implement the provisions of RCW Chapter 8.26 with respect to relocation assistance, the policies expressed in Resolution 23390 to provide relocation assistance to all Persons displaced as a result of City public works Programs and Projects and acquisitions for City Programs and Projects were not incorporated into SMC Chapter 20.84; and

 WHEREAS, in 1988 RCW Chapter 8.26 was amended to require local governments to provide relocation assistance to Persons and businesses displaced by programs or projects financed in whole or part with State Financial Assistance, but allowed a local agency to elect not to provide relocation assistance for projects not receiving federal funding; and

 WHEREAS, since state law was amended in 1988 (Chapter 90, Laws of Washington 1988, RCW 8.26.010(2 to provide this option and allow local jurisdictions to elect whether to provide relocation assistance for projects or program that do not receive Federal Financial Assistance, the City has taken no action to make any such election; and

 WHEREAS, except for amending the definition of "Department Head," SMC Chapter 20.84 has not been amended since 1975, despite changes in federal and state laws affecting the Chapter; and

 WHEREAS, one of the stated purposes of RCW Chapter 8.26 is "to establish a uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of Persons displaced as a direct result of public works program of the state and local governments in order that such Persons do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole and to minimize the hardship of displacement on such Persons," (RCW 8.26.010(2); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends to amend SMC Chapter 20.84 to accommodate changes in the law since 1975 and to adopt the theme of the policies of Resolution 23390 that a uniform and equitable relocation assistance policy apply to Persons displaced as a direct result of City funded Projects and Programs; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC ") section 20.84.010, which was enacted by Ordinance 104542, is amended to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.010 ~~Implementation of relocation assistance laws~~Purpose.

 The purposes of this chapter ~~is to implement the provisions of RCW Chapter 8.26, state regulations implementing said chapter including WAC Chapter 365-24 and any federal law, rules, regulations or orders pertaining to relocation assistance which may be applicable to any program or project for the acquisition of real property, or any interest therein, which may create a "displaced person" as that term is defined by federal or state law, rules, regulations or orders applicable to such program or project~~ are: (a) to adopt the applicable state and federal laws and regulations for relocation assistance for those City Projects and Programs undertaken with State and Federal Financial Assistance; (b) to establish a uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of Persons displaced as a direct result of Programs or Projects undertaken with City Financial Assistance but no Federal or State Financial Assistance in order that such Persons do not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of Programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole; (c) to minimize the hardship of displacement on such Persons; and (d) to provide for the payment of relocation assistance similar to that required by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Chapter 8.26 and by 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) Chapter 4601 et. seq. to those Persons displaced as a direct result of Programs or Projects undertaken with City Financial Assistance but no State or Federal Financial Assistance.

 Section 2. SMC Section 20.84.020, which was enacted by Ordinance 104542, is amended to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.020 Applicability.

 Whenever ~~the City or any department thereof undertakes the acquisition of real property in connection with~~~~a program or project~~a Program or Project is undertaken with City Financial Assistance but no Federal or State Financial Assistance and that ~~may create a "displaced person"~~ Program or Project causes there to be a "Displaced Person" as that term is defined ~~by federal or state law, rules, regulations of orders applicable to such program or project after the effective date of the ordinance codified~~ in this chapter, the provisions of this chapter ~~shall~~ apply.

Whenever a City program or project is undertaken with State Financial Assistance but no Federal Financial Assistance, the provisions of RCW Chapter 8.26 et seq. and the regulations adopted for that chapter control. If the Project or Program receives only City Financial Assistance and no State or Federal Financial Assistance, the provisions of this chapter control. The provisions of the state and federal statutes and regulations may be looked to for guidance in interpreting this chapter.

 Section 3. SMC Section 20.84.030, which was last amended by Ordinance 120794, is amended to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.030 Definitions.

~~For the purpose of this chapter and for the purpose of administering and implementing any federal, state or local relocation assistance statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order or program, applicable to any acquisition of real property or any interest therein by the City or to any program or project involving the City or any of its departments~~Except as otherwise provided in state and federal statutes and regulations applicable to projects or programs undertaken with State or Federal Financial Assistance, the following definitions apply for the purposes of this chapter:

G.Comparable Replacement Dwelling means a Dwelling that is:

1.Decent, safe and sanitary as defined in subsection I of this section;  2.

Functionally equivalent to the displacement Dwelling. A functionally equivalent Dwelling performs the same function and provides the same utility. While a Comparable Replacement Dwelling need not possess every feature of the displacement Dwelling, the principal features must be present. Generally, functional equivalency is an objective standard, reflecting the range of purposes for which the various physical features of a Dwelling may be used. In determining whether a replacement Dwelling is functionally equivalent to the displacement Dwelling, a Department may consider reasonable trade-offs for specific features when the replacement unit is equal to or better than the displacement Dwelling. (For examples, see appendix A, 49 CFR section 24.2(a)(6;

3.In an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions;

4.In a location generally not less desirable than the location of the displacement Dwelling with respect to public utilities and commercial and public facilities, and reasonably accessible to the Displaced Person's place of employment;

5.On a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements, including customary landscaping. The site need not include special improvements such as outbuildings, swimming pools, or greenhouses;

6.Currently available to the Displaced Person on the private market, except that a Comparable Replacement Dwelling for a Person receiving government housing assistance before displacement may reflect similar government housing assistance, and any requirements of the government housing assistance program relating to the size of the replacement Dwelling apply; and

7.Within the financial means of the Displaced Person.

a.A replacement Dwelling purchased by a homeowner in occupancy at the displacement Dwelling for at least 180 days prior to Initiation of Negotiations (a 180-day homeowner) is considered to be within the homeowner's financial means if the homeowner will receive the full price differential, all increased Mortgage interest costs, and all incidental expenses described in Section 20.84.400, plus any additional amount required to be paid for Replacement Housing of Last Resort under Section 20.84.430.

b.For a Tenant or Owner-occupant who actually and lawfully occupied the displacement Dwelling for at least 90 days prior to the Initiation of Negotiations (a 90-day occupant), a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is considered to be within the Displaced Person's financial means if, after receiving rental assistance pursuant to Section 20.84.410, the Displaced Person's portion of the monthly rent plus average monthly Utility Costs for the replacement Dwelling do not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Displaced Person's gross monthly Household Income from all sources.

c.For a Displaced Person who is not eligible to receive a replacement housing payment due to failure to meet the length of occupancy requirements contained in Sections 20.84.400 or 20.84.410, comparable replacement housing is considered to be within the Displaced Person's financial means if, for a period of 42 months, the Department pays that portion of the monthly housing costs for a replacement Dwelling that exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Displaced Person's gross monthly Household Income from all sources. Such payments must be paid under the provisions for Replacement Housing of Last Resort pursuant to Section 20.84.430.

H.Contribute Materially means that during the two taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or during such other period as the Department determines to be more equitable, a Business or Farm Operation:

3.Contributed at least 33 1/3 % of the Owner's or operator's average annual gross income from all sources.

4.If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or hardship in any given case, the Department may approve the use of other criteria it determines appropriate.

I.Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling means a Dwelling that meets the applicable standards in the Housing and Building Maintenance Code, Chapter 22.206, is adequate in size to accommodate the occupants, and, for a Displaced Person with a disability, is free of any barriers that would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the Dwelling by such Displaced Person.

J.Department means The City of Seattle or any of its subdivisions or instrumentalities, including without limitation, any City office, board, or commission, the City Council and any of its committees, and any public corporation defined in Chapter 3.110, that acquires real property, implements a Project, or conducts a Program (including any Program that provides funding for a Project), that directly causes a Person to become a Displaced Person as defined in this chapter. For purposes of a Project or Program that is not undertaken by a Department, the use of the term "Department" throughout this chapter means "Agency."  K.

Fee title, a life estate, a land contract, a 99-year lease, or a lease including any options for extension with at least 50 years to run from the date of Acquisition;  2.

Proof of delivery or mailing shall be documented and kept in the relocation files.

 Section 8. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.085, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.085 Relocation Notices.

 A. General information notice. As soon as feasible, a Person scheduled to be displaced shall be furnished with a general written description of the relocation program, which description does at least the following:

 1. Informs the Person that the Person may be displaced for the Program or Project and generally describes the relocation payment(s) for which the Person may be eligible, the basic conditions of eligibility, and the procedures for obtaining the payment(s).

 2. Informs the Person that the Person will be given reasonable relocation advisory services, including referrals to replacement properties, help in filing payment claims, and other necessary assistance to help the Person successfully relocate.

 3. Informs the Person that the Person will not be required to move without at least 90 days' advance written notice, and informs any Person to be displaced from a Dwelling that the Person cannot be required to move permanently unless at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling has been made available.

 4. Describes the Person's right to appeal the Department's determination of a Person's eligibility for, or the amount of, any assistance under this chapter.

 B. Relocation eligibility and Notice thereof. Eligibility for relocation assistance begins on the date of a Notice of Intent to Acquire, the Initiation of Negotiations for the occupied property, or the date of actual Acquisition, whichever occurs first. When eligibility begins, the Department shall promptly notify all occupants in writing of their eligibility for applicable relocation assistance.

 C. Ninety-day notice.

 1. General. No lawful occupant shall be required to move unless the occupant has received at least 90 days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the occupant may be required to move.

 3. Content of notice. The 90-day notice shall either state a specific date as the earliest date by which the occupant may be required to move, or state that the occupant will receive a further notice indicating, at least 30 days in advance, the specific date by which he or she must move. If the 90-day notice is issued before a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available, the notice must state clearly that the occupant will not have to move earlier than 90 days after such a Dwelling is made available.

 4. Urgent need. In unusual circumstances, an occupant may be required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written notice if the Department determines that a 90-day notice is impracticable, such as when the Person's continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial danger to health or safety. A copy of the Department's determination shall be included in the applicable case file.

 Section 9. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.095, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.095 Availability of Comparable Replacement Dwelling Before Displacement.

 A. General. No Person to be displaced shall be required to move from his or her Dwelling unless at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling has been made available to the Person. Where possible, three or more Comparable Replacement Dwellings shall be made available. A Comparable Replacement Dwelling will be considered to have been made available to a Person, if:

 1. The Person is informed of its location;

 2. The Person has sufficient time, based on then existing industry practice, to negotiate and enter into a purchase agreement or lease for the property; and

 3. Subject to reasonable safeguards, the Person is assured of receiving the relocation assistance and acquisition payment to which the Person is entitled in sufficient time to complete the purchase or lease of the property.

 B. Circumstances permitting waiver. The Department may grant a waiver of the requirement in subsection A where it is demonstrated that a Person must move because of:

 1. A major disaster defined in 42 U.S.C. section 5122;

 2. A presidentially declared national emergency; or

 3. Another emergency that requires immediate vacation of the real property, such as when continued occupancy of the displacement Dwelling constitutes a substantial danger to the health or safety of the occupants or the public.

 C. Basic conditions of emergency move. Whenever a Person to be displaced is required to relocate from the displacement Dwelling for a temporary period because of an emergency described in subsection B of this section, the Department shall:

 1. Take whatever steps are necessary to assure that the Person is temporarily relocated to a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling;

 2. Pay the actual reasonable out-of-pocket moving expenses and any reasonable increase in rent and Utility Costs incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; and

 3. Make available to the Displaced Person as soon as feasible, at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling. (For purposes of filing a claim and meeting the eligibility requirements for a relocation payment, the date of displacement is the date the Person moves from the temporarily-occupied Dwelling.)

 Section 10. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.105, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.105 Relocation Planning, Advisory Services, and Coordination.

 A. Relocation planning. During the early stages of development, Programs or Projects shall be planned in such a manner that the problems associated with the displacement of individuals, families, Businesses, farms, and Nonprofit Organizations are recognized and solutions are developed to minimize the adverse impacts of displacement. Such planning, where appropriate as determined by the Department, shall precede any action by a Department that will cause displacement, and should be scaled to the complexity and nature of the anticipated displacing activity, including an evaluation of Program resources available to carry out timely and orderly relocations. Planning may involve a relocation survey or study that may include the following:

 1. An estimate of the number of households to be displaced including information such as Owner /Tenant status, estimated value and rental rates of properties to be acquired, family characteristics, and special consideration of the impacts on minorities, the elderly, large families, and Persons with disabilities when applicable.

 2. An estimate of the number of Comparable Replacement Dwellings in the area (including price ranges and rental rates) that are expected to be available to fulfill the needs of those households displaced. When an adequate supply of Comparable Replacement Dwellings is not expected to be available, the Department should consider housing of last resort actions.

 3. An estimate of the number, type, and size of the Businesses, farms, and Nonprofit Organizations to be displaced and the approximate number of employees that may be affected.

 4. An estimate of the availability of replacement business sites. When an adequate supply of replacement business sites is not expected to be available, the impacts of displacing the Businesses should be considered and addressed. Planning for displaced Businesses that are reasonably expected to involve complex or lengthy moving processes or Small Businesses with limited financial resources and/or few alternative relocation sites should include an analysis of business moving problems.

 5. Consideration of any special relocation advisory services that may be necessary and the agencies that will provide them.

 B. Relocation assistance advisory services.

 1. General. The Department shall carry out a relocation assistance advisory program that offers the services described in subsection B2 of this section. If the Department determines that a Person occupying property adjacent to the real property acquired for the Program or Project is caused substantial economic injury because of such Acquisition, it may offer advisory services to such Person.

 2. Services to be provided. The advisory program shall include such measures, facilities, and services as may be necessary or appropriate as determined by the Department, to:

 a. Determine, for nonresidential (Businesses, farm and Nonprofit Organizations) displacement, the relocation needs and preferences of each Business, farm and Nonprofit Organization, to be displaced and explain the relocation payments and other assistance for which the Business may be eligible, the related eligibility requirements, and the procedures for obtaining such assistance. This shall include a personal interview with each Business. At a minimum, interviews with displaced Business owners and operators should include the following items:

 (1) The Business's replacement site requirements, current lease terms and other contractual obligations and the financial capacity of the Business to accomplish the move.

 (2) Determination of the need for outside specialists in accordance with Section 20.84.300G(12) that will be required to assist in planning the move, assistance in the actual move, and in the reinstallation of machinery and/or other personal property.

 (3) For Businesses, an identification and resolution of personalty/realty issues. Reasonable efforts must be made to identify and resolve realty/personalty issues prior to, or at the time of, the appraisal of the property.

 (4) An estimate of the time required for the Business to vacate the site.

 (5) An estimate of the anticipated difficulty in locating a replacement property.

 (6) An identification of any advance relocation payments required for the move, and the Department's legal capacity to provide them.

 b. Determine, for residential displacements, the relocation needs and preferences of each Person to be displaced and explain the relocation payments and other assistance for which the Person may be eligible, the related eligibility requirements, and the procedures for obtaining such assistance. This shall include a personal interview with each residential Displaced Person.

 (1) Provide current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of Comparable Replacement Dwellings, and explain that the Person cannot be required to move unless at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available.

 (2) As soon as feasible, the Department shall inform the Person in writing of the specific Comparable Replacement Dwelling, the price or rent used for establishing the upper limit of the replacement housing payment, and the basis for the determination, so that the Person is aware of the maximum replacement housing payment for which the Person may qualify.

 (3) Where feasible, housing shall be inspected prior to being made available to assure that it meets applicable standards. If such an inspection is not made, the Department shall notify the Person to be displaced that a replacement housing payment may not be made unless the replacement Dwelling is subsequently inspected and determined to be Decent, Safe, and Sanitary.

 (4) Whenever possible, minority Persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwellings that are not located in an area of minority concentration and that are within their financial means. This does not require a Department to provide a Person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a Person to relocate to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling.

 (5) The Department shall offer all Persons, transportation to inspect housing to which they are referred.

 (6) Any Displaced Person that may be eligible for government housing assistance at the replacement Dwelling shall be advised of any requirements of such government housing assistance program that would limit the size of the replacement Dwelling, as well as of the long term nature of such rent subsidy, and the limited (42 month) duration of the relocation rental assistance payment.

 c. Provide, for nonresidential moves, current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of suitable commercial and farm properties and locations. Assist any Person displaced from a Business or Farm Operation to obtain and become established in a suitable replacement location.

 d. Minimize hardships to Persons in adjusting to relocation by providing counseling, advice as to other sources of assistance that may be available, and such other help as may be appropriate by the Department.

 e. Supply Persons to be displaced with appropriate information, as determined by the Department, concerning federal, state and local housing programs, disaster loan and other programs administered by the Small Business Administration, and other federal, state and local programs offering assistance to Displaced Persons, as well as technical help to Persons applying for such assistance.

 C. Coordination of relocation activities. Relocation activities shall be coordinated with other Project work so that, to the extent feasible, Persons displaced receive consistent treatment and duplication of functions is minimized.

 D. Advisory services for Persons not displaced. Any Person who occupies property acquired by a Department, when such occupancy began subsequent to the Acquisition of the property, and the occupancy is permitted by a short term rental agreement or an agreement subject to termination when the property is needed for a Program or Project, shall be eligible for advisory services, as determined by the Department, even if not eligible for relocation assistance.

 Section 19. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.330, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.330 Fixed Payment for Moving Expenses--Nonresidential Moves.

 A. Business. A displaced Business may be eligible to choose a fixed payment in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses provided by Sections 20.84.300 and 20.84.320. The payment, except for payment to a Nonprofit Organization, shall equal the average annual net earnings of the Business, computed in accordance with subsection E of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. The displaced Business is eligible for the payment if the Department determines that:

 1. The Business owns or rents personal property that must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be incurred in such move; and the Business vacates or relocates from its displacement site;

 2. The Business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A Business is assumed to meet this test unless the Department determines that it will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage;

 3. The Business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other entities that are not being acquired by the Department, and that are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar Business activities;

 4. The Business is not operated at a displacement Dwelling solely for the purpose of renting such Dwelling to others;

 5. The Business is not operated at the displacement site solely for the purpose of renting the site to others; and

 6. The Business Contributed Materially to the income of the Displaced Person.

 B. Determining the number of Businesses. In determining whether two or more displaced legal entities constitute a single Business that is entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which:

 1. The same premises and equipment are shared;

 2. Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;

 3. The entities are held out to the public, and to those customarily dealing with them, as one Business; and

 4. The same Person or closely related Persons own, control, or manage the affairs of the entities.

 C. Farm Operation. A displaced Farm Operation may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with subsection E of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. In the case of a partial Acquisition of land that was a Farm Operation before the Acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Department determines that:

 1. The Acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be displaced from the Farm Operation on the remaining land; or

 2. The partial Acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the Farm Operation.

 D. Nonprofit Organization. A displaced Nonprofit Organization may choose a fixed payment of $1,000 to $20,000 in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, if the Department determines that it cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing patronage (membership or clientele). A Nonprofit Organization is assumed to meet this test unless the Department demonstrates otherwise. Any payment in excess of $1,000 must be supported with financial statements for the two 12-month periods prior to the Acquisition. The amount to be used for the payment is the average of two years annual gross revenues less administrative expenses. (See Appendix A, 49 CFR section 24.305(d).)

 E. Average annual net earnings of a Business or Farm Operation. The average annual net earnings of a Business or Farm Operation are one-half of its net earnings before federal, state, and local income taxes during the 2 taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it was displaced. If the Business or farm was not in operation for the full 2 taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on the actual period of operation at the displacement site during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. Average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Department determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the Business or Farm Operation by its Owner, the Owner's spouse, and dependents. The Displaced Person shall furnish the Department proof of net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable evidence the Department determines is satisfactory.

 Section 20. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.400, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.400 Replacement Housing Payment for 180-day Homeowner- occupants.

 A. Eligibility. A Displaced Person is eligible for the replacement housing payment for a 180-day homeowner-occupant if the Person:

 1. Has actually owned and occupied the displacement Dwelling for not less than the 180 days immediately prior to the Initiation of Negotiations; and

 2. Purchases and occupies a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling within one year after the later of the following dates (except that the Department may extend such one year period for good cause):

 a. The date the Displaced Person receives final payment for the displacement Dwelling or, in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount of just compensation is deposited in the court, or

 b. The date the obligation to make a Comparable Replacement Dwelling available is met.

 B. Amount of payment. The replacement housing payment for an eligible 180-day homeowner-occupant may not exceed $22,500. The payment is limited to the amount necessary to relocate to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling within one year from the date the displaced homeowner-occupant is paid for the displacement Dwelling, or the date a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available to such Person, whichever is later. The payment shall be the sum of:

 1. The amount by which the cost of a replacement Dwelling exceeds the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling (price differential), determined in accordance with subsection C of this section; and

 2. The increased interest costs and other debt service costs that are incurred in connection with the Mortgage(s) or other purchase loan on the replacement Dwelling, determined in accordance with subsection D of this section; and

 3. The necessary and reasonable expenses incidental to the purchase of the replacement Dwelling, determined in accordance with subsection E of this section.

 C. Price differential.

 1. Basic computation. The price differential to be paid under subsection B1 of this section is the amount that must be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling and site to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:

 a. The reasonable cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling determined in accordance with Section 20.84.420; or

 b. The purchase price of the Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the Displaced Person.

 2. Owner retention of displacement Dwelling. If the Owner retains ownership of his or her Dwelling, moves it from the displacement site, and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the purchase price of the replacement Dwelling shall be the sum of:

 a. The cost of moving and restoring the Dwelling to a condition comparable to that prior to the move; and

 b. The cost of making the unit a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling; and

 c. The current market value for residential use of the replacement site, unless the claimant rented the displacement site and there is a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to rent a suitable replacement site; and

 d. The retention value of the Dwelling, if such retention value is reflected in the "acquisition cost" used when computing the replacement housing payment.

 D. Increased Mortgage interest costs. The Department shall determine the factors to be used in computing the amount to be paid to a Displaced Person under subsection B2 of this section. The payment for increased Mortgage interest cost shall be the amount that will reduce the balance on a new purchase loan or Mortgage to an amount that could be amortized with the same monthly payment for principal and interest as that for the Mortgage(s) on the displacement Dwelling. In addition, payments shall include other debt service costs, if not paid as incidental costs, and shall be based only on bona fide Mortgages that were valid liens on the displacement Dwelling for at least 180 days prior to the Initiation of Negotiations. Subsections D1 through D5 of this section apply to the computation of the increased Mortgage interest cost payment, which payment shall be contingent upon a Mortgage or other purchase loan being placed on the replacement Dwelling.

 1. The payment shall be based on the unpaid Mortgage balance(s) on the displacement Dwelling; however, in the event the Person obtains a smaller Mortgage or purchase loan than the Mortgage balance(s) computed in the buydown determination, the payment will be prorated and reduced accordingly. In the case of a home equity loan the unpaid balance is the balance that existed 180 days prior to the Initiation of Negotiations or the balance on the date of Acquisition, whichever is less.

 2. The payment shall be based on the remaining term of the Mortgage(s) on the displacement Dwelling or the term of the new Mortgage or purchase loan, whichever is shorter.

 3. The interest rate on the new Mortgage or purchase loan used in determining the amount of the payment shall not exceed the prevailing fixed interest rate for conventional Mortgages currently charged by Mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the replacement Dwelling is located.

 4. Purchaser's points and loan origination or assumption fees, but not seller's points, shall be paid to the extent:

 a. They are not paid as incidental expenses;

 b They do not exceed rates normal to similar real estate transactions in the area;

 c. The Department determines them to be necessary; and

 d. The computation of such points and fees is based on the unpaid Mortgage balance on the displacement Dwelling, less the amount determined for the reduction of such Mortgage balance under this section.

 5. The Displaced Person shall be advised of the approximate amount of this payment and the conditions that must be met to receive the payment as soon as the facts relative to the Person's current Mortgage(s) are known. The payment shall be made available at or near the time of closing on the replacement Dwelling in order to reduce the new Mortgage or purchase loan as intended.

 E. Incidental expenses. The incidental expenses to be paid under subsection B3 of this section or for downpayment assistance under Section 20.84.410C are those necessary and reasonable costs actually incurred by the Displaced Person incident to the purchase of a replacement Dwelling, and customarily paid by the buyer, including the following costs, but limited to the lesser of the amount actually paid or the amount that would have been paid based on the cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling:

 1. Legal, closing, and related costs, including those for title search, preparing conveyance instruments, notary fees, preparing surveys and plats, and recording fees;

 2. Lender, FHA, or VA application and appraisal fees;

 3. Loan origination or assumption fees that do not represent prepaid interest;

 4. Professional home inspection, certification of structural soundness and termite inspection;

 5. Credit report;

 6. Owner 's and Mortgagee's evidence of title, e.g., title insurance, not to exceed the costs for a Comparable Replacement Dwelling;

 7. Escrow agent's fee;

 8. State revenue or documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes (not to exceed the costs for a Comparable Replacement Dwelling); and

 9. Such other costs as the Department determines to be incidental to the purchase.

 F. Rental assistance payment for 180-day homeowner. A 180-day homeowner-occupant who could be eligible for a replacement housing payment under subsection A of this section but elects to rent a replacement Dwelling, is eligible for a rental assistance payment not to exceed $5,250, computed and disbursed in accordance with Section 20.84.410.

 Section 21. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.410, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.410 Replacement Housing Payment for 90-day Occupants.

 A. Eligibility. A Tenant or Owner-occupant displaced from a Dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance, computed in accordance with subsection B of this section, or down payment assistance, computed in accordance with subsection C of this section, if such Displaced Person:

 1. Has actually and lawfully occupied the displacement Dwelling for at least 90 days immediately prior to the Initiation of Negotiations; and

 2. Has rented, or purchased, and occupied a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling within 1 year (unless the Department extends this period for good cause) after:

 a. For a Tenant, the date he or she moves from the displacement Dwelling, or

 b. For an Owner-occupant, the later of:

 (1) The date the Owner receives final payment for the displacement Dwelling, or in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount is deposited with the court; or

 (2) The date the Owner moves from the displacement Dwelling.

 B. Rental assistance payment.

 1. Amount of payment. An eligible Displaced Person who rents a replacement Dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance. Such payment shall be 42 times the amount obtained by subtracting the base monthly rental for the displacement Dwelling from the lesser of:

 a. The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for a Comparable Replacement Dwelling; or

 b. The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for the Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling actually occupied by the Displaced Person.

 2. Base monthly rental for displacement Dwelling. The base monthly rental for the displacement Dwelling is the lesser of:

 a. The average monthly cost for rent and utilities at the displacement Dwelling for a reasonable period prior to displacement, as determined by the Department. (For an Owner- occupant, use the market rent for the displacement Dwelling. For a Tenant who paid below market rent for the displacement Dwelling, use the market rent, unless its use would result in a hardship because of the Person's income or other circumstances); or

 b. Thirty (30) percent of the Displaced Person's average monthly gross Household Income if the amount is classified as "low income" by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Survey of Income Limits for the Public Housing and Section 8 programs. The base monthly rental shall be established solely on the criteria in subsection B2a of this section for Persons with income exceeding the survey's "low income" limits, for Persons refusing to provide appropriate evidence of income, as determined by the Department, and for Persons who are dependents. A full time student or resident of an institution may be assumed to be a dependent, unless the Person demonstrates otherwise; or

 c. The total of the amounts designated for shelter and utilities if the Displaced Person is receiving a welfare assistance payment from a program that designates the amounts for shelter and utilities.

 3. Manner of disbursement. A rental assistance payment may, at the Department's discretion, be disbursed in either a lump sum or in installments. However, except as limited by Section 20.84.420 F providing for payments after death, the full amount vests immediately, whether or not there is any later change in the Person's income or rent, or in the condition or location of the Person's housing.

 C. Down payment assistance payment.

 1. Amount of payment. An eligible Displaced Person who purchases a replacement Dwelling is entitled to a down payment assistance payment in the amount the Person would receive under subsection B of this section if the Person rented a Comparable Replacement Dwelling. At the discretion of the Department, a down payment assistance payment that is less than $5,250 may be increased to any amount not to exceed $5,250. However, the payment to a displaced homeowner shall not exceed the amount the Owner would receive under Section 20.84.400 if he or she met the 180-day occupancy requirement. If the Department elects to provide the maximum payment of $5,250 as a downpayment, the Department shall exercise this discretion in a uniform and consistent manner, so that eligible Displaced Persons in like circumstances are treated equally. A Displaced Person eligible to receive a payment as a 180-day Owner- occupant under Section 20.84.400 is not eligible for this payment.

 2. Application of payment. The full amount of the replacement housing payment for down payment assistance must be applied to the purchase price of the replacement Dwelling and related incidental expenses.

 Section 22. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.420, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.420 Additional Rules Governing Replacement Housing Payments.

 A. Determining cost of Comparable Replacement Dwelling. The upper limit of a replacement housing payment shall be based on the cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling.

 1. If available, at least three Comparable Replacement Dwellings shall be examined and the payment computed on the basis of the Dwelling most nearly representative of, and equal to, or better than, the displacement Dwelling. An adjustment shall be made to the asking price of any Dwelling, to the extent justified by local market data. An obviously overpriced Dwelling may be ignored.

 2. If the site of the Comparable Replacement Dwelling lacks a major exterior attribute of the displacement Dwelling Site, (e.g., the site is significantly smaller or does not contain a swimming pool), the value of such attribute shall be subtracted from the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling for purposes of computing the replacement housing payment.

 3. If the Acquisition of a portion of a typical residential property causes the displacement of the Owner from the Dwelling and the remainder is a buildable residential lot, the Department may offer to purchase the entire property. If the Owner refuses to sell the remainder to the Department, the market value of the remainder may be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling for purposes of computing the replacement housing payment.

 4. To the extent feasible, Comparable Replacement Dwellings shall be selected from the neighborhood in which the displacement Dwelling was located or, if that is not possible, in nearby or similar neighborhoods where housing costs are generally the same or higher.

 5. Multiple occupants of one displacement Dwelling. If two or more occupants of the displacement Dwelling move to separate replacement Dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable prorated share, determined by the Department, of any relocation payments that would have been made if the occupants moved together to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling. However, if the Department determines that two or more occupants maintained separate households within the same Dwelling, such occupants have separate entitlements to relocation payments.

 6. Deductions from relocation payments. A Department shall deduct the amount of any advance relocation payment from the relocation payment(s) to which a Displaced Person is otherwise entitled. Where such a deduction would not prevent the Displaced Person from obtaining a Comparable Replacement Dwelling, a Department may deduct from relocation payments any rent that the Displaced Person owes the Department. The Department shall not withhold any part of a relocation payment to a Displaced Person to satisfy an obligation to any other creditor.

 7. Mixed-use and multifamily properties. If the Displacement Dwelling was part of a property that contained another Dwelling unit and/or space used for non-residential purposes, and/or is located on a lot larger than typical for residential purposes, only that portion of the acquisition payment that is actually attributable to the displacement Dwelling shall be considered the acquisition cost when computing the replacement housing payment.

 B. Inspection of replacement Dwelling. Before making a replacement housing payment or releasing the initial payment from escrow, the Department or its designated representative shall inspect the replacement Dwelling and determine whether it is a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling.

 C. Purchase of replacement Dwelling. A Displaced Person is considered to have met the requirement to purchase a replacement Dwelling, if the Person:

 1. Purchases a Dwelling;

 2. Purchases and rehabilitates a substandard Dwelling;

 3. Relocates a Dwelling which he or she owns or purchases;

 4. Constructs a Dwelling on a site he or she owns or purchases;

 5. Contracts for the purchase or construction of a Dwelling on a site provided by a builder or on a site the Person owns or purchases; or

 6. Currently owns a previously purchased Dwelling and site, valuation of which shall be on the basis of current market value.

 D. Occupancy requirements for displacement or replacement Dwelling. No Person shall be denied eligibility for a replacement housing payment solely because the Person is unable to meet the occupancy requirements set forth in this ordinance for a reason beyond his or her control, including:

 1. A disaster, an emergency, or an imminent threat to the public health or welfare, as determined by the President, a federal, state or local agency authorized to make such a determination, or the Department; or

 2. Another reason, such as a delay in the construction of the replacement Dwelling, military duty, or hospital stay, as determined by the Department.

 E. Conversion of payment. A Displaced Person who initially rents a replacement Dwelling and receives a rental assistance payment under Section 20.84.410 B is eligible to receive a payment under Section 20.84.400 or Section 20.84.410 C if he or she meets the eligibility criteria for such payments, including purchase and occupancy within the prescribed 1-year period. Any portion of the rental assistance payment that has been disbursed shall be deducted from the payment computed under either of those sections.

 F. Payment after death. A replacement housing payment is personal to the Displaced Person and upon his or her death the undisbursed portion of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or assigns, except that:

 1. The amount attributable to the Displaced Person's period of actual occupancy of the replacement housing shall be paid.

 2. Any remaining payment shall be disbursed to the remaining family members of the displaced household who continue to occupy the replacement Dwelling in any case in which a member of a displaced family dies.

 3. Any portion of a replacement housing payment necessary to satisfy the legal obligation of an estate in connection with the selection of a replacement Dwelling by or on behalf of a deceased Person shall be disbursed to the estate.

 G. Insurance proceeds. To the extent necessary to avoid duplicate compensation, the amount of any insurance proceeds received by a Person in connection with a loss to the displacement Dwelling due to a catastrophic occurrence (fire, flood, etc.) shall be included in the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling when computing the price differential.

 Section 23. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.430, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.430. Replacement Housing of Last Resort.

 A. Determination to provide replacement housing of last resort. Whenever the Department determines that a Program or Project cannot proceed on a timely basis because Comparable Replacement Dwellings are not available within the monetary limits for Owners or Tenants specified in Section 20.84.400 or Section 20.84.410, the Department is authorized to take cost effective measures under the provisions of this section to provide such a Dwelling. The Department's obligation to make available a Comparable Replacement Dwelling shall be met when such a Dwelling, or assistance necessary to provide such a Dwelling, is offered under the provisions of this section. Any decision to provide last resort housing assistance must be adequately justified either:

 1. On a case-by-case basis, for good cause, which means that appropriate consideration, as determined by the Department, has been given to:

 a. The availability of Comparable Replacement Dwellings in the Program or Project area; and

 b. The resources available to provide Comparable Replacement Dwellings; and

 c. The individual circumstances of the Displaced Person; or

 2. By a determination that:

 a. There are few, if any, Comparable Replacement Dwellings available to Displaced Persons within an entire Program or Project area; and, therefore, last resort housing assistance is necessary for the area as a whole; and

 b. A Program or Project cannot be advanced to completion in a timely manner without last resort housing assistance; and

 c. The method selected for providing last resort housing assistance is cost effective, considering all elements that contribute to total Program or Project costs. (For example, will the Project or Program delay justify waiting for less expensive Comparable Replacement Dwellings to become available?)

 B. Basic rights of Persons to be displaced. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no Person shall be required to move from a displacement Dwelling unless comparable replacement housing is available to such Person. No Person may be deprived of any rights the Person may have under this chapter. The Department shall not require any Displaced Person to accept a Dwelling provided by the Department under these procedures (unless the Department and the Displaced Person have entered into a contract to do so) in lieu of any acquisition payment or any relocation payment for which the Person may otherwise be eligible.

 C. Methods of providing replacement housing of last resort. The Department shall have broad latitude in implementing this section, but implementation shall be for reasonable cost, on a case- by-case basis unless an exception to case-by-case analysis is justified for an entire Program or Project.

 1. The methods of providing replacement housing of last resort include, but are not limited to:

 a. A replacement housing payment in excess of the limits set forth in Section 20.84.400 or Section 20.84.410. A replacement housing payment under this section may be provided in installments or in a lump sum at the Department's discretion.

 b. Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement Dwelling.

 c. Construction of a new replacement Dwelling.

 d. Provision of a direct loan that requires regular amortization or deferred repayment. The loan may be unsecured or secured by the real property. The loan may bear interest or be interest-free.

 e. Relocation and, if necessary, rehabilitation of a Dwelling.

 f. Purchase of land and/or a replacement Dwelling by the Department and subsequent sale or lease to, or exchange with a Displaced Person.

 g. Removal of barriers for Persons with disabilities.

 h. Change in status of the Displaced Person with his or her concurrence from Tenant to homeowner when it is more cost effective to do so, as in cases where a downpayment may be less expensive than a last resort rental assistance payment.

 2. Under special circumstances, consistent with the definition of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling, modified methods of providing replacement housing of last resort permit consideration of replacement housing based on space and physical characteristics different from those in the displacement Dwelling, including upgraded, but smaller replacement housing that is Decent, Safe, and Sanitary and adequate to accommodate individuals or families displaced from marginal or substandard housing with probable functional obsolescence. In no event, however, shall a Displaced Person be required to move into a Dwelling that is not functionally equivalent.

 3. The Department shall provide assistance under this section to a Displaced Person who is not eligible to receive a replacement housing payment under Section 20.84.400 and Section 20.84.410 because of failure to meet the length of occupancy requirement when comparable replacement rental housing is not available at rental rates within the Person's financial means, which is 30 percent of the Person's gross monthly Household Income. Such assistance shall cover a period of 42 months.

 D. The actual amount of assistance shall be limited to the amount necessary to relocate to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling within 1 year from the date the displaced homeowner-occupant is paid for the displacement Dwelling or the date the Person is initially offered a Comparable Replacement Dwelling, whichever is later.

 E. The Department is not required to provide Persons owning only a fractional interest in the displacement Dwelling a greater level of assistance to purchase a replacement dwelling than the Department would be required to provide such Persons if they owned fee simple title to the displacement Dwelling. If such assistance is not sufficient to buy a replacement Dwelling, the Department may provide additional purchase assistance or rental assistance.

 Section 24. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.500, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.500 Relocation Assistance-Mobile Homes.

 A. Except as otherwise provided by Sections 20.84.510 through 20.84.530, a Person displaced from a Mobile Home and/or mobile home site who meets the basic eligibility requirements of this chapter is entitled to a moving expense payment and a replacement housing payment to the same extent and subject to the same requirements as Persons displaced from conventional Dwellings. Eligible moving cost payments to Persons occupying Mobile Homes are listed in Section 20.84.300 G (1)- G (10).

 B. Partial Acquisition of a mobile home park. The Acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a remaining part of the property that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. If the Department determines that a Mobile Home located in the remaining part of the property must be moved as a direct result of the Program or Project, the occupant of the Mobile Home shall be considered a Displaced Person who is entitled to relocation payments and other assistance under this chapter.

 Section 25. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.510, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.510 Replacement Housing Payment for 180-day Mobile Homeowner Displaced from a Mobile Home, and/or from the Acquired Mobile Home Site.

 A. An Owner-occupant displaced from a Mobile Home or site is entitled to a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $22,500, under Section 20.84.400 if:

 1. The Person occupied the Mobile Home as a Dwelling on the displacement site for at least 180 days immediately before:

 a. The Initiation of Negotiations to acquire the Mobile Home, if the Person owned the Mobile Home and the Mobile Home is real property under state law;

 b. The Initiation of Negotiations to acquire the mobile home site if the Mobile Home is personal property under state law, but the Person owns the mobile home site;

 c. The date of the Department's written notification to the Owner-occupant that the Owner is determined to be displaced from the Mobile Home as described in subsections A 3(a-d) of this section.

 2. The Person meets the other basic eligibility requirements of Section 20.84.400 A; and

 3. The Department acquires the Mobile Home as real estate, or acquires the mobile home site from the displaced Owner, or the Mobile Home used as a Dwelling is personal property under state law but the Owner is displaced from the Mobile Home because the Department determines that the Mobile Home:

 a. Is not and cannot economically be made Decent, Safe, and Sanitary;

 b. Cannot be relocated without substantial damage or unreasonable cost;

 c. Cannot be relocated because there is no available comparable replacement site; or

 d. Cannot be relocated because it does not meet mobile home park entrance requirements.

 B. Replacement housing payment computation for a 180-day Owner who is displaced from a Mobile Home. The replacement housing payment for an eligible displaced 180-day Owner is computed as described in Section 20.84.400B incorporating the following, as applicable:

 1. If the Department acquires the Mobile Home as real estate and/or acquires the Mobile Home site, the acquisition cost used to compute the price differential payment is the actual amount paid to the Owner as just compensation for the Acquisition of the Mobile Home, and/or site, if owned by the displaced mobile homeowner.

 2. If the Department does not purchase the Mobile Home as real estate but the Owner is determined to be displaced from the Mobile Home and eligible for a replacement housing payment based on subsection A1a of this section, the eligible price differential payment for the purchase of a comparable replacement Mobile Home, is the lesser of the displaced mobile homeowner's net cost to purchase a replacement Mobile Home (i.e., purchase price of the replacement Mobile Home less trade-in or sale proceeds of the displacement Mobile Home); or, the cost of the Department selected comparable Mobile Home less the Department's estimate of the salvage or trade-in value for the Mobile Home from which the Person is displaced.

 3. If a comparable replacement mobile home site is not available, the price differential payment shall be computed on the basis of the reasonable cost of a conventional Comparable Replacement Dwelling.

 C. Rental Assistance payment for a 180-day Owner-occupant who is displaced from a leased or rented mobile home site. If the displacement mobile home site is leased or rented, a displaced 180- day Owner-occupant is entitled to a rental assistance payment computed as described in Section 20.84.410B. This rental assistance payment may be used to lease a replacement site; may be applied to the purchase price of a replacement site; or may be applied, with any replacement housing payment attributable to the Mobile Home, to the purchase of a replacement Mobile Home or conventional Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling.

 D. Owner-occupant not displaced from the Mobile Home. If the Department determines that a Mobile Home is personal property and may be relocated to a comparable replacement site, but the Owner-occupant elects not to do so, the Owner is not entitled to a replacement housing payment for the purchase of a replacement Mobile Home. However, the Owner is eligible for moving costs described in Section 20.84.300 and any replacement housing payment for the purchase or rental of a comparable site as described in this section or Section 20.84.520 as applicable.

 Section 26. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.520, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.520 Replacement Housing Payment for 90-day Mobile Home Occupants.

 A displaced Tenant or Owner-occupant of a Mobile Home used as a Dwelling and/or site is eligible for a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $5,250, under Section 20.84.410 if:

 A. The Person actually occupied the displacement Mobile Home and used it as a Dwelling on the displacement site for at least the 90 days immediately prior to the Initiation of Negotiations;

 B. The Person meets the other basic eligibility requirements of Section 20.84.410 A; and

 C. The Department acquires the Mobile Home and/or mobile home site, or the Mobile Home is not acquired by the Department but the Department determines that the occupant is displaced from the Mobile Home because of one of the circumstances described in Section 20.84.510 A3.

 Section 27. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.620, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.620. Assurances, Monitoring and Corrective Action.

 A. Assurances. Before The City approves any grant to, or contract or agreement with an Agency under which City Financial Assistance will be made available for a Program or Project that may result in a Displaced Person under this chapter, the Agency must provide appropriate assurances to the City that it will comply with and be responsible for compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

 B. Monitoring and corrective action. The Department Head responsible for the contract is authorized to monitor compliance with this chapter. Upon notice and request from the Department Head, the Agency shall take the corrective action requested or necessary to comply with this chapter.

 C. Prevention of fraud, waste, and mismanagement. The Agency shall take appropriate measures to carry out this chapter in a manner that minimizes fraud, waste, and mismanagement.

 Section 28. A new section, SMC Section 20.84.630, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 20.84.630 Recordkeeping and Reports.

 A. Records. An Agency shall maintain adequate records of its displacement activities in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this chapter. These records shall be retained for at least 3 years after the displacement occurs.

 B. Confidentiality of records. Unless otherwise provided by law, records maintained by an Agency in accordance with this chapter are confidential, except that they may be made available to the Department to determine compliance with this chapter.

 C. Reports. An Agency shall submit a report of its displacement activities under this chapter when requested by the City Department Head. Normally, such reports will be submitted every 3 years, unless the Department Head requests a report more frequently.
