 AN ORDINANCE relating to the South Lake Union Streetcar; stating the City's intent concerning funding of capital and operating costs; authorizing negotiations for streetcar vehicles, negotiations for an interlocal agreement with King County Metro, preparation of the final design for the streetcar and preparation of a Local Improvement District proposal; removing budget provisos that had restricted spending on the South Lake Union Streetcar project; authorizing a funding agreement with King County and the deposit of funds to be received; contingently increasing an appropriation to the Seattle Department of Transportation; amending the 2005-2010 Capital Improvement Program; reappropriating from the Legislative Department to the Seattle Department of Transportation; and transferring cash to support the reappropriation.

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 30610, the Seattle City Council affirmed its commitment to support the redevelopment of the South Lake Union area as the region's most competitive location for biotech and high-tech research and manufacturing; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council has taken numerous actions in support of the redevelopment of South Lake Union for this purpose, including selling City property in South Lake Union to enable its redevelopment, approving zoning adjustments that support biotech, allowing certain modifications to building height restrictions, adding South Lake Union to the City's multi-family tax exemption program, contributing to the development of 226 low-income housing units, and contributing funds towards the development and improvement of South Lake Union Park and Cascade Playground; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has designated South Lake Union an Urban Center, which is an area of concentrated employment and housing that should have direct access to high capacity transit; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is proposing to build a modern streetcar between Westlake Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, serving downtown, the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Streetcar will link South Lake Union and the Denny Triangle to the multi-modal transit hub at Westlake; and

 WHEREAS, this South Lake Union Streetcar line was identified as "the single most promising line" in the June 2004 Seattle Streetcar Network and Feasibility Analysis; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Streetcar should be an integral part of an overall Seattle Streetcar Network that could extend to other Seattle neighborhoods; and

 WHEREAS, the Council has previously expressed interest in expanding existing streetcar lines further east on Jackson Street, through the International District and Central District; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Street car line could possibly extend further south to connect with the Waterfront Streetcar line and an extended streetcar line through the International District and Central District to form the beginning of a streetcar network; and

 WHEREAS, it is projected that the South Lake Union Streetcar will carry 330,000 to 380,000 passengers in its first year of operations, eventually growing to over 1,000,000 passengers per year as South Lake Union develops more fully; and

 WHEREAS, in August, 2004, the Seattle City Council directed the Executive, through Ordinance 121565, to complete 30% design and engineering and develop a funding plan to pay for the capital and operations and maintenance costs of the proposed South Lake Union Streetcar; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive has completed 30% design and engineering for the South Lake Union Streetcar; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive has proposed both a capital finance plan and an on-going operations and maintenance funding plan, filed under Clerk File 307392; and

 WHEREAS, no funds from the City's General Fund will be used to pay for the capital and operations and maintenance costs associated with the South Lake Union Streetcar except for: funds from the sale of City properties in South Lake Union, revenues specifically devised to pay for the South Lake Union Streetcar's capital and operation and maintenance costs, and potential General Funds needed to pay for the City's assessment for its properties within a Local Improvement District ("LID"); and

 WHEREAS, the initial results of a Special Benefit Study indicate that properties that might be included in a LID for construction of a streetcar line in South Lake Union could reasonably be expected to benefit from such a streetcar line in a cumulative amount between $70- $80 million; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive is pursuing the possibility of extending the City's existing waterfront streetcar line as well as the planned South Lake Union streetcar line and will coordinate planning efforts so that any new extensions or changes result in an efficient and effective transit network within Seattle;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City shall not use General Fund money to pay for either the capital costs or the operations and maintenance costs of a South Lake Union ("SLU") streetcar line except for the following:

 A. Funds from the sale of City surplus property in SLU, consistent with Section 6 below;

 B. Revenues derived from new revenue sources specifically devised to pay for the SLU streetcar's capital or operations and maintenance costs; and

 C. The potential use of General Funds that may be needed to pay for the City's assessment for its properties within a Local Improvement District ("LID").

 Section 2. The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is authorized to complete final design of the SLU Streetcar, including environmental review and permitting tasks. Final design will begin following federal approval of National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) environmental documents.

 Section 3. Following federal approval of NEPA environmental documents, SDOT is authorized to begin negotiations for the purchase of streetcar vehicles. After the formation of a Local Improvement District for the SLU Streetcar project, the City Council expects to authorize the Executive, by future Council ordinance, to proceed with a Maximum Allowable Construction Contract (MACC) with a General Contract Construction Manager and to purchase streetcar vehicles.

 Section 4. The Executive is authorized to begin negotiations with King County Metro on an interlocal operating and funding agreement for the SLU Streetcar. The interlocal agreement should recognize that Seattle's share of additional Metro transit hours is uncertain and that any future increase in service levels for the SLU Streetcar will need to be evaluated against other competing priorities for new transit hours in Seattle. Therefore, the interlocal agreement shall not include automatic triggers for increases in service levels for the SLU Streetcar beyond those needed to operate the streetcar at 15- minute headways for 15-hours a day. In addition, Executive staff shall keep Councilmembers apprised of the negotiations with Metro by providing frequent updates to Councilmembers and Council staff, especially in regard to any policy issues that have financial or transit service hour implications for the City, and prior to finalization of any draft agreement.

 Section 5. The Executive is authorized to prepare a LID proposal for Council consideration at a LID formation hearing and shall keep the Council apprised of its progress by providing frequent updates to Council staff. The capital costs to be paid by assessments imposed on properties within the proposed LID shall be no less than $25 million plus all costs related to the administration, creation, and formation of the LID, including interim financing costs, bond issuance costs, legal costs associated with any protests, and any LID Guaranty Fund. The hearing on a final assessment roll will not occur until after the MACC is signed. The proposed property assessments must be based on the special benefits that properties will receive as a result of the SLU streetcar as determined by a qualified appraiser through a special benefit study. In determining the special benefit to the City's park property within the proposed LID boundaries, the appraiser shall base the determination of special benefit on its continuing, long-term use for public park purposes.

 Section 6. The Seattle City Council expects to appropriate in a future budget $1.5 million for SLU Streetcar construction costs from the SLU Property Proceeds Subaccount established by Ordinance 120411. The Seattle City Council may also appropriate in a future budget up to an additional $3.9 million from the SLU property sale proceeds for potential SLU Streetcar capital cost increases, project cost overruns, and to pay for any capital costs that are not ultimately covered by grant funding. If these funds are not needed to pay for the SLU Streetcar's capital costs, the Council expects to appropriate these funds for other purposes in South Lake Union consistent with Resolution 30334, with an emphasis on necessary bicycle and pedestrian mobility and safety improvements.

 Section 7. The City will continue to pursue grant funding to pay for any capital costs associated with the SLU Streetcars that are not paid for by the LID assessments or other grant funds.

 Section 8. The Seattle City Council directs the Executive to formally solicit potential interest in the sale of development rights above the proposed SLU Streetcar maintenance base no later than December 31, 2005, and to report back to the City Council on the responses received no later than March 31, 2006.

 Section 9. The City Council directs the Executive to solicit interest in station and streetcar sponsorships that are consistent with the City's sign code. The Executive shall propose guidelines for station and streetcar sponsorships for the City Council's review and approval no later than September 30, 2005. The Executive shall not make any commitments or sign any contracts for sponsorships until the City Council has reviewed and approved the proposed sponsorship guidelines.

 Section 10. In the event that projected sponsorship or other revenues proposed by the Executive (filed in Clerk File 307392) to pay for the SLU streetcar's operations and maintenance costs do not materialize or are insufficient to operate the streetcar at 15-minute headways for 15-hours a day, the Executive should pursue alternative funding sources, other than the City's General Fund. The City Council supports exploring the formation of a Parking and Business Improvement Area (commonly referred to as a "BIA") as an alternative source of funding for the SLU streetcar's operations and maintenance costs. The City Council may consider a proposal for the use of streetcar station/shelter advertising. The City Council may also consider supporting the use of new Metro transit hours that Seattle could receive to help fund the SLU Streetcar's operations and maintenance costs, but the allocation of any new hours to the streetcar will need to be weighed against other priorities for Metro transit hours.

 Section 11. The following budget provisos are removed and are no longer restrictions for any purpose, including Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 121333 and Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 121660:
