 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117047 in 1994 transferred jurisdiction of Seattle Center Parking Lot 2, ("Lot 2") legally described in Section 1 of this ordinance, from the Department of Administrative Services to the Seattle Center Department; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Center Master Plan, adopted by City Council Resolution 28210 in 1990, identified the Lot 2 site for future development for the benefit of Seattle Center, including a 1,000 car parking garage; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined with the advice of the Seattle Center Director that the current public use of Lot 2 as a surface parking lot is no longer needed; that public purposes will be satisfied by construction of a replacement parking garage on a portion of the site; and that the site is not needed for Seattle Center's future program needs; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Center Master Plan has been amended to eliminate Lot 2 as part of the Seattle Center campus, but to reflect the presence of a City-owned parking facility on a portion of the property; and

 WHEREAS, Iris, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will purchase Lot 2 at fair market value, as negotiated by the City and Iris; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Center and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have complementary visions and public service goals; and

 WHEREAS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has told the City that, in selecting the Seattle Center Lot 2 site for location of its world headquarters, the foundation shares the City's interest in the long- term well-being of Seattle Center as a civic asset; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Center will need to undertake specific pre-closing development activities in support of the sale of Lot 2, including relocation of the Nate McMillan Basketball Court, the skateboard park, and the Seattle Center waste reduction facility, the initiation of environmental remediation, participation in the parking garage design process, and closing and project management activities to ready the site for transfer; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intent that the existing skateboard park on Lot 2 be relocated to a site that is in the same general area of the city as Seattle Center; that the site be accessible by public transportation; that the skateboard park be relocated or be in the process of being relocated prior to closure of the existing park; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intent that there be an open process including the skateboard community in program and design review of the replacement park, and that appropriate City departments facilitate such a transition and keep the City Council apprised; and

 WHEREAS, it is the Council's intent that the replacement skateboard park be upgraded and technically enhanced to reflect current design standards for new skateboard parks to the extent possible with the additional costs funded through private and/or public sources; and

 WHEREAS, the City intends that the cash proceeds from the sale of Lot 2 pay all costs and Seattle Center capital commitments associated with the sale and development of the Property and that all remaining net cash proceeds be dedicated to purposes benefiting the long-term sustainability of Seattle Center; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of this _____ day of _________, 2005 by and between the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("Seller"), and IRIS Holdings, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Purchaser").

 IN CONSIDERATION of the respective agreements hereinafter set forth, Seller and Purchaser hereby agree as follows:

 1. Purchase and Sale.

 (a) Seller agrees to sell and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Property. As used herein, the term the "Property" shall mean, collectively: (i) that certain parcel of land located in King County, Washington, containing approximately 12.3 acres of land and more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Land"), together with all of Seller's right, title and interest in all rights, easements and interests appurtenant thereto including, but not limited to, any development rights, mineral rights, or other rights owned by, or leased to, Seller; (ii) any and all structures and other improvements located on the Land (all such structures and other improvements being referred to herein as the "Improvements"); (iii) all personal property owned by Seller, located on or in the Land or Improvements and used in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Property (the "Personal Property"), except for the personal property listed on Exhibit C attached hereto, provided Seller removes the same prior to opening of the Parking Facility; and (iv) all permits, approvals, and entitlements and other intangible property used in connection with the foregoing, including, without limitation, all of Seller's right, title and interest in any and all warranties and guaranties relating to the Property but excluding the existing Covenant for Off-Site Accessory Parking related to the Property (the "Intangible Personal Property").

 (b) Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that Purchaser intends to use the Property to construct and erect on the Land an office campus and related improvements ("Purchaser's Project").

 (c) Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the Property is subject to that certain Ground Lease Agreement between Seller and Basketball Club of Seattle, LLC for Seattle SuperSonics Practice Facility dated March 2, 1994 ("SSI Ground Lease"). The SSI Ground Lease is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2010.

 (d) A portion of the Property is presently used for surface parking for the general public, and replacement of such parking is important to the Seller's Seattle Center operations and a condition of the sale of the Property. As such use will be terminated upon the commencement of construction of Purchaser's Project, Seller desires to (i) compensate for the effect of the loss of the existing surface parking by requiring Purchaser to construct a parking structure (the "Parking Facility") on that portion of the Land generally described in the attached Exhibit B (the "Garage Parcel"), which Garage Parcel shall be ground leased by Purchaser to Seller upon completion of the Parking Facility pursuant to that certain Ground Lease (Garage) substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I, (ii) provide parking in the Parking Facility for Purchaser's employees and invitees employed at or visiting Purchaser's Project, and (iii) continue the existing surface parking use during the period from the Closing Date until the Parking Facility is open to the public. To accomplish these objectives, the parties shall enter into (x) an agreement (the "Parking Facility Development Agreement") substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto, to be entered into simultaneously with this Agreement, providing for Purchaser's construction of the Parking Facility on the Garage Parcel, (y) an agreement (the "Parking Operating Agreement") substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto, to be entered into upon completion of the Parking Facility, providing for parking by Purchaser in the Parking Facility, and (z) a lease (the "Temporary Ground Lease (Surface Parking)") substantially in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto, to be entered into at Closing, pursuant to which Purchaser shall lease to Seller commencing on the Closing Date the portion of the Property presently used for surface parking, less the necessary staging area required for construction of the Parking Facility.

 2. Purchase Price.

 (i) Within five (5) days after the mutual execution and delivery hereof, Purchaser shall deposit $1,200,000.00, cash, (the "Deposit") with a title company mutually acceptable to the parties hereto (the "Title Company"), to secure Purchaser's performance hereunder. The term Deposit as used herein, shall mean (i) the above-referenced cash deposited with Title Company and (ii) any Extension Payments made to Title Company to extend the Due Diligence Period as provided in Section 4. Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Title Company shall return the Deposit and any Extension Payments (net of Seller's Reimbursable Expenses) to Purchaser on Purchaser's notification that this Agreement has terminated. Thereafter, if Purchaser instructs Title Company to return the Deposit, then Title Company shall notify Seller of Purchaser's demand and, unless Title Company receives within seven (7) days of the date of Title Company's notice an affidavit from Seller stating that there is a genuine dispute as to which party is entitled to the Deposit and describing the basis of Seller's claim thereto, Title Company shall return the Deposit, net of Seller's Reimbursable Costs, to Purchaser, without any further instructions or authorizations from Seller. Except as provided to the contrary hereinbelow, if Purchaser makes a demand for return of the Deposit and Title Company does receive such an affidavit from Seller within seven (7) days after Title Company's notice, then Title Company shall hold the Deposit in escrow until the dispute as to which party is entitled to the Deposit is resolved. If the Closing does occur, the full amount of the Deposit shall be credited against the Purchase Price at the Closing. Purchaser shall be entitled to the benefit of any interest earned on the Deposit or any extension Payments.

 As used herein, "Seller's Reimbursable Costs" means the actual costs incurred by Seller to undertake activities in advance of Closing to facilitate Purchaser's projected schedule for development of the Property.

The "Seller's Reimbursable Costs" are shown in Column (B) of Schedule I, preceding Exhibit A. Additional predevelopment activities to be undertaken by the City that are not Seller's Reimbursable Costs and for which Seattle Center will be solely responsible and will seek an appropriation at the time the Purchase Agreement is considered are also reflected in Schedule I, Column (C). These activities include initiating design, negotiations, and/or implementing actions for remediation of groundwater contamination; completing pre-Closing project management activities at Purchaser's request; and, completing Seller's responsibilities associated with Closing.

 (a) Seller's Reimbursable Costs shall in no event exceed the total amount of the individual items shown in the attached Schedule I, Column (B) (the "Reimbursable Costs Cap");

 (b) If the parties have not agreed upon or ascertained the amount of Seller's Reimbursable Costs at the time Title Company is required to return the Deposit to Purchaser, Title Company shall return the Deposit net of the Reimbursable Costs Cap to Purchaser, and shall continue to hold an amount of the Deposit equal to the Reimbursable Costs Cap in escrow pending (A) the parties agreement on Seller's Reimbursable Costs, or (B) receipt by Title Company of a court order directing the disposition of the Seller's Reimbursable Costs held by Title Company; and,

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by reason of the willful, intentional, or negligent default of Seller, Seller's Reimbursable Costs shall be zero. Seller shall submit to Purchaser on a quarterly basis an itemized statement, signed by the Seattle Center Director, as to Seller's Reimbursable Costs that have been incurred during the preceding three months and Purchaser shall promptly authorize escrow to release a payment from the Deposit to Seller as payment for such Seller Reimbursable Costs.

 (ii) The balance of the Purchase Price shall consist of::

 8. Closing and Escrow.

 (a) Upon mutual execution of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall deposit an executed counterpart of this Agreement with Title Company and this Agreement shall serve as instructions to Title Company for consummation of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby.

 ARTICLE 3

 GENERAL PROVISIONS

 3.1 The Purchaser intends to buy the Property from the City and construct a Parking Facility on the Parking Facility Site. Following Substantial Completion of the Parking Facility, the Purchaser shall ground lease the Parking Facility Site to the City pursuant to a ground lease (the "Ground Lease"). The Purchaser will convey title to the Parking Facility (meaning the improvement only and not the underlying real property) to the City pursuant to the Deed of Transfer of Ownership attached hereto as Exhibit B. At the end of the ground lease term, ownership of all improvements to the Parking Facility Site, including the Parking Facility, will revert back to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Ground Lease.

 3.2 The Purchaser is undertaking design and construction of the Parking

 Facility on behalf of and in accordance with the City's design and operating requirements, as reflected in Exhibit C. The Purchaser will include 300 Designated Stalls in the Parking Facility; or such number as close as practicable to 300.

 3.3 It is the intent of the Purchaser and the City that the design and construction process shall be a cooperative, mutual endeavor in which the Purchaser and the City work together constructively in all major phases of development of the Project in order to achieve the City's design and operations requirements for the Parking Facilities and to control the cost of development by the Purchaser. The Purchaser will own the Parking Facility during construction. Following Substantial Completion of the Project and conveyance of title as described in paragraph 3.1, the City will be the sole owner of the Parking Facility during the term of the ground lease and, as such, the Purchaser recognizes that the City has a substantial and continuing interest in the design, development and construction of the Parking Facility. Accordingly, as described more specifically below, the Purchaser will use all reasonable efforts to involve the City in all significant aspects and decisions for design and construction of the Parking Facility, including but not limited to, attendance and participation at the City's discretion at major hearings and meetings regarding the Parking Facility's development (other than internal Purchaser meetings), including weekly design and construction meetings with the Project's Design-Builder and/or the Design-Builder's architect, and major meetings with other City officials. Also as described more specifically below, the City shall have the right to specific prior review and approval on the acceptability of: interior and exterior design programs, construction process and staging, and selection of the Design-Builder. The Purchaser will fully and fairly review and make every good faith effort to address satisfactorily the City's concerns prior to making a final decision in any such matters, so long as such input is timely received. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall have the final decision making and management authority on the Project Budget.

 3.4 The Parties agree that they will exercise their best efforts to achieve Substantial Completion of the Parking Facility by May 15, 2007 and Final Project Acceptance of the Parking Facility not later than September 30, 2007. Both Parties recognize, however, that notwithstanding their efforts, the Purchaser's ability to develop and construct a fully operational Parking Facility by that date depends upon actions of the City and other governmental and nongovernmental entities that are beyond control of the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall not be liable to the City for failure of the Parking Facility to be Substantially Completed by May 15, 2007, provided, however that the Temporary Ground Lease for Surface Parking (Exhibit H, Purchase and Sale Agreement, Dated _______2005) shall remain in effect until opening of the Parking Facility to the public, and such opening shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by the City.

 3.5 The City shall pay any costs associated with the City's Project Coordinator's participation in the Project.

 ARTICLE 4

 DESIGN and BUDGET

 4.1 Joint Design and Construction Oversight Team. The Purchaser will manage the design and construction of the Parking Facility in close consultation with the City, in order to meet the City's design and operating requirements as incorporated in the Scope Design Documents. The City has designated the City's Capital Project Coordinator, or his or her designee, as its representative. The Purchaser has designated the Purchaser's Project Manager or his or her designee as its representative. The City's Capital Project Coordinator will have access to the jobsite at all times during construction, subject to reasonable health and safety regulations and the overall control of the Purchaser's Project Manager. The City's Capital Project Coordinator shall be kept informed of all major pending matters by the Purchaser's Project Manager and shall have access to relevant information. The Parties will designate a Joint Design and Construction Oversight Team, to be chaired by the Purchaser's Project Manager. The Joint Design and Construction Oversight Team will consist of (a) representative(s) from the Purchaser, including the Purchaser's Project Manager, and (b) representative(s) from the City including the City's Capital Project Coordinator. This Joint Design and Construction Oversight Team will serve as the primary vehicle for joint monitoring of design review and construction progress and will convene as frequently as necessary to ensure effective collaboration and decision making between the Purchaser and the City. During design, the City's Capital Project Coordinator will receive, review, and approve all design plans and specifications for their conformance with the City's design and operating requirements as incorporated in the Scope Design Documents. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. During construction, the City's Capital Project Coordinator shall receive copies of all submittals and substitutions, modification proposals, RFI's and RFI responses, all construction meeting minutes, and all other documents necessary to enable the City's Capital Project Coordinator to participate fully in monitoring of the design and construction progress. However, any changes the City requests or requires to the design of the Project need to be consistent with the Scope Design Documents.

 4.2 The City agrees to respect the contractual relationships between the Purchaser and the Design-Builder. The City shall use its best efforts to ensure that all verbal and written communications provided to the Design-Builder or its architect, consultants and subcontractors, shall be communicated through the Purchaser's Project Manager.

 4.3 Scope Design and Budget Phase.

 4.3.1 Scope Design Phase. In the Scope Design Phase, the Purchaser will prepare Scope Design Documents. The Scope Design Documents will be subject to the City's approval in its exercise of reasonable discretion. The Scope Design Phase is the stage in which the size and character of the Project is described, including architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical systems, materials, and such other elements as may be appropriate. Where applicable, the Scope Design Documents will incorporate the City's Design, Operations, and Performance Requirements in Exhibit C. It is Seattle Center's expectation that the Parking Facility Design will be consistent with the intent and performance standards of Exhibit C.

 4.3.1.1 At the Scope Design Phase, the Purchaser will seek the active participation of the City and will give the City the continuing opportunity to provide advice, identify City preferences, and ultimately to approve the design for the Parking Facility. The City's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and shall focus primarily on the operational aspects of the Parking Facility. During design, the City's Capital Project Coordinator will receive and review all design plans and specifications for their conformance with the City's design and operating requirements as described in Exhibit C. The City's continuing involvement and consultation in the planning and design of the Parking Facility are intended to ensure that the design of the Parking Facility will be satisfactory to both the City and the Purchaser. Consistent advice and timely participation and/or approvals by the City are prerequisites to this end.

 4.3.1.2 At the end of the Scope Design Phase, the Purchaser shall provide to the City the Scope Design Documents for the City's approval. Within seven (7) business days from the submittal of the Scope Design Documents to the City by the Purchaser, the Parties will evaluate the quality and condition of the drawings and documents and agree on a collaborative review process for obtaining the City's concurrence in a time frame consistent with overall Project schedule requirements. Following completion of this review, the City will provide its written comments on the Scope Design Documents to the Purchaser. If the City fails to produce comments within 10 (ten) business days after completion of the review, the City's concurrence will be deemed to have been granted and the Purchaser will move on to finalizing the Project Budget.

 4.3.1.3 If, after the City's approval of the Scope Design Documents, the City requests changes in the Project design that reflect new program or operating requirements not contemplated in Exhibit C or the Scope Design Documents and that result in an increase in the Project scope or cost, the City shall provide recommendations for off- setting design changes or a commitment of funds to cover such changes, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser. The Parties will collaboratively work to accommodate the City's proposal. However, any such changes are subject to the Purchaser's review and approval to the extent that the City's requirements add a material amount of time to the construction schedule or create a material net increase in cost.

 4.3.2 Project Budget. After the Scope Design Phase is completed, the Purchaser will prepare a Project Budget estimating the total cost of implementing and constructing the Project including the scope of work described in the Scope Design Documents. The Project Budget will include a schedule of values establishing the projected Purchaser's total cost to deliver the Project. The appropriate design and construction parts of the Project Budget amount will be considered the Maximum Allowable Construction Cost that the Purchaser can pay the Design-Builder for designing and constructing the Project and thus will factor into the selection of the Design-Builder under RCW 39.10.051.

 ARTICLE 5

 DESIGN-BUILD AGREEMENT

 5.1 Selection of Design-Builder. After completion of the Scope Design Documents and Project Budget, the parties shall undertake to select a Design-Builder for the Project. In selecting the Design- Builder for the Project, the Purchaser agrees to use a process substantially similar to the public bidding requirements codified in RCW 39.10, including, without limitation, RCW 39.10.030 and 39.10.051.

 The RFP will also include the Maximum Allowable Construction Cost for the Design-Builder's services and a Project schedule for substantial completion.

 5.2 Design-Build Procedures. The City agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser to establish the appropriateness of using the design- build process for constructing and designing the Parking Facility pursuant to the process prescribed by RCW 39.10 et. seq.

 5.3 Other City Procedural Requirements. The City agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser to satisfy any additional procedural requirements necessary for timely completion of the Parking Facility as contemplated herein.

 5.4 Lump Sum Price. The RFP will require that the Design- Builder submit a schedule of values detailing its proposed total cost of its Services. The Design-Builder's proposed Lump Sum Price shall not exceed the Maximum Allowable Construction Cost. If, for any reason, the Purchaser finds that the responses to the RFP do not satisfy the criteria set-forth therein, it shall negotiate with the firm submitting the highest scored best and final proposal. The agreed-upon price that results from these negotiations shall be considered the Design-Builder's Lump Sum Price and will be included in the Design-Build Agreement.

 5.5 Design Review. The City will be afforded the opportunity by the Purchaser throughout the Final Design Phase to receive, review, and comment on preliminary design documents. The City shall provide timely information to the Purchaser and Design-Builder regarding applicable Seattle Center technical requirements and site standards and will ensure that coordination with Seattle Center activities and events occurs effectively.

 5.6 Final Design Phase. In the Final Design Phase, the Design- Builder will prepare Final Design Documents, which will incorporate the scope of work described in the Scope Design Documents and other elements of the RFP.

 5.7 During the Final Design Phase, the Purchaser shall provide to the City the Final Design Documents for the City's review and comment and approval as to their conformance with the City's design and operating requirements as incorporated in the Scope Design Documents. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Within seven (7) business days from the submittal of the Final Design Documents to the City by the Purchaser, the Parties will evaluate the quality and condition of the drawings and documents and agree on a collaborative review process for obtaining the City's concurrence in a time frame consistent with overall Project schedule requirements. Following completion of this review, the City will provide its written comments on the Final Design Documents to the Purchaser. If the City fails to produce comments within ten (10) business days after completion of the review, the City's concurrence will be deemed to have been granted.

 5.8 Prevailing Wages and Other Laws. The RFP will require that the Design-Builder comply with certain Public Works contracting requirements, including, without limitation, the prevailing wage requirements codified in RCW 39.12 et. al. The Purchaser and the City shall mutually agree to include other contracting requirements common to public works projects such as apprentice programs, project labor agreement, encouragement of MWBE/DBE/SBE participation, payment and performance bonds, etc.

 5.9 Liquidated Damages. The Design-Build Agreement will include a liquidated damages clause binding the Design-Builder to reasonable damages in the event it fails to comply with the Project schedule.

 5.10 Seattle Center Technical and Site Standards,. The Purchaser agrees to include in the Design-Build Agreement a requirement that the Design-Builder review and apply the applicable Seattle Center Technical and Site Standards referenced in Exhibit C

 ARTICLE 6

 6.1 Other than the Master Use Permit, which the Purchaser shall obtain, the Design Builder will be responsible for obtaining all Permits required for construction of the Parking Facility and will construct the Parking Facility consistent with the approved Final Design Documents with which the City and the Purchaser will have concurred. The Purchaser shall ensure that the Design-Builder Agreement requires all construction to be performed in a good and workmanlike manner in full compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements using materials in accordance with the Final Design Documents. In overseeing construction of the Parking Facility, the Purchaser shall comply, and cause its agents to comply, with all Legal Requirements. The Purchaser shall ensure that the contract documents require the Design-Builder to cause to be erected and maintained, as required by existing conditions and progress of the construction, all necessary safeguards for safety and protection, including posting danger signs and other warnings against hazards, promulgating safety regulations, and notifying owners and users of properties adjacent to the Site. The Purchaser shall cause the Design-Builder to provide construction fencing (or such other security measures as the Design- Builder deems necessary or appropriate in its reasonable discretion) consistent with Exhibit C.

 6.2 The Parties agree to collaborate to the maximum extent practicable during the construction process without confusing or compromising the Purchaser's working and contractual relationships with its Design-Builder. The Purchaser will make every reasonable effort to cooperate with the City in achieving their shared objective of completing Parking Facility construction on schedule without compromising the quality of the Parking Facility. The City's Capital Project Coordinator will participate in construction progress meetings, receive all meeting minutes, submittals and substitution requests, RFI's and modification proposals or construction change directives. As provided herein, the Purchaser will closely consult with the City in evaluating and resolving proposed change orders and other developments, which may cause any changes in the Project.

 6.3 Change Orders. The Parties acknowledge that events may occur during the course of design and construction that will cause the Design-Builder, the Purchaser, or the City to seek changes in the approved Final Design Documents and/or the cost or schedule of the Project. The following process will be observed in evaluating and resolving such change order proposals.

 6.3.1 Each Party will make reasonable efforts to respond to change order proposals as expeditiously as possible.

 6.3.2 If the Purchaser and City, at any level, do not concur in the disposition of a change order proposal, the Purchaser's recommendation will be considered by the next level of the Parties' representatives until informal review has been exhausted. If possible, consistent with maintaining the Project schedule, any continuing deadlock will be subject to the nonbinding dispute resolution procedures provided in Article 10, or similar nonbinding alternative dispute resolution procedures acceptable to both Parties.

 6.3.3 Following utilization of the procedures provided herein, if City concurrence in the disposition of a change order proposal has been withheld for whatever reason, the Purchaser reserves the right, at the Purchaser's sole cost, to resolve, in its reasonable discretion, any change order when such resolution is necessary and appropriate in order to maintain the Project schedule and/or maintain consistency with the Project Budget. The Purchaser also reserves the right to resolve, in its reasonable discretion without use of the procedures provided herein, any change order proposal or other claim or condition without City concurrence in emergencies which threaten life, health, or safety or potentially entail substantial damage to Parking Facility property. The Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to notify the City prior to making such decision and if the decision would have an adverse affect on the Parking Facility, the Purchaser will use all reasonable efforts to remediate such adverse affect.

 SEATTLE CENTER DESIGN, OPERATIONS, AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR PARKING FACILITY -- PRELIMINARY GUIDELINES

 NOTE: The statement of principles, program requirements, and architectural criteria are preliminary reflections of Seattle Center's perspective on the guidelines for construction of a new Parking Facility. The Parties will work with parking and architectural consultants to more fully develop guidelines and expectations to be included in the Scope Design Documents.

 A. Principles to Guide Design and Architectural Treatment

 1. The design should optimize functionality for user-friendly and efficient operations and quality aesthetic design that makes the garage an interesting and pleasing structure both inside and out.

 2. The design treatment of the garage needs to integrate its identification as an entry point to Seattle Center and a transition from office use to the Seattle Center.

 3. To the extent, there is any above grade structure, the design should enliven and make the facility attractive and iconic. The design features should minimize the perception of bulk, scale, and monotony typical of many garages.

 4. To the extent the Parking Facility includes any surface parking, there must be direct on-site access to the garage structure from the surface parking and visa versa. Any surface parking should be designed to include use of lighting, and landscaping that makes the surface facility attractive and safe.

 5. The design should be based on accepted CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) principles, to ensure safety and security for parked autos and patrons.

 6. The physical design of the site should create an environment that enhances a sense of personal safety and sensitivity to human scale design elements.

 7. The design should respect the pedestrian nature of Seattle Center, and emphasize the creation of a fully accessible, pleasant and welcoming pedestrian experience the minute patrons leave their vehicles - interior and exterior lighting, signage, security and wayfinding are central to meeting this aim.

 8. The design should treat the garage as the users first experience on their visit to Seattle Center and the values of the Center -- customer service, friendliness, safety, community, and respect should be integrated into the design and feel of the interior facilities and exterior of the Parking Facility(ies).

 9. Physical access to the Parking Facility(ies) and to Seattle Center should be clearly apparent to the most casual visitor - in their vehicle and on foot. The site organization should provide safe, convenient, and easily understood access to all. Conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians should be minimized and the pedestrian favored.

 10. The Parking Facility(ies) and signage should be designed to welcome visitors to Seattle Center, inform them of current events at the Center, and make wayfinding to and on Seattle Center's campus clear and easy.

 11. To the extent there is a structured above/below grade garage as part of the Parking Facility(ies), the design should provide flexibility for different parking program requirements for below and above grade floors, including convenient access, security, and independent exclusive use of below grade floors during weekday daytimes and open public use at other times.

 12. The design should consider alternative and optimal paths and designs for below grade, at grade, and above grade pedestrian access to Seattle Center and to adjacent office uses.

 13. To the extent there is an above grade garage structure, the design along the street frontage property lines should use landscaping, street furniture, and entry paths to create an attractive and inviting streetscape. Setback design should consider the context of its location as a major Seattle Center entry point, its impact on adjacent transit waiting/drop-off areas, and relations to street crossings.

 14. The design needs to be informed operationally by the Seattle Center's overall Transportation Program and policies, procedures, operational and equipment standards that are used in the existing operations of Seattle Center's parking operations.

 15. The design should fully review opportunities for including energy efficiency and sustainable building design elements, especially where such elements conserve natural resources and/or can be integrated to create a unique and interesting design feature (e.g. motion-sensor lighting, recycled building materials, creation of a water feature out of rooftop rainwater run-off).

 B. Preliminary Program Elements

 1. Parking for a minimum of 1,010 stalls depending on the final design (including approximately 50 stalls for oversized vehicles and 25 stalls for disabled drivers at grade, if there is an above grade garage and the applicable land use code does not provide otherwise). If the Parking Facilities include a surface lot, this is the area where oversized vehicle and van-accessible disabled stalls should be located.

 2. If the Parking Facility is provided via a garage structure, then the structure shall have a maximum height defined by six above grade floors.

 3. The Parking Facility(ies) design should include the ability to dedicate some areas to secure exclusive daytime use. Consider gated, secured key-card access with capacity to open for public parking during other times.

 4. 4,000 square foot headquarters parking office located on the main at-grade level adjacent to a garage entry and with exterior windows. Space to include restrooms, kitchen/breakroom, five offices, conference area, document storage, secured storage, and equipment storage. Office and attendant spaces must be integrated with Seattle Center telephone and data network.

 5. Include conduit runs for potential sound and CCTV throughout the garage.

 6. Storage/cleaning closet areas (@ 10'X10') with water service on each floor of the garage.

 7. Vehicular access directly to/from 5th Avenue North via the vacated Republican Street driveway, and to/from Harrison Street, with 2 lanes in and two lanes out at each entrance.

 8. Access that minimizes on-street queues for event use.

 9. Target for egress to enable flushing of a capacity garage after an event in less than 30 minutes, with assistance from parking staff and SPD.

 10. Small area reserved for covered bicycle parking.

 11. If Parking Facility(ies) include an above grade garage facility, include provisions along the 5th Avenue N. street frontage that are attractive to pedestrians.

 12. Seattle Center event signage, in the form of an electronic readerboard, located at the 5th and Harrison corner.

 13. Incorporation of advanced technology to allow for automated tracking of occupancy, for use in variable message signs located on inbound roadways to direct patrons to garages with space available.

 14. Integrated self-pay system that takes credit/debit cards, can be monitored from remote location and networks all machines for integrated reporting; use of technology standard, equipment, and vendor already in use in Seattle Center's other parking facilities.

 15. If Purchaser wishes to incorporate a CCTV system as part of the garage security for Designated Stalls while in exclusive use, a security office providing monitoring of the system must be located in or near the parking facility. (Note: This would constitute an Additional O&M Services under the Parking Agreement.)

 C. Selected Architectural Criteria

 1. Physical access to the Parking Facility(ies) should be clearly apparent to the most casual visitor. The site organization should provide safe and convenient access and egress.

 2. Design should minimize conflicts between pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Pedestrian routes through the Parking Facility(ies) should be clearly designated, convenient and well marked.

 3. Design that eases Parking Facility(ies) use and operation, including a self-park/self-pay system and attendant booths at all entrances, using technologies which complement existing or currently planned systems at other Seattle Center parking facilities.

 4. Design must accommodate pay-on-entry, either through attendant or self-pay.

 5. Stall sizes 8 feet in width on all but the ground level; oversize stalls of 9 feet wide, 18 feet long, and clearance of 8'2"; and disabled stalls for cars:9 feet wide with 3 foot pathway on right, 18 feet long, and clearance of 7 feet; for accessible vans: 9 feet wide with 8 foot pathway to the right, 18 feet long, and clearance of 8'2". If the Parking Facility includes a surface parking area, it should be suitable for parking of buses and commercial event trucks when space is available.

 6. Elevator and stair access to all levels of the Parking Facility(ies).

 7. Design that minimizes operational and maintenance costs and creates an integrated operational plan with all of the Center's existing parking facilities.

 8. Longevity of garage (50 year minimum).

 9. Use of landscape, irrigation design and water retention that enhances the existing site and mitigates storm water runoff.

 10. Screen-walls and/or planters to block car headlights.

 11. Maximize natural ventilation and lighting. Design and situate Parking Facility(ies) to avoid spaces that cannot easily be visually monitored by drive through patrols.

 12. The Parking Facility(ies) should be well lit to enhance actual and perceived safety, as well as to create a pleasant environment.

 13. Security phones should be located at pay stations.

 14. Provide high intensity lighting close to the ground for pedestrians and at pay stations and parking attendant transaction locations, and low intensity, elevated lighting for vehicular circulation and parking.

 15. Signage should be attractive, informative, and a little fanciful and should be intended to surprise and delight visitors, as well as inform them.

 D. Seattle Center Technical and Site Standards

 To the extent applicable and appropriate, the Parking Facility Scope Design and Final Design Documents shall incorporate the Seattle Center Technical and Site Standards contained in the volumes entitled "Site Standards" and "General Conditions" and dated December 8, 2004.

 F. The parties entered into the Development Agreement on the condition that upon the completion and opening of the Parking Facility and upon the execution of the Ground Lease (Garage):

 (i) The City would grant to Purchaser, as owner of the Purchaser Parcel, and to occupants of the Benefited Buildings, and their respective employees and invitees, certain rights to park in the Parking Facility, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and

 (ii) The City would covenant, in accordance with the requirements of Seattle Land Use Code Section 23.54.025, that so long as the Benefited Buildings exist, 300 parking stalls ("Covenant Stalls") will be available in full or partial satisfaction of the Purchaser's Land Use Code requirement from the Seattle Center's parking inventory of approximately 3,300 parking stalls, and

 (iii) The City would designate stalls in the Parking Facility equal to

 300 stalls or such greater number of stalls as provided in Section 4 below ("Designated Stalls"), for parking by Purchaser, occupants of the Benefited Buildings, and their respective employees and contractors, and

 (iv) The City would rent additional stalls in the Parking Facility to a maximum of 420 stalls ("Additional Stalls"), available for parking by Purchaser, occupants of the Benefited Buildings, and their respective employees and contractors.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and other good and valuable consideration as provided herein and in the Parking Development Agreement and the Garage Ground Lease, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 1. Grant of Parking Covenant. In partial or full satisfaction of the Purchaser's Land Use Code requirement for provision of parking associated with the Purchaser's development of the Benefited Buildings, the City shall provide the Purchaser with a Covenant for 300 parking stalls from the Seattle Center parking inventory. Consideration for the Covenant stalls is satisfied by the Purchaser's capital cost share of the Total Development Cost of the Parking Facility as represented in the Ground Lease (Garage).

 2. Grant of Parking Rights. City hereby grants to Purchaser, and to any successors and assigns approved by the City (provided, such right of approval shall not affect the right of an successor or assignee as to any rights related to the Designated Stalls, but merely the right to benefit from the payment terms related to the Additional Stalls as set forth below), as owner of the Purchaser Parcel, and to occupants of the Benefited Buildings, and their respective employees and invitees (all as designated by Purchaser) (collectively, the "Benefited Parkers"), during the time periods set forth in Section 3, the following rights to park in the Parking Facility:

 (i) The exclusive right, as defined in Section 4, to use Designated Stalls in the Parking Facility equal in number to 300 stalls, and

 (ii) The right to rent, on a non-exclusive basis as provided in Section 4, Additional Stalls in the Parking Facility in such number as is requested by Purchaser from time to time as provided in Section 3, equal to up to 420 stalls (the "Maximum Additional Stalls"). The parking rights granted in this Section 2 are coupled with a non-exclusive right of ingress and egress to the Parking Facility.

 3. Time Periods. The rights granted in Section 2 shall be exercisable during the hours of 6 AM to 6 PM Monday through Friday, with in-out privileges (the "Designated Hours"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Benefited Parkers shall be entitled to park in the Parking Facility during non-Designated Hours on a non-exclusive, first come, first served basis ("Off-Hours Parking"), but such parking shall be at their individual expense; provided, however, that Benefited Parkers whose continuous daytime stay runs past the Designated Hours will not be assessed an additional charge for exiting after 6 pm. At the Purchaser's request, Seattle Center will design a temporary parking pass program for occasional employee nighttime usage, the terms and price of such program to be negotiated by the parties.

 4. Number of Stalls. It is contemplated that the Benefited Buildings will be constructed in phases, so that the number of Designated Stalls and the Maximum Additional Stalls may increase as construction of additional buildings progresses. Commencing on the Commencement Date (as defined in Section 7) Purchaser will require 300 Designated Stalls or such greater number of Designated Stalls as constructed under the Parking Development Agreement and no Additional Stalls. Purchaser shall give thirty (30) days written notice to City of any increase in the number of Additional Stalls to be rented by Purchaser during the following month, provided that the number so required shall not, without City's consent, exceed the Maximum Additional Stalls.

 5. Location of Stalls. (a) At Purchaser's option, the Designated Stalls shall be located in the Parking Facility in areas (the "Exclusive Use Areas") designated for the exclusive use of Benefited Parkers during the Designated Hours, and to which access is available during Designated Hours only to Benefited Parkers. Access may be so limited through the use of mechanical arms or gates, stickers and card keys issued to Benefited Parkers and/or other similar measures, as determined in the Final Design Documents of the Parking Facilities, as agreed by the Purchaser and the City ("Access Limiting Measures"), and Purchaser and City agree to cooperate in good faith in operating such Access Limiting Measures. Purchaser shall have the right, at its sole expense and with approval of the City, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to alter or change the Access Limiting Measures, including without limitation, the installation of additional gates and/or manned station(s). On the Commencement Date, the Exclusive Use Areas shall be the areas designated on the Parking Facility As-Built Plan as "Exclusive Use Areas"; spaces so designated shall be the number of Designated Stalls for which the Purchaser shall contribute to the annual Parking Facility Operations and Maintenance cost, pursuant to Section 6. Purchaser shall have the right to directly implement changes to the Access Limiting Measures approved by the City, or, if undertaken by the City, the Purchaser shall reimburse City within thirty (30) days of demand (and not as part of Maintenance and Operating Expenses) (i) the cost of all additional or changed Access Limiting Measures required by Purchaser, and (ii) the costs of reconfiguring the Access Limiting Measures from time to time to accommodate changes in the location or extent of the Exclusive Use Areas.

 (b) The parking right granted in Section 2(ii) with respect to the Additional Stalls shall be non-exclusive, in the sense that no particular stalls in the Parking Facility shall be designated or reserved for Benefited Parkers, but shall be available, in the sense that the City shall take reasonable actions to assure that not less than the then rented number of Additional Stalls are available to Benefited Parkers during the Designated Hours. Such actions may include, but not be limited to, monitoring, throughout each day, usage of the Parking Facility by Benefited Parkers and others. To permit such monitoring, the City shall have the right to require Benefited Parkers to display stickers or tags identifying their vehicles, to use key cards or other forms of entry to the Parking Facility, and otherwise to cooperate with the City in such monitoring.

 6. Payment for Parking Rights: In consideration of the rights granted hereunder, Purchaser agrees to pay the City:

 (a) For Additional Stalls: The Purchaser shall pay the City's published 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monthly Parking Rate for Groups ("Published Rate") as also applies to the Seattle Center 1st Avenue North Garage. This rate as of November 2004 is $65 per stall per month. At the Commencement Date, the applicable rate will be the then Published Rate or $100, whichever is less, which rate shall be effective until the next annual adjustment to the Published Rate. City agrees that in no event will it adjust the Published Rate any more frequently than annually.

 (b) For Designated Stalls: The Purchaser shall pay, effective as of the Commencement Date, fifty-nine percent (59%) of $565 (in 2007) per year ("Basic O&M Rate") per Designated Stall for Basic Maintenance and Operating Services ("Basic Services"), all as defined in Exhibit E, payable in four equal quarterly installments in advance.

 (i) For the five years (or partial years based on the calendar year), following the Commencement Date, the Basic O&M Rate shall escalate annually effective on January 1st , by the higher of 3 percent (3%) or the annual change in the Seattle Area Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U).

 (ii) Prior to commencement of the 6th year and each five year period thereafter, the Purchaser and the City shall reset the Basic O&M Rate and Basic Services to reflect the then agreed common services and costs. Once the Basic O&M Rate is reset through this process, the new rate ("Updated O&M Rate") shall escalate as provided in Section 5(i). The parties agree that any Updated O&M Rates shall be calculated using the same guidelines and practices used to establish the Basic O&M Rate, as reflected in the attached Exhibit E.

 c. For Services in Excess of Basic Services: The Purchaser shall have the right from time to time to propose, via the Parking Management Committee, that the City perform Operating and Maintenance Services in addition to the Basic Services ("Added O&M Services"), provide additional fixtures or equipment, or undertake capital improvements, for which the Purchaser would bear the full marginal cost. The City shall have the right to approve such Added O&M Services, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the City shall apprise the Purchaser of the City's cost for such Added O&M Services. The Purchaser shall have thirty (30) days to agree to the additional cost prior to the City implementing the Added O&M Services. To the extent feasible, in the City's sole determination, approved and agreed Added O&M Services shall be implemented by the City as soon as practicable following Purchaser's agreement to pay the added cost.

 d. Major Maintenance Assessment: The City shall have the right to assess a proportionate share of costs of any major maintenance undertaken by the City, to the Purchaser, provided that the City shall have reviewed the need for and cost of the major maintenance work with the Parking Management Committee, as defined in Section 16. For purposes of this paragraph, Purchaser's "proportionate share of costs" shall be determined based upon the percentage that the Designated Stalls represents in comparison to the total number of stalls, unless the maintenance item relates exclusively to Purchaser's use of the Parking Facility.

 7. Term. The parking rights granted in Section 1 and 2 hereof shall be exercisable during the term commencing on the date of substantial completion of the Parking Facility as to the Designated Stalls and the date that the first of the Benefited Buildings is opened for business for the Additional Stalls (the "Commencement Date"), and continuing for so long as any of the Benefited Buildings remains in existence, unless earlier terminated by Purchaser by not less than one year's prior written notice to the City; provided however this Agreement may also be terminated by Purchaser following the termination of the Ground Lease (Garage).

 8. Operations. Provided that there is no reduction in the number of parking stalls available for Benefited Parkers, the City reserves the right to assign specific parking spaces, and to reserve parking spaces for small cars and/or oversized vehicles or disabled parkers in the Parking Facility structure; if the Parking Facility, as ultimately designed by Purchaser, includes a surface parking area, the City reserves the right to use portions of the surface parking area, as needed, for buses and commercial event trucks parking if space is available. Purchaser acknowledges that the City may, in its sole discretion, but after consultation with the Committee, as defined in Section 16 of this Agreement, retain an independent parking operator to operate and manage the Parking Facility on its behalf, in either case subject to the rights of Purchaser hereunder. City and/or its independent parking operator also reserve the right to close portions of the Parking Facility (i) in order to make repairs or perform services, or to alter, modify, restripe or renovate the Parking Facility, or (ii) if required by casualty, strike, condemnation, acts of God, requirements of law or any other reason beyond City's reasonable control. City will use its best efforts to schedule repair and maintenance work during evenings and "off" hours. Except in the case of emergency repairs or repairs and maintenance that will not interfere with Purchaser's use of parking spaces under this Parking Agreement, City shall give Purchaser not less than one (1) month's prior written notice of any repair and maintenance.

 9. Parking Facility Rules. Purchaser, City and their respective employees, members and invitees shall at all times comply with all applicable ordinances, rules, regulations, codes, laws, statutes and requirements of all federal, state, county and municipal governmental bodies or their subdivisions respecting the use of the Parking Facility. City and/or its independent parking operator reserves the right to adopt, modify and enforce reasonable rules (the "Parking Facility Rules") governing the use of the Parking Facility from time to time, including any access card, sticker or other identification or entrance system so long as such system does not restrict access to the Parking Facility or the Exclusive Use Areas by Benefited Parkers during the Designated Hours or reduce the number of parking stalls available to Benefited Parkers below the number of Designated Stalls and Additional Stalls required hereunder. Purchaser acknowledges that the City or its independent parking operator may refuse to permit any person who violates the Parking Facility Rules to park in the Parking Facility and any serious or repeated violation of the current Parking Facility Rules may result in the removal of the vehicle belonging to such a person from the Parking Facility. Purchaser shall make available current copies of the Parking Facility Rules to occupants of the Benefited Buildings and their respective employees and invitees who use the Parking Facility periodically, and upon any change or modification thereof.

 10. Maintenance of Parking Facility. The City shall maintain, or cause its independent parking operator to maintain, the Parking Facility in good condition and appearance, and in compliance with the Basic Services set forth in Exhibit E attached hereto and any Added O&M Services that may be agreed to between the parties.

 11. Staffing and Security. The City or its independent parking operator shall provide for the safe and efficient operation of the Parking Facility by providing the Basic Services in Exhibit E.

 TEMPORARY GROUND LEASE (SURFACE PARKING)

 TEMPORARY GROUND LEASE (SURFACE PARKING) (this "Lease") made and entered into this_____ day of ____________, 200_, ("Commencement Date") by and between IRIS Holdings, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Landlord"), and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation ("Tenant").

 RECITALS

 A. Landlord has on today's date acquired from Tenant the Property in King County, Washington, more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Property").

 B. The Property has been used largely for surface parking operated by Tenant, in part to meet the parking requirements of the Tenant's Seattle Center operations.

 C. Landlord intends to construct an office campus on a portion of the Property. Construction of the office campus will displace the surface parking now serving the Seattle Center, creating a need for replacement parking serving the Seattle Center. To meet this need, and to allow for certain parking to serve the office campus during the Seattle Center's off-peak hours, the parties have agreed, as a condition of Tenant's sale of the Property to Landlord, pursuant to a Parking Development Agreement between Landlord and Tenant dated ________, 200_ (the "Development Agreement") that Landlord will construct a parking garage (the "Parking Facility") on a portion of the Property (the "Garage Parcel") described in Exhibit B attached hereto.

 D. Upon the completion of the Parking Facility, the Parking Facility will be conveyed to Tenant, and the Garage Parcel will be leased to Tenant pursuant to a Ground Lease (Garage) to be entered into between Landlord and Tenant (the "Ground Lease (Garage)").

 E. The parties have agreed that it is necessary for the existing surface parking use to continue on a temporary basis prior to the completion of the Parking Facility, to support the parking requirements of the Seattle Center.

 F. Landlord has agreed to lease the Property, except as may be required for construction and construction staging for the Parking Facility, to Tenant to allow Tenant to continue its surface parking operations on a temporary basis on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 AGREEMENTS

 NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed between Landlord and Tenant:

 1. Lease. In consideration of Tenant's covenants to pay the rent and other sums provided for herein and to perform its other obligations hereunder, Landlord hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord, the Property (the "Leased Property"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right to use the Garage Parcel for construction of the Parking Facility and the area (the "Staging Area") on the Leased Property as shown on Exhibit C hereto as a staging area for its construction of the Parking Facility, provided, however, that in no event shall less than 710 spaces be available for Tenant's use (and Tenant has verified that there are currently approximately 828 parking stalls existing north of vacated Republican Street), and provided further, that Landlord's use of the staging areas will commence upon five (5) business days notice to the Tenant.

 2. Term. The Term of this Lease shall commence as of the date hereof (the "Commencement Date"), and shall expire on the first to occur of (i) the opening of the Parking Facility to the general public for parking, or (ii) any date on which Tenant has ceased to use substantially all of the Leased Property (other than the Staging Area) as a surface parking lot (provided that the temporary suspension of parking operations on the Leased Property for purposes of repairs for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days shall not be deemed a cessation of use as a parking lot). The term "Lease Year" as used herein shall mean the successive twelve month periods commencing on the Commencement Date and each anniversary thereof.

 3. Rent. Tenant covenants and agrees to pay Landlord an annual rent ("Rent") for the Leased Property of One and No/100 Dollars ($1.00), payable annually in advance on the Commencement Date and each anniversary thereof during the Term.

 4. Use. The Leased Property is leased to Tenant primarily for the purpose of operating a surface parking lot. Tenant shall not use the Leased Property for any non-Seattle Center purpose without the Landlord's prior written consent. In no event shall the use of the surface parking lot interfere with the construction or staging for construction of the Parking Facility. The Landlord shall ensure that access to the surface parking lot shall be available and construction or staging for the Parking Facility will not interfere with such access.

 5. Compliance with Laws. Tenant covenants that, at no cost or expense to Landlord, it will use and occupy the Leased Property during the Term of this Lease in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and requirements of all federal, state and municipal governments having jurisdiction, and that, in the event any use of the Leased Property shall constitute a violation of any such laws, ordinances, regulations or requirements, Tenant shall take all steps, promptly upon knowledge of such violation, reasonably necessary to remedy the same. Tenant shall secure at its sole cost all permits, licenses, permissions, consents and approvals required to be obtained from governmental agencies or third parties in connection with the operation of the Leased Property or the making of any repairs or replacements to the Leased Property or equipment thereon, as required by applicable laws, ordinances or regulations. Tenant shall cause all work on the Leased Property during the Term to be performed in accordance with all applicable laws and all directions and regulations of all governmental agencies and the representatives of such agencies having jurisdiction.

 6. Contests. Tenant shall have the right, after prior written notice to Landlord, to contest by appropriate legal proceedings diligently conducted in good faith, in the name of Tenant or Landlord or both, without cost or expense to Landlord, the validity or application of any law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement of the nature referred to in Section 5 hereof, subject to the following:

 (a) If by the terms of any such law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement, compliance therewith pending the prosecution of any such proceeding may legally be delayed without the incurrence of any lien, charge or liability of any kind against the Leased Property or any part thereof and without subjecting Tenant or Landlord to any liability, civil or criminal, for failure so to comply therewith, Tenant may delay compliance therewith until the final determination of such proceeding; or

 (b) If any lien, charge or civil liability would be incurred by reason of any such delay, Tenant nevertheless may contest as aforesaid, but may not delay in compliance with such law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement.

 Landlord, without cost to it, shall, subject to the foregoing, execute and deliver any appropriate documents which may be necessary or proper to permit Tenant so to contest the validity or application of any such law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement.

 7. Compliance with Insurance Requirements. Tenant covenants that it will observe and comply with the requirements of all policies of public liability insurance required to be maintained by Tenant at any time in force with respect to the Leased Property.

 8. Maintenance and Repairs. Tenant at its expense will keep the Leased Property in good and clean order and condition, and will promptly make all necessary or appropriate repairs and replacements to the Leased Property, and to any equipment used by Tenant thereon, necessary to permit Tenant to continue its parking operations on the Leased Property.

 9. Utilities. Tenant shall pay or cause to be paid when due, and shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Landlord and the Property from, any and all charges for public or private utility services to or for the Leased Property during the Term, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all charges for light, electricity, water, gas, telephone service, garbage collection and sewage service, except as such services are for the purpose of construction of the Parking Facility. Landlord shall have no liability whatsoever for the failure of any such service for any reason except if such failure is due to the activities of the Landlord in development of the Property.

 10. Permitted Contests. Tenant at its sole cost and expense may, after prior written notice to Landlord, by appropriate legal proceedings conducted in good faith and with due diligence, contest the amount or validity or application, in whole or in part, of any Imposition or lien therefor, or any other lien, encumbrance or charge against the Leased Property arising from work done or materials provided to or for Tenant, if, and only if:

 (a) Neither the Leased Property nor any part thereof or interest therein is or will be in any danger of being sold, forfeited or lost; and

 (b) Such delay would not subject Landlord to criminal liability or fine.

 Tenant shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Landlord and the Leased Property from any lien or liability with respect to any such Imposition or contest thereof, including all costs and expenses related thereto.

 12. Alterations and Additions Tenant shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the Term, so long as no default exists hereunder, to make, at its expense, changes, renovations, alterations and additions to the Leased Property or any part thereof (an "Alteration"); provided, however, that any such Alteration:

 (a) shall not change the use of the Leased Property;

 (b) shall be effected with due diligence in good and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with all legal requirements and insurance requirements;

 (c) shall be promptly and fully paid for by Tenant; and

 (d) shall either be removed by Tenant upon the expiration of the Term as provided in Section 13 or, if Tenant does not wish to so remove such Alteration, shall be subject to the prior written approval of Landlord, provided that Landlord shall approve any such Alteration provided that it (i) is made in compliance with subsections (a) through (c) above, and (ii) will not materially increase the cost to Landlord of preparing the site for construction of the proposed office campus.

 13. Surrender Upon Termination. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove Tenant's personal property and equipment and any Alteration not approved by Landlord pursuant to Section 12(d), and shall surrender the Leased Property to Landlord. Tenant's personal property and equipment not removed by Tenant at expiration or other termination shall be considered abandoned and Landlord may dispose of such property in accordance with the law governing abandoned property in effect at the time of abandonment.

 14. Discharge of Liens. Tenant will not directly or indirectly create or permit to be created or to remain, and will discharge any mortgage, lien, security interest, encumbrance or charge on, pledge of or conditional sale or other title retention agreement with respect to the Property or any part thereof, or with respect to Rent, or any other sums payable under this Lease, other than (a) this Lease; (b) liens for Impositions not yet payable, or payable without the addition of any fine, penalty interest or cost for nonpayment, or being contested as permitted by Section 11.

 15. Damage or Destruction. In the event of damage to or destruction of any improvements on the Leased Property, Tenant shall, at its option, either (i) repair and restore the improvements so damaged or destroyed to a condition permitting the continued use of the Leased Property as a surface parking lot, or (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 2 hereof, elect not to so repair and restore such improvements, provided that if Tenant elects not to repair and restore such improvements. Tenant shall remove any such damaged improvements or take such actions with respect to such damaged improvements as are necessary to avoid any danger to the safety of persons coming on to the Property.

 16. Insurance. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, continuously maintain during the Term, a liability self-insurance program generally equivalent to a commercial general liability insurance policy covering claims with respect to injuries or damages to persons or property sustained in, on or about the Leased Property and the appurtenances thereto, with a limit of liability of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) each occurrence; however, Landlord understands and agrees that it is not an additional insured under such liability self-insurance program. Promptly upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall provide to Landlord a self-insurance letter evidencing such coverage. Such liability self-insurance program shall not be materially changed or cancelled with respect to Landlord except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice from Tenant to Landlord.

 17. Condemnation. In the event of the taking or condemnation by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose of the whole of the Leased Property, or of materially all of the Leased Property (as defined below) at any time during the Term, the Term shall cease as of the date of the taking by the condemnor and all rental and other payments shall be apportioned as of such date. For the purposes of this Section, a taking or condemnation of materially all of the Leased Property means a taking of such scope that the remaining part of the Leased Property not taken cannot be adequately restored, repaired or reconstructed so as to constitute a complete and functional surface parking lot. In the event of a taking of less than all or materially all of the Leased Property, this Lease shall terminate as to the portion of the Leased Property taken, but shall continue as to the remaining portion of the Leased Property not taken, so long as Tenant continues parking operations on the portion of the Leased Property not taken, and Rent shall be abated in proportion to the area of the Leased Property taken. All proceeds of any taking of the Leased Property shall be the sole property of Landlord.

 18. Inspection of Premises. Landlord and Landlord's agents and representatives shall be entitled, from time to time, upon reasonable notice to Tenant, to go upon the Leased Property during normal business hours for the purpose of inspecting the Leased Property or the performance by Tenant of the agreements and conditions of this Lease.

 19. Tenant to Indemnify Landlord. Notwithstanding that joint or concurrent liability may be imposed upon Landlord by statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or order, Tenant shall upon demand indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse Landlord from and against and for any and all liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, suits, claims, demands, actions, costs and expenses of any kind or nature including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees which may be imposed upon or asserted against Landlord by reason of the occurrence of any one or more of the following, or of facts or events which result in any one or more of the following:

 (a) Any breach, violation or non-performance of any covenant or agreement in this Lease set forth and contained on the part of the Tenant to be fulfilled, kept, observed or performed;

 (b) Any accident, injury or damage to person and/or property (except to the extent arising from the non-performance or negligent performance of any covenant or obligation undertaken by Landlord under this Lease), arising from any use or occupancy of the Leased Property which Tenant may make, permit or suffer to be made or exist, or occasioned by any use, occupancy of, or activity on the Leased Property, or any part thereof, by or for Tenant (or any subtenant, invitee, contractor, employee or agent of Tenant or of any subtenant);

 (c) Any negligence or any wrongful act or omission on the part of Tenant or its subtenants or any of their agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, subtenants or invitees, or anyone claiming through the foregoing; or

 (d) Any work or thing done by or for Tenant in, on or about the Leased Property, or any part thereof unless performed by Landlord or its agents.

 If Tenant is required to defend any action or proceeding pursuant to this Section to which action or proceeding Landlord is made a party, Landlord shall also be entitled to appear, defend, or otherwise take part in the matter involved, at its election, by counsel of its own choosing, and to the extent Landlord is indemnified under this Section 19, Tenant shall bear the reasonable costs of Landlord's defense, including attorneys fees.

 20. Assignment and Subletting. Tenant may not assign this Lease, or any interest therein, nor sublet the Leased Property or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of Landlord. Tenant may contract with a third party operator of the parking operations on the Leased Property, but no such contract shall relieve Tenant of its liability for the performance of all obligations of the Tenant hereunder.

 21. Event of Default The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:

 21.1. Payments to Landlord. Failure of Tenant to duly and punctually make any payment owing to Landlord hereunder, or (subject to the provisions of Section 11) to pay any Imposition or any other payment which if not paid may result in a lien on the Leased Property as and when the same becomes due and payable, or the failure to maintain any of the insurance coverage required hereunder or pay any of the premiums required to be paid with respect thereto, and such occurrence or failure continues for a period of ten (10) business days after notice thereof given to Tenant by Landlord.

 21.2 Other Covenants. Tenant being in breach of, or Tenant failing to perform, comply with, or observe any other term, covenant, warranty, condition, agreement or undertaking contained in or arising under this Lease other than those referred to in Section 21.1 and such occurrence or failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days after notice thereof is given to Tenant.

 22. Termination of Lease. In addition to all other rights and remedies available to Landlord by law or equity, Landlord may, at any time after the occurrence of any Event of Default, and while the same remains unremedied, give notice to Tenant of its intention to terminate this Lease, in which case, unless within ten (10) business days after the giving of such notice, the condition creating or upon which is based such an Event of Default is cured, this Lease shall terminate as of the expiration of such ten (10) business days and Landlord may reenter upon the Leased Property and have possession thereof; provided, however, if the Event of Default is one described in Section 21.2 and is one which can be cured, but cannot with due diligence (without regard to the availability of funds or the financial condition of Tenant) be cured prior to the expiration of the period provided herein, and Tenant proceeds promptly and thereafter prosecutes with all due diligence the curing of such default, then the time for curing of such Event of Default shall be extended for such period as may be necessary to complete the same with all due diligence.

 23. Damages and Remedies. The exercise by Landlord of any remedy arising by virtue of an Event of Default shall not be considered exclusive, and Landlord may exercise any and all other rights or remedies provided by this Lease or by law or equity. The termination of the Term pursuant to Section 22 shall not extinguish the right of either party to collect damages arising from the breach of this Lease by the other party. Tenant shall be liable for rentals accruing up to the end of the Term specified in this Lease notwithstanding the early termination of such Term due to an Event of Default and the reentry of Landlord before the normal expiration of the Term as established herein or pursuant hereto, and Tenant shall pay such current damages to Landlord on the days on which such rental would have been payable hereunder if no such termination and repossession and reentry had occurred.

 24. No Waivers. No failure by any party hereto to insist upon the strict performance of any provision of this Lease or to exercise any right, power or remedy consequent to any breach thereof, and no waiver of any such breach, or the acceptance of full or partial rent during the continuance thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such provision. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Lease, which shall continue in full force and effect, or the rights of any party hereto with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach.

 25. Payment by Landlord of Tenant's Defaulted Payments. In case of default on the part of Tenant to pay any money, or do any act to satisfy any of the obligations or covenants which it is required to pay, do, or satisfy under the provisions of this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, after notice to Tenant, pay any or all such sums, or do any or all such acts which require the payment of money, or incur any expense whatsoever to remedy the failure of Tenant to perform any one or more of the covenants herein contained. Tenant shall repay the same to Landlord on demand together with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, such interest to be calculated from the date payment is made by Landlord.

 26. No Partnership. Nothing contained herein or in any instrument relating hereto shall be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture between Landlord and Tenant or between Landlord and any other party, or cause Landlord to be responsible in any way for debts or obligations of Tenant or any other party. All revenues generated by Tenant's parking operations on the Leased Property shall belong solely to Tenant.

 27. Time of the Essence. Time is hereby expressly declared to be of the essence of this Lease and of each and every term, covenant, agreement, condition and provision hereof.

 28. Captions. The captions of this Lease are for convenience and reference only, and are not a part of this Lease, and in no way amplify, define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Lease, nor in any way affect this Lease.

 29. Meaning of Terms. Words of any gender in this Lease shall be held to include any other gender and words in the singular number shall be held to include the plural when the sense requires. Any reference in this Lease to a number of "days" shall be deemed to refer to calendar days unless "business days" are specified.

 30. Lease Construed as a Whole. The language in all parts of this Lease shall in all cases be construed as a whole according to its fair meaning and neither strictly for nor against Landlord or Tenant.

 31. Severability. If any provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this Lease shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that if any provision of this Lease relating to the payment of rents is to any extent found invalid or unenforceable, Landlord and Tenant agree to modify this Lease to provide for payment of rents comparable to the rents provided for herein.

 32. Effect of Assignment. The term "Landlord" means the person who from time to time holds all of the original Landlord's right, title and interest in and to the Leased Property. Landlord shall have the right to freely assign or, otherwise transfer such right, title and interest and upon notice of such transfer given by the Landlord to the Tenant, the Landlord shall be entirely freed and relieved of all future covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder except to the extent that the transfer is for purposes of security only; provided that the release shall be effective only upon the assignee or transferee having expressly assumed, by duly recorded documents, all obligations of Landlord hereunder.

 33. Survival. Each provision of this Lease which may require the payment of money by, to or on behalf of Landlord or Tenant or third parties after the expiration of the Term hereof or its earlier termination shall survive such expiration or earlier termination.

 34. Memorandum of Lease. The parties agree to execute and acknowledge an appropriate memorandum of this Lease for public recordation purposes.

 GROUND LEASE (GARAGE)

 GROUND LEASE (GARAGE) (this "Lease") made and entered into this_____ day of ____________, 200_, ("Commencement Date") by and between IRIS Holdings, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Landlord"), and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation, ("Tenant").

 RECITALS

 A. Landlord acquired from Tenant the Property in King County, Washington, more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto ("the Property").

 B. The Property had been used largely for surface parking operated by Tenant, in part to meet the parking requirements of the Tenant's Seattle Center operations.

 C. Landlord intends to construct an office campus on a portion of the Property. Construction of the office campus will displace the surface parking now serving the Seattle Center, creating a need for replacement parking serving the Seattle Center. To meet this need, and to allow for certain parking to serve the office campus during the Seattle Center's off-peak hours, the parties agreed, as a condition of Tenant's sale of the Property to Landlord and as part of the consideration therefore, that Landlord would construct, pursuant to a Parking Facility Development Agreement between Landlord and Tenant dated ________, 200_ (the "Development Agreement") a parking garage (the "Parking Facility") on a portion of the Property (the "Garage Parcel") as identified on the attached Exhibit B. The total cost incurred by Landlord to construct the Parking Facility ("Total Development Cost") was ______________ Dollars ($_______________).

 D. The sale price of the Property reflects restrictions on the use of the Garage Parcel and accordingly was discounted.

 E. Landlord has completed construction of the Parking Facility, and, as contemplated by the Development Agreement, has conveyed the Parking Facility to Tenant, and will now lease the Leased Property, as defined below, to Tenant, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease.

 F. Pursuant to a Parking Operating Agreement of even date herewith (the "Operating Agreement"), Tenant has granted to Landlord, for the benefit of occupants of the office campus, certain parking rights in the Parking Facility.

 AGREEMENTS

 NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed between Landlord and Tenant:

 1. Lease. In consideration of Tenant's covenants to pay the rent and other sums provided for herein and to perform its other obligations hereunder, Landlord hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord, the portion of the Garage Parcel that is ultimately occupied by the Parking Facility, but reserving unto Landlord the ground and air rights below and above the Parking Facility as constructed (the "Leased Property"). Tenant is familiar with and has inspected the Leased Property and the Parking Facility and accepts the same on the Commencement Date in their present condition.

 2. Term. The Term of this Lease shall commence as of the date hereof (the "Commencement Date"), and shall expire, subject to earlier termination as provided herein, on the first to occur of (i) the opening to the general public of a new parking facility, with approximately 710 parking stalls, owned or operated by the City, which is located within 1000 feet of 5th Avenue North between Mercer Street and Denny Street and serving in part the parking requirements of Tenant's Seattle Center operations, (ii) the determination by Tenant, effective upon not less than one year's written notice to Landlord, that the Parking Facility is no longer needed for Tenant's Seattle Center operations, or (iii) the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the Commencement Date, unless the Term is extended as provided herein. The term "Lease Year" as used herein shall mean the successive twelve month periods commencing on the Commencement Date and each anniversary thereof. With respect to subpart (i) above, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that if it undertakes to build a new parking facility within that specified area, it will use its best efforts to build a parking facility with at least 710 parking stalls.

 Tenant shall have the right to extend the Term of this Lease for one additional period of fifteen (15) years (the "Extended Term"), provided that the Landlord is given written notice of Tenant's intent to exercise the option at least one year prior to the expiration of the initial term. For any such extended period, the annual Rent shall be the fair market value as determined by an appraiser selected by the parties of the Leased Property as a garage site. Within fifteen (15) days following receipt of written notice from the Tenant that it intends to exercise its right to the Extended Term, (the "Appraisal Date"), Tenant and Landlord shall retain a mutually agreed upon M.A.I. Appraiser to determine the fair market rental value of the Leased Property, as improved, and provide an appraisal. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the Tenant. The appraiser thus selected shall proceed to appraise the Leased Property, as improved, to determine the fair market rental value and provide an appraisal within sixty (60) days of the Appraisal Date. If Tenant and Landlord cannot agree upon an M.A.I Appraiser within fifteen (15) days as provided above then each party shall obtain a separate appraisal performed by an MAI appraiser, the cost of which shall be paid by each party to its separately contracted appraiser and shall be obtained within sixty (60) days of the Appraisal Date. If the conclusions of the two appraisers do not vary by in excess of 10%, then the fair market rental value shall be the average of the two conclusions. If the conclusions vary by more than 10% from the higher valuation, then the two appraisers shall join to appoint a third appraiser within 75 days of the Appraisal Date. Such third appraiser shall then individually determine the fair market rental value within 120 days of the Appraisal Date. Such determination shall be binding upon each of the parties, provided that in the event such third appraiser's determination is higher than the previous high, said previous high shall be the fair market rental value, or in the event such third appraiser's determination is lower than the previous low, said previous low shall be the fair market rental value. The cost of the third appraiser, if any, shall be shared equally between the parties.

 If this Lease is terminated pursuant to subsection (i) or (ii) above, Landlord shall pay to Tenant, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such termination, an amount equal to $15,750,000, plus the amount of any change orders for capital improvements paid by the City in accordance with Section 4.3.1.3 of the Parking Facility Development Agreement, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of years from the date of such termination to the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the Commencement Date, and the denominator of which is fifty (50).

 Upon the termination or expiration of this Lease, all improvements to the Garage parcel, including the Parking Facility shall become the property of Landlord and Tenant agrees to quit claim any such improvements to Landlord, provided that the deed will include a restriction that so long as the Parking Facility is owned by Landlord or an entity affiliated with or owned or controlled by Landlord, the Parking Facility may be used only for the parking serving the Property and not as general public parking, but such restriction shall be of no further force or effect in the event that Landlord transfers and conveys the Parking Facility to an non-affiliated third party.

 3. Rent. Tenant covenants and agrees to pay Landlord an annual rent ("Rent") for the Leased Property of ONE and No/100 Dollars ($1.00) during the initial Term, payable annually in advance on the Commencement Date and each anniversary thereof during the Term. The Rent during the Extended Term shall be paid in advance on a monthly basis, with each payment being due and payable on the first day of the given month and any late payment of Rent shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum until paid.

 4. Use. The Leased Property is leased to Tenant primarily for the purpose of owning and operating the Parking Facility as a parking facility open to the general public, subject to the provisions of the Operating Agreement. Tenant may use the Leased Property for other occasional, temporary Seattle Center purposes without the Landlord's prior written consent; provided, in no event shall any Seattle Center non-parking purpose interfere with Landlord's use rights as set forth in the Operating Agreement. Tenant shall provide Landlord with reasonable prior written notice of any intended non-parking Seattle Center uses.

 5. Compliance with Laws. Tenant covenants that, at no cost or expense to Landlord, it will use and occupy the Leased Property during the Term of this Lease in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and requirements of all federal, state and municipal governments having jurisdiction, and that, in the event any use of the Leased Property shall constitute a violation of any such laws, ordinances, regulations or requirements, Tenant shall take all steps, promptly upon knowledge of such violation, reasonably necessary to remedy the same. Tenant shall secure at its sole cost all permits, licenses, permissions, consents and approvals required to be obtained from governmental agencies or third parties in connection with the operation of the Leased Property or the making of any repairs or replacements to the Leased Property or equipment thereon, as required by applicable laws, ordinances or regulations. Tenant shall cause all work on the Leased Property during the Term to be performed in accordance with all applicable laws and all directions and regulations of all governmental agencies and the representatives of such agencies having jurisdiction.

 6. Contests. Tenant shall have the right, after prior written notice to Landlord, to contest by appropriate legal proceedings diligently conducted in good faith, in the name of Tenant or Landlord or both, without cost or expense to Landlord, the validity or application of any law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement of the nature referred to in Section 5 hereof, subject to the following:

 (a) If by the terms of any such law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement, compliance therewith pending the prosecution of any such proceeding may legally be delayed without the incurrence of any lien, charge or liability of any kind against the Leased Property or any part thereof and without subjecting Tenant or Landlord to any liability, civil or criminal, for failure so to comply therewith, Tenant may delay compliance therewith until the final determination of such proceeding; or

 (b) If any lien, charge or civil liability would be incurred by reason of any such delay, Tenant nevertheless may contest as aforesaid, but may not delay in compliance with such law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement.

 Landlord, without cost to it, shall, subject to the foregoing, execute and deliver any appropriate documents which may be necessary or proper to permit Tenant so to contest the validity or application of any such law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement.

 7. Compliance with Insurance Requirements. Tenant covenants that it will observe and comply with the requirements of all policies of insurance required to be maintained by Tenant with respect to the Leased Property.

 8. Maintenance and Repairs. Tenant at its expense (subject to the provisions of the Operating Agreement with respect to the payment of Operating Expenses) will keep the Leased Property in good and clean order and condition, and will promptly make all necessary or appropriate repairs and replacements to the Leased Property, and to any equipment therein, whether interior or exterior, structural or nonstructural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, necessary to permit Tenant to continue parking operations on the Leased Property. All repairs, replacements and renewals shall be substantially equal or superior in quality and class to the original work.

 9. Utilities. Tenant shall pay or cause to be paid when due, and shall (subject to the provisions of the Operating Agreement with respect to payment of Operating Expenses) indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Landlord and the Property from any and all charges for public or private utility services to or for the Leased Property during the Term, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all charges for light, electricity, water, gas, telephone service, garbage collection and sewage service. Landlord shall have no liability whatsoever for the failure of any such service for any reason.

 10. Impositions. Tenant at its expense (subject to the provisions of the Operating Agreement with respect to payment of Operating Expenses) shall pay when due and before any interest, penalty, fine or cost which may be added for nonpayment, each and every one of the following ("Impositions"):

 (a) All taxes imposed on or with respect to personal property and intangibles located in or used in connection with the Leased Property; and

 (b) Tenant's pro rata share of all assessments for public improvements or benefits including but not limited to all road improvement district and utility local improvement district taxes which are assessed during the Term of this Lease, and any similar assessments and charges. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon Tenant's pro rata share, than such dispute shall be submitted to the dispute resolution provisions contained in Section 41 of this Lease.

 If by law any Imposition may at the option of the taxpayer be paid in installments, Tenant may exercise such option, and shall pay all such installments (and interest, if any) becoming due during the Term as the same become due and before any additional interest or any penalty, fine or cost may be added thereto, and shall at the end of the Term deposit with Landlord an amount sufficient to pay Tenant's pro rata share of all Impositions for the Lease Year in which this Lease terminates. Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord, as requested, in connection with any real property tax assessment of the Garage Parcel and the Parking Facility.

 11. Permitted Contests. Tenant at its sole cost and expense may, after prior written notice to Landlord, by appropriate legal proceedings conducted in good faith and with due diligence, contest the amount or validity or application, in whole or in part, of any Imposition or lien therefore, or any other lien, encumbrance or charge against the Leased Property arising from work done or materials provided to or for Tenant, if, and only if:

 (a) Neither the Leased Property nor any part thereof or interest therein is or will be in any danger of being sold, forfeited or lost; and

 (b) Such delay would not subject Landlord to criminal liability or fine;

 Tenant shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Landlord and the Leased Property from any lien or liability with respect to any such Imposition or contest thereof, including all costs and expenses related thereto.

 12. Ownership of Improvements. During the Term of this Lease, the Parking Facility, including without limitation all additions, alterations and improvements thereto or replacements thereof and all appurtenant fixtures, machinery and equipment installed therein, shall be the property of Tenant. At the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease,(i) the Parking Facility and all additions, alterations and improvements thereto or replacements thereof and all appurtenant fixtures, machinery and equipment installed therein, other than Tenant's personal property, shall become the property of Landlord, and (ii) Tenant shall remove Tenant's personal property. Tenant's personal property not removed by Tenant at expiration or other termination of the Term shall be considered abandoned and Landlord may dispose of such property in accordance with the law governing abandoned property in effect at the time of abandonment.

 13. Alterations and Additions Tenant shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the Term, so long as no default exists hereunder, to make, at its expense, changes, renovations, alterations and additions to the Leased Property or any part thereof; provided, however, that any such change, renovation alteration or addition:

 (a) shall not change the use of the Leased Property, or reduce the fair market value of the Parking Facility;

 (b) shall be effected with due diligence in good and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with all legal requirements and insurance requirements; and

 (c) shall be promptly and fully paid for by Tenant;

Tenant will not directly or indirectly create or permit to be created or to remain, and will discharge any mortgage, lien, security interest, encumbrance or charge on, pledge of or conditional sale or other title retention agreement with respect to the Property or any part thereof, or with respect to Rent, or any other sums payable under this Lease, other than (a) this Lease; (b) liens for Impositions not yet payable, or payable without the addition of any fine, penalty interest or cost for nonpayment, or being contested as permitted by Section 11.

 15. Insurance. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, continuously maintain during the Term, (i) a liability self-insurance program generally equivalent to a commercial general liability insurance policy covering claims with respect to injuries or damages to persons or property sustained in, on or about the Leased Property and the appurtenances thereto, with a limit of liability of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) each occurrence; however, Landlord understands and agrees that it is not an additional insured under such liability self-insurance program, and (ii) all risk physical damage insurance covering the Parking Facility, in an amount equal to the current replacement value of the Parking Facility as Landlord shall stipulate in writing to Tenant on an annual basis; such property insurance shall include Landlord as an additional named insured and loss payee with a mortgagee clause and shall provide for a waiver of subrogation and waiver of rights of recovery in favor of Landlord, provided, however, that the waiver of rights of recovery shall not apply to any loss (including liability self-insurance loss) that the City may sustain falling within the scope of Article 7.5 ("Indemnification") of the PARKING FACILITY DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN IRIS, LLC AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE dated ____________, 200_.

 As to Tenant's liability self-insurance program, promptly upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall provide to Landlord a self-insurance letter evidencing such coverage. Such liability self-insurance program shall not be materially adversely changed or cancelled with respect to Landlord except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice from Tenant to Landlord. As to property insurance, promptly upon the request of Landlord, Tenant shall cause to be provided to Landlord certificates of insurance or certified copies of policies. The property insurance described in this Section 15 shall contain a provision that such insurance may not be cancelled with respect to Landlord except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice from the insurers to Landlord, except ten (10) days prior written notice as respects cancellation for non-payment of claims, or as in accordance with RCW 48.18.290 ("Cancellation by insurer")

 16. Damage or Destruction. In the event of damage to or destruction of the Parking Facility:

 16.1 Restoration Permitted. If the Parking Facility can be repaired and restored to substantially its condition prior to such damage or destruction under then existing laws, ordinances, statutes or regulations of any governmental authorities applicable thereto (or can be so repaired or restored with changes to the former condition and form of property damaged or destroyed such that the repaired and reconstructed property has substantially the same use and the same economic value as the property had immediately prior to such damage or destruction and the Parking Facility as so repaired and restored can comply with the requirements of the Operating Agreement (the "Changed Condition" and within the available proceeds from insurance acquired pursuant to Section 15, Tenant shall effect, and Landlord and Tenant agree that the funds derived from such insurance shall be made available to effect the repair and reconstruction of the improvements so damaged or destroyed to substantially their condition prior to said damage or destruction, (or to the Changed Condition) which repair and reconstruction shall be completed by Tenant with due diligence.

 All such repair and restoration shall be carried on in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by a licensed architect or architects approved by Landlord (acting reasonably) if such an architect is reasonably required, given the scope and nature of the work. No changes in such plans and specifications which, together with all other changes theretofore made, involve over Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), shall be made without prior written consent of the Landlord.

 16.2 Restoration not Permitted. If reconstruction or rebuilding of the Parking Facility to substantially its condition prior to such damage or destruction cannot be made within available insurance proceeds and/or under then existing laws, ordinances, statutes or regulations of any governmental authority applicable thereto (and cannot be so made to the Changed Condition), then the Term shall end as of the date of such damage or destruction and the insurance proceeds payable as a result of such damage or destruction shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant as provided in Section 16.4 and the parties shall have no further obligation to the other, including any obligation under the third paragraph of Section 2 above.

 16.3 Damage During Last Ten (10) Years of Term. If damage or destruction of the Parking Facility occurs during the last ten (10) years of the Term, and the costs of repairing, restoring, replacing or rebuilding the same exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), then Tenant may elect, by written notice given to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of such damage or destruction, to terminate this Lease, and, in such event, the Term shall thereupon terminate as of the date of such notice and the insurance proceeds payable as a result of such damage or destruction shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant as provided in Section 16.4 and the parties shall have no further obligation to the other, including any obligation under the third paragraph of Section 2 above.

 16.4 Allocation of Proceeds. Insurance proceeds payable upon any termination of this Lease pursuant to Subsections 16.2 or 16.3 shall be allocated as follows: Tenant shall receive a fraction ("Tenant's Share") of such proceeds equal to the product of (i) a fraction the numerator of which is $15,750,000 and the denominator of which is the Total Development Cost, and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of years remaining from the date of such termination to the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the Commencement Date and the denominator of which is fifty (50). Landlord shall receive the balance of such insurance proceeds.

 17. Condemnation. In the event of the taking or condemnation by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose of the whole of the Leased Property, or of materially all of the Leased Property (as defined below) at any time during the Term, the Term shall cease as of the date of taking by the condemnor and all rental and other payments shall be apportioned as of the date of taking. For the purposes of this Section, a taking or condemnation of materially all of the Leased Property means a taking of such scope that the remaining part of the Leased Property not taken cannot be so repaired or restored with changes to the former condition and form of property taken such that the repaired and reconstructed property has substantially the same use and the same economic value as the property had immediately prior to such taking and the Parking Facility as so repaired and restored can comply with the requirements of the Operating Agreement (the "Changed Condition"). In the event of a taking of less than all or materially all of the Leased Property, this Lease shall terminate as to the portion of the Leased Property taken, but shall continue as to the remaining portion not so taken, and Tenant shall effect, and Landlord and Tenant agree that any condemnation proceeds shall be made available to effect, the repair and reconstruction of the remaining improvements to substantially their condition prior to such taking (or to the Changed Condition) which repair and reconstruction shall be completed by Tenant with due diligence.

 All such repair and restoration shall be carried on in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by a licensed architect or architects approved by Landlord (acting reasonably) if such an architect is reasonably required, given the scope and nature of the work. No changes in such plans and specifications which, together with all other changes theretofore made, involve over Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), shall be made without prior written notice and consultation with the Landlord.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a taking of less than all or materially all of the Leased Property during the last ten (10) years of the Term, if the costs of repairing, restoring, replacing or rebuilding the remainder of the Leased Property not so taken exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), then Tenant may elect, by written notice given to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of such taking, to terminate this Lease, and, in such event, the Term shall thereupon terminate as of the date of such notice.

 In the event of the termination of this Lease pursuant to this Section 17, or in the event this lease is not terminated but condemnation proceeds are paid in excess of the costs of the repair and reconstruction of the remaining improvements, then such condemnation proceeds, or excess condemnation proceeds, as the case may be, shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant as follows: Tenant shall receive a fraction of such proceeds equal to Tenant's Share, and Landlord shall receive the balance of such proceeds.

 18. Inspection of Premises. Landlord and Landlord's agents and representatives shall be entitled, from time to time, upon reasonable notice to Tenant, to go upon the Leased Property during normal business hours for the purpose of inspecting the Leased Property or the performance by Tenant of the agreements and conditions of this Lease.

 19. Tenant to Indemnify Landlord. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tenant shall upon demand indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse Landlord from and against and for any and all liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, suits, claims, demands, actions, costs and expenses of any kind or nature including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees which may be imposed upon or asserted against Landlord by reason of the occurrence of any one or more of the following, or of facts or events which result in any one or more of the following:

 (a) Any breach, violation or non-performance of any covenant or agreement in this Lease set forth and contained on the part of the Tenant to be fulfilled, kept, observed or performed;

 (b) Any accident, injury or damage to person and/or property (except to the extent arising from the non-performance or negligent performance of any covenant or obligation undertaken by Landlord under this Lease), arising from any use or occupancy of the Leased Property which Tenant may make, permit or suffer to be made or exist, or occasioned by any use, occupancy of, or activity on the Leased Property, or any part thereof, by or for Tenant (or any subtenant, invitee, contractor, employee or agent of Tenant or of any subtenant);

 (c) Any negligence or any wrongful act or omission on the part of Tenant or its subtenants or any of their agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, subtenants or invitees, or anyone claiming through the foregoing; or

 (d) Any work or thing done by or for Tenant in, on or about the Leased Property, or any part thereof unless performed by Landlord or its agents.

 If Tenant is required to defend any action or proceeding pursuant to this Section to which action or proceeding Landlord is made a party, Landlord shall also be entitled to appear, defend, or otherwise take part in the matter involved, at its election, by counsel of its own choosing, and to the extent Landlord is indemnified under this Section 19, Tenant shall bear the reasonable costs of Landlord's defense, including attorneys fees.

 20. Assignment and Subletting. Tenant may not assign this Lease, or any interest therein, nor sublet the Leased Property or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of Landlord. Tenant may contract with a third party operator of the parking operations on the Leased Property, but no such contract shall relieve Tenant of its liability for the performance of all obligations of the Tenant hereunder.

 21. Event of Default The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:

 21.1. Payments to Landlord. Failure of Tenant to duly and punctually make any payment owing to Landlord hereunder, or (subject to the provisions of Section 11) to pay any Imposition or any other payment which if not paid may result in a lien on the Leased Property as and when the same becomes due and payable, or the failure to maintain any of the insurance coverage required hereunder or pay any of the premiums required to be paid with respect thereto, and such occurrence or failure continues for a period of ten (10) business days after notice thereof given to Tenant by Landlord.

 21.2 Other Covenants. Tenant being in breach of, or Tenant failing to perform, comply with, or observe any other term, covenant, warranty, condition, agreement or undertaking contained in or arising under this Lease other than those referred to in Section 21.1 and such occurrence or failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days after notice thereof is given to Tenant.

 22. Termination of Lease. In addition to all other rights and remedies available to Landlord by law or equity, Landlord may, at any time after the occurrence of any Event of Default, and while the same remains unremedied, give notice to Tenant of its intention to terminate this Lease, in which case, unless within ten (10) business days after the giving of such notice, the condition creating or upon which is based such an Event of Default is cured, this Lease shall terminate as of the expiration of such ten (10) business days and Landlord may reenter upon the Leased Property and have possession thereof; provided, however, if the Event of Default is one described in Section 21.2 and is one which can be cured, but cannot with due diligence (without regard to the availability of funds or the financial condition of Tenant) be cured prior to the expiration of the period provided herein, and Tenant proceeds promptly and thereafter prosecutes with all due diligence the curing of such default, then the time for curing of such Event of Default shall be extended for such period as may be necessary to complete the same with all due diligence.

 23. Damages and Remedies. The exercise by Landlord of any remedy arising by virtue of an Event of Default shall not be considered exclusive, and Landlord may exercise any and all other rights or remedies provided by this Lease or by law or equity. The termination of the Term pursuant to Section 22 shall not extinguish the right of either party to collect damages arising from the breach of this Lease by the other party or the Tenant's other rights to repayment of its depreciated capital contribution to construction of the garage.

 24. No Waivers. No failure by any party hereto to insist upon the strict performance of any provision of this Lease or to exercise any right, power or remedy consequent to any breach thereof, and no waiver of any such breach, or the acceptance of full or partial rent during the continuance thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such provision. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Lease, which shall continue in full force and effect, or the rights of any party hereto with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach.

 25. Payment by Landlord of Tenant's Defaulted Payments. In case of default on the part of Tenant to pay any money, or do any act to satisfy any of the obligations or covenants which it is required to pay, do, or satisfy under the provisions of this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, after notice to Tenant, pay any or all such sums, or do any or all such acts which require the payment of money, or incur any expense whatsoever to remedy the failure of Tenant to perform any one or more of the covenants herein contained. Tenant shall repay the same to Landlord on demand together with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, such interest to be calculated from the date payment is made by Landlord.

 26. No Partnership. Nothing contained herein or in any instrument relating hereto shall be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture between Landlord and Tenant or between Landlord and any other party, or cause Landlord to be responsible in any way for debts or obligations of Tenant or any other party. All revenues generated by Tenant's parking operations on the Leased Property shall belong solely to Tenant.

 27. Time of the Essence. Time is hereby expressly declared to be of the essence of this Lease and of each and every term, covenant, agreement, condition and provision hereof.

 28. Captions. The captions of this Lease are for convenience and reference only, and are not a part of this Lease, and in no way amplify, define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Lease, nor in any way affect this Lease.

 30. Lease Construed as a Whole. The language in all parts of this Lease shall in all cases be construed as a whole according to its fair meaning and neither strictly for nor against Landlord or Tenant.

 31. Severability. If any provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this Lease shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that if any provision of this Lease relating to the payment of rents is to any extent found invalid or unenforceable, Landlord and Tenant agree to modify this Lease to provide for payment of rents comparable to the rents provided for herein.

 32. Effect of Assignment. The term "Landlord" means the person who from time to time holds all of the original Landlord's right, title, obligations and interest in and to the Leased Property. Landlord shall have the right to assign or, otherwise transfer such right, title and interest and upon notice of such transfer given by the assigning Landlord to the Tenant, the Landlord shall be entirely freed and relieved of all future covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder except to the extent that the transfer is for purposes of security only; provided that the release shall be effective only upon the assignee or transferee having expressly assumed, by duly recorded documents, all obligations of Landlord hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an assignment of Landlord's right, title and interest in and to the Leased Property for non-security purposes, to a non-affiliated third party, Tenant shall have the right to approve the financial ability of such assignee to perform its obligations under this Agreement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 33. Survival. Each provision of this Lease which may require the payment of money by, to or on behalf of Landlord or Tenant or third parties after the expiration of the Term hereof or its earlier termination shall survive such expiration or earlier termination.

 REMEDIATION AGREEMENT

 This REMEDIATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated ___________, 2005 (the "Effective Date") is entered into by and between IRIS Holdings, LLC, a Washington limited liability company, (the "Purchaser"), and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation, (the "City"), (collectively, the "Parties").

 RECITALS

 A. Purchaser and the City are parties to a Purchase Agreement dated _____________________________, 2005 (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the City intends to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser intends to purchase from the City approximately 12.3 acres of land in Seattle, Washington (the "Land"), as more fully described in Exhibit A attached hereto.

 B. Purchaser intends to use the Land to construct and erect on the Land an office campus and related improvements ("Purchaser's Project"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser is required to construct a parking structure (the "Parking Facility") on that portion of the Land generally described in Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Garage Parcel"), which Garage Parcel shall be ground leased by Purchaser to the City for the City's operation of the Parking Facility on the Garage Parcel.

 C. Purchaser intends to commence planning, design and construction of the Parking Facility upon approval of the Purchase Agreement. Purchaser intends to construct Purchaser's Project upon completion of construction of the Parking Facility and to continue the construction in phases over time. Development will include both subsurface work and underground structures.

 D. The Land has Recognized Environmental Conditions.1 The City has completed a Phase I environmental site assessment on the entire Land and Phase II soil and groundwater sampling and analysis on part of the Land. The City has also excavated and removed contaminated soil and investigated the nature and extent of remaining soil and groundwater contamination on part of the Land. The City has provided Purchaser with copies of reports of all of the City's investigations and remedial actions. During the due diligence period, Purchaser expects to perform a Phase II environmental site assessment on the portion of the Land where the Parking Facility will be located. The reports of the City's investigations and remedial actions and a report of the Purchaser's Phase II assessment are listed in Exhibit C attached hereto ("Environmental Studies"). These Environmental Studies document the presence of benzene, gasoline-range hydrocarbons and other Hazardous Materials (as defined in the Purchase Agreement and referenced in Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated herein) in groundwater beneath the Land at concentrations that exceed Method A cleanup levels under the Washington Model Toxics Control Act, Ch. 70.105D Revised Code of Washington ("MTCA") ("Contaminated Groundwater"). These Environmental Studies also document the presence of gasoline-, diesel- and heavy-oil range hydrocarbons and other Hazardous Materials in soil beneath the surface of the Land, some of which are at concentrations exceeding MTCA Method A cleanup levels ("Contaminated Soils").

 E. In addition to the Recognized Environmental Conditions, the Land likely has soils with residual petroleum hydrocarbons or solvents at concentrations below MTCA Method A cleanup levels but above background levels ("Impacted Soils").

 F. The parties acknowledge that the presence of Contaminated Soils and Impacted Soils beneath the surface of the Land will increase the cost of development, with the extent of any cost increase depending on the location and subsurface depth of Purchaser's Project. If Purchaser locates its Project in an area of Recognized Environmental Conditions and excavates to the depth where Contaminated Soils, Impacted Soils or Contaminated Groundwater is encountered, then Purchaser will have to conduct sampling and employ protective handling requirements, including installation of groundwater/vapor barriers, and the costs of disposal and construction are likely to be greater than they would be otherwise.

 G. The parties recognize that the Environmental Studies may not have identified all contamination on or under the Land. They agree that "Unknown Environmental Conditions" shall mean Hazardous Materials that were present on or under the Land prior to closing of the Purchase Agreement, but were discovered after closing, that differ substantially in nature or extent from the Recognized Environmental Conditions, are not de minimis, present a material risk of harm to the public health or the environment, and likely would be the subject of enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies. Unknown Environmental Conditions may occur on or under the Land or as the result of off-site migration of contamination from the Land.

 H. Pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Purchase Agreement, the City has agreed to defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from all liability and claims, subject to such releases from liability provided through this Agreement, arising out of the presence of Hazardous Materials on or under the Land at the time of closing ("Environmental Indemnity"). This Agreement is called for in the Purchase Agreement as a means of allocating responsibility, as between the Parties, for addressing Recognized Environmental Conditions and Impacted Soils on the Land.

 In consideration of the mutual agreements of the Parties contained in the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 AGREEMENTS

 1. Purchaser's Performance of Soil Remediation Work.

 1.1 General. Purchaser shall conduct, at its sole cost and expense, any and all necessary investigation and remediation on the Land with respect to Contaminated Soils that are Recognized Environmental Conditions on the Land and to Impacted Soils, other than soils addressed in association with implementation of the City's Groundwater Remediation Plan as provided for in Section 2 of this Agreement ("Soil Remediation Work"). The Soil Remediation Work includes the excavation, proper handling and disposal of soils from the Land that occurs as part of the construction and/or maintenance of Purchaser's Project and the Parking Facility, and including proper handling and disposal of any surface or groundwater associated with such construction and maintenance.

 1.2 Credit. The City agrees to pay Purchaser Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) for the Soil Remediation Work, which payment Purchaser may apply as a credit against the Purchase Price, as defined in the Purchase Agreement.

 1.3 Release for Contaminated Soils that are Recognized Environmental Conditions on the Land and for Impacted Soils. Purchaser waives and releases the City from any and all present and future claims it may have against the City, whether presently known or unknown, and whether based upon the Environmental Indemnity in the Purchase Agreement or arising under statutory or common law, with respect to Contaminated Soils that are Recognized Environmental Conditions on the Land and/or to Impacted Soils. Purchaser's waiver and release includes, but is not limited to, any costs Purchaser incurs, directly or indirectly, due to Contaminated Soils that are Recognized Environmental Conditions on the Land and/or to Impacted Soils encountered during development and/or maintenance of Purchaser's Project and/or the Parking Facility. Notwithstanding the above, Purchaser's waiver and release specifically does not include claims against the City for Unknown Environmental Conditions, claims against the City related to enforcement of this Remediation Agreement, and any City obligation to indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from third-party claims related to Impacted Soils and/or Contaminated Soils that are Recognized Environmental Conditions or Unknown Environmental Conditions on the Land.

 2. The City's Performance of Groundwater Remediation Work.

 2.1 General. The City shall conduct, at its sole cost and expense, investigation, monitoring, testing and remediation of groundwater on the Land contaminated by benzene and its associated gasoline-range constituents (the "Groundwater Remediation Work"). The approximate location and likely nature of the contaminated groundwater addressed by this section is described in Exhibit F.

 2.2 Groundwater Remediation Plan and Schedule.

 (a) By January 15, 2006, the City shall prepare and submit to Purchaser, for Purchaser's review and approval according to the criteria set forth in this subsection (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), a draft independent remedial action plan (including schedule) for performing and completing the Groundwater Remediation Work ("Draft Groundwater Remediation Plan") in compliance with MTCA and other applicable laws. The principal objective of the Groundwater Remediation Plan shall be to reduce the levels of benzene contamination and its associated gasoline-range constituents in groundwater to below applicable clean-up levels under MTCA, or to a level that the Washington Department of Ecology acknowledges is sufficient under MTCA to issue a No Further Action Determination (as described below), whichever is higher. The Parties anticipate that the approved Groundwater Remediation Plan ("Groundwater Remediation Plan") shall require active remediation of benzene-contaminated groundwater. In reviewing and approving the Groundwater Remediation Plan, Purchaser shall have the right to require such modifications to the plan that Purchaser determines are reasonably necessary to accommodate Purchaser's site development plans, site development schedule, and security and access concerns; provided, however, that if Purchaser requires modifications that would delay completion of the Groundwater Remediation Work by more than three months or increase the cost of the Groundwater Remediation Work by more than 10%, Purchaser agrees to cover the increased costs of the Groundwater Remediation Work reasonably attributable to Purchaser's delay or required modifications.

 (b) The City shall perform the Groundwater Remediation Work in accordance with the Groundwater Remediation Plan (and the schedule in the Groundwater Remediation Plan) approved by Purchaser. The Groundwater Remediation Work shall be performed and completed in accordance with applicable law and in a good and workmanlike manner, and in a manner that is consistent with all applicable requirements of any governmental permit or approval issued as a condition to the performance of the Groundwater Remediation Work. Any Hazardous Materials (as that term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) uncovered during the Groundwater Remediation Work shall be disposed of by the City at the City's sole cost and expense in accordance with applicable law.

 (c) Once the Purchaser has approved the City's Groundwater Remediation Plan, if the Purchaser intentionally or negligently disrupts or interferes with the City's implementation of the Groundwater Remediation Work, then Purchaser agrees to cover the increased costs of the Groundwater Remediation Work reasonably attributable to Purchaser's disruption or interference.

 2.3 Ecology No Further Action Determination.

 (a) As part of its Groundwater Remediation Work, the City shall, at its own expense, request a prepayment oversight agreement ("PPA") from the Washington State Department of Ecology ("Ecology") under Ecology's Voluntary Cleanup Program for technical assistance to and review of the City's Groundwater Remediation Work. Prior to beginning work under the Groundwater Remediation Plan, the City shall submit the approved Plan to Ecology for i) technical assistance and review, and ii) confirmation that completion of the Groundwater Remediation Work called for under the Plan will likely support Ecology's issuance of a No Further Action Determination (NFA) as described below.

 (b) Upon completion of the Groundwater Remediation Work under the Groundwater Remediation Plan, the City shall prepare and submit an independent remedial action report and request to Ecology for a determination that Ecology will not require further response actions, remedial investigations or cleanup actions with respect to Contaminated Groundwater on the Land (the "NFA"). The City will prepare the submission in accordance with applicable Ecology requirements and guidance.

 (c) The City shall use its best efforts to obtain the NFA; provided, however, that the City cannot and will not covenant or guarantee that it will be successful in doing so. Failure to obtain the NFA will not constitute a default by the City under this Agreement or under the Purchase Agreement (provided the City exercises its best efforts as provided in this Agreement).

 (d) Subject to the limitations provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) below, the City shall perform all actions required by Ecology as a condition of obtaining the NFA, including, without limitation, the preparation of any restrictive covenants on the Land, and performance of any groundwater sampling or monitoring during the entire period of any such sampling or monitoring required by Ecology. Purchaser agrees to draft, or assist the City in the preparation of, any restrictive covenants that may be required on the Land.

 (e) Subject to the limitations provided in paragraph (g) below, Purchaser hereby grants to the City, its employees, agents, contractors and authorized representatives, a license to enter upon the Land for purposes of carrying out the actions required under the Groundwater Remediation Plan or by Ecology as a condition of obtaining the NFA. The City agrees that it will provide reasonable advance notice to Purchaser of any planned entry, as well as schedules and locations of activity on the Land, and that it will accommodate Purchaser's reasonable requests that the City modify its scheduled entry or activities on the Land. The City further agrees that it will follow any procedures reasonably required by Purchaser to maintain privacy and security and that it will not unreasonably interrupt or interfere with Purchaser's use of the Land. Purchaser reserves the right to memorialize its ingress and egress procedures and requirements in a separate document provided to the City.

 (f) In the event that Purchaser refuses to grant the City reasonable access to the Land or Purchaser's conduct unreasonably prevents the City from performing any actions required under the Groundwater Remediation Plan or by Ecology as a condition of obtaining the NFA, the City's obligation to use its best efforts as provided in paragraph (c) above will be deemed to have been satisfied, and the City will have no further obligation to proceed in obtaining the NFA.

 (g) The City shall keep Purchaser advised and informed with respect to all negotiations with Ecology and the City's performance of all actions required under the Groundwater Remediation Plan or by Ecology as a condition of obtaining the NFA. Purchaser, and Purchaser's environmental consultants and attorneys, shall have the right to review and comment on draft reports and to confer with the City and the City's consultants prior to the City's submission of reports or information to Ecology. The City shall not agree to the placement of any restrictive covenant on the Land or to perform any response action, remedial investigation, cleanup action, or sampling or monitoring related to Contaminated Groundwater beneath the Land without Purchaser's prior written consent. Further, Purchaser shall have the right to cause the City to withdraw from the NFA process if Purchaser determines, in its reasonable discretion and after consultation with the City using the provisions of Paragraphs 2.7(a) and (b) below, that Ecology is requiring, as a condition of granting the NFA, restrictive covenants or a response action, remedial investigation, cleanup action or sampling or monitoring related to Contaminated Groundwater beneath the Land that would interfere with or interrupt Purchaser's use of the Land and have a material impact on the value of the Land. If Purchaser does not grant its written consent to restrictive covenants required by Ecology and/or exercises its right to cause the City to withdraw from the NFA process, then the City shall be deemed to have fully satisfied its obligation to seek an NFA or the equivalent from Ecology, and shall have no further obligation to Purchaser regarding contaminated groundwater, except to complete remediation and/or monitoring tasks included in the Groundwater Remediation Plan. In such event, and if the City's Project Professional determines that a failure to further address the Contaminated Groundwater on the Land is reasonably likely to result in off-site contamination in the future, the City may choose to pay Purchaser for the diminution in value of the Land resulting from the Ecology requirements and any damage to adjacent properties having already occurred as a result of Contaminated Groundwater from the Land, using an appraisal process agreeable to the Parties, in which case Purchaser shall release, indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all claims with respect to Contaminated Groundwater and the Groundwater Remediation Work.

 2.4 Project Professionals.

 (a) The City shall appoint or retain, and shall identify to Purchaser, an individual (the "Project Professional") who shall be either a Professional Engineer or other professional licensed by the State of Washington, and duly qualified to act as the oversight manager of the Groundwater Remediation Work. The initial Project Professional is:

Except in cases of emergency or where necessary to protect the public or worker health and safety, Purchaser's Designated Representative shall not interfere with the timely performance and/or completion of the Groundwater Work.

 2.5. Completion of Groundwater Remediation Work. When the Groundwater Remediation Work is completed in accordance with the Groundwater Remediation Plan and in a "Lien Free Condition," the Project Professional shall deliver a certificate to that effect to Purchaser. The Groundwater Remediation Work shall be deemed completed in a "Lien Free Condition" when (and only when):

 (a) The Project Professional certifies to Purchaser that the Groundwater Remediation Work is complete in accordance with this Agreement; and

 (b) Each contractor performing such work shall have provided unconditional lien waivers executed by that contractor and its subcontractors and materialmen with respect to that work, or, if such lien waivers have not been so obtained, a bond sufficient for such lien to be released shall have been posted, or either (i) the applicable lien period shall have expired without the filing of a lien claim or (ii) if a lien claim is timely filed, then either: (A) The City shall have caused such lien to be discharged by paying the claim or by posting a bond sufficient for such lien to be released; or (B) the time to bring an action to foreclose such lien shall have expired without the filing of such action.

 2.6 Release. Upon completion of active remediation required under the Groundwater Remediation Plan (i.e., all remediation other than any required monitoring and reporting) and receipt of the NFA or fulfillment of the City's obligations under this Agreement, Purchaser waives and releases the City from any and all claims it may have against the City arising from its Environmental Indemnity, or based upon statutory or common-law, with respect to Contaminated Groundwater and the Groundwater Remediation Work; provided, however, that this release does not extend to third party claims related to Contaminated Groundwater that are Recognized Environmental Conditions or Unknown Environmental Conditions on the Land (such as claims against Purchaser that arise from off-site migration of Contaminated Groundwater); and further provided that this release does not extend to claims relating to any monitoring or reporting required under the Groundwater Remediation Plan or by Ecology; and further provided that this release does not extend to claims arising from Unknown Environmental Conditions.

 2.7 Dispute Resolution.

 (a) Any claim or dispute between the Parties relating to the requirements of this Agreement may be submitted in writing to a formal dispute resolution process as described below. Throughout the process, Purchaser and the City shall proceed in a timely manner and in good faith to resolve such claims or disputes based on accurate and shared information and on a confidential basis.

 (b) The Parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve any dispute or claim by negotiation between representatives with decision-making power. These representatives shall not already have had prior substantive involvement in the matters involved in the dispute or claim unless the Parties otherwise agree. If resolution does not result, Purchaser and the City shall then attempt to resolve the dispute through a conference of Purchaser's Chief Financial and Administrative Officer and the City's Director of the Seattle Center and his or her designee. The procedures utilized for the conference shall include the exchange of written claims and responses, with supporting information, at least seven (7) days prior to the conference. The positions expressed, responses and submitted information shall not be admissible as evidence in any subsequent dispute resolution or legal proceeding.

 (c) If the procedure required by Paragraph (b) above does not result in resolution of the claim or dispute, then within ten (10) calendar days after the last conference meeting or final exchange of written positions, either Party may initiate a non-binding, structured mediation to be developed by the Parties with the assistance of individuals or organizations experienced in alternative dispute resolution ("ADR"). The City and Purchaser shall agree on a single qualified mediator. Such ADR process will be initiated within thirty (30) days of the request unless extended by an agreement of both Parties. The ADR procedures utilized for the mediation shall include the exchange of written claims and responses, with supporting information, at least ten (10) days prior to the actual mediation.

 (d) Purchaser and the City may agree to submit any particular claim or dispute to binding arbitration following the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules, provided, that in the event the individual arbitrators selected by the Parties cannot agree to a unanimous award, then the third arbitrator appointed by the two party arbitrators shall render the award alone after consideration of the respected Parties' arbitrators.

 2.8 Purchaser's Remedies for the City's Failure to Perform or Complete the Groundwater Remediation Work. In the event that the City does not perform or complete the Groundwater Remediation Work in accordance with the approved Groundwater Remediation Plan (including the schedule provided in the approved plan) or as required by Ecology, Purchaser shall have the following remedies, in addition to the dispute resolution process provided for in Section 2.7, provided, however, that Purchaser must first use its best efforts to resolve the situation through the dispute resolution process:

 (a) Purchaser may seek specific performance in the Superior Court of Washington for King County to cause the City to perform such obligations; and

 (b) Purchaser may elect to take over performance or completion of the Groundwater Remediation Work. If Purchaser elects to perform or to complete the Groundwater Remediation Work, Purchaser shall give written notice of Purchaser's election to the City and, upon receipt of such notice, the City shall be obligated to pay Purchaser's direct costs to complete the Groundwater Remediation Work.

 2.9 Indemnity. The City shall indemnify Purchaser, hold Purchaser harmless against and defend Purchaser, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, claims, liabilities or expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, suffered, paid or incurred by Purchaser ("Claims") (a) for bodily injury to or death of any person or loss of or damage to any property resulting from any action taken by the City or its agents, employees or contractors under or in connection with this Agreement, or (b) for the assertion of any lien or claim thereof, or any unjust enrichment claim, by any contractor or subcontractor furnishing work or any material suppler furnishing material in connection with the Groundwater Remediation Work. The foregoing obligation shall not include any Claims to the extent they arise out of or are caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser, its officers, directors, agents, employees, or contractors.

 2.10 Insurance.

 (a) The City shall, at its sole cost and expense, continuously maintain during performance of the Groundwater Remediation Work under this Agreement a liability self-insurance program generally equivalent to a commercial general liability insurance policy covering claims with respect to injuries or damages to persons or property sustained in, on or about the Land, with limits of liability of not less than Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) each occurrence. The City shall provide to Purchaser a self-insurance letter evidencing such coverage. Such liability self-insurance program shall not be materially changed or cancelled with respect to Purchaser except after thirty (30) days prior written notice from City to Purchaser.

 (b) During the performance of the Groundwater Remediation Work under this Agreement, the City shall also require its contractors and any subcontractors to maintain insurance as provided for in Exhibit E attached hereto, with coverages and limits of liability of not less than those stated in Exhibit E unless Purchaser and the City modify these requirements.

If the City cannot perform any of its obligations due to events beyond its reasonable control (other than financial distress) and despite its due diligence, the time provided for performing such obligations shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of any such event, not to exceed forty-five (45) days. Events beyond the City's reasonable control include, but are not limited to, acts of God, war, civil commotion, labor disputes, strikes, fire, flood or other casualty, shortages of labor or materials, new government regulations or restrictions, delay in issuance of a governmental permit or approval which was applied for in a timely manner, and severe weather conditions which could not be reasonably anticipated. If the City seeks to invoke force majeure, it shall notify Purchaser in writing within seventy-two (72) hours of discovering a force majeure event. The notice shall indicate the nature of the event, how the event is beyond the City's control despite reasonable due diligence, the anticipated duration and the actions the City has taken and will take before, during and after the event to minimize the delay. Failure to provide timely notice shall be deemed a waiver of force majeure by the City seeking additional time to perform an obligation under this Agreement.

 THIS AGREEMENT providing a grant of right of way assumption along Mercer Street is made and entered into as of this _____ day of ____, 200_ by and between the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("City"), and IRIS Holdings, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Purchaser") (collectively, the "Parties").

 IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual agreements of the Parties contained in that certain purchase agreement between the Parties, dated _________ (the "Purchase Agreement"), for sale of that certain real property described in Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Property"), and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Purchaser and the City hereby agree as follows:

 1. Grant of Right of Way Assumption. Purchaser grants to City the exclusive right to assume all of Purchaser's right, title and interest in up to, but no more than, fifty (50) feet of right of way along the northern property line of the Property adjoining Mercer Street between 5th Avenue and Aurora Avenue, as shown on Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Mercer Right of Way Parcel") for the sole purpose of widening Mercer Street ("Right of Assumption"). This Right of Assumption is given on the terms and conditions stated below.

 2. Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for the Mercer Right of Way Parcel shall be One Million, Six Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,600,000.00), with $100,000 payable at Closing of the sale of the Property and with $1,500,000 deferred (the "Deferred Amount") and contingent on whether or not the City exercises its Right of Assumption by September 30, 2013 ("Assumption Expiration Date") and proceeds with right of way construction by September 30, 2015 ("Construction Expiration Date").

 (a) At its election, Purchaser may either: (i) Deposit the Deferred Amount in escrow with the Title Company at Closing under the Purchase Agreement (the "Deposit"), which Deposit shall bear interest and be held in trust by the Title Company pending the City's decision to exercise its Right of Assumption as provided herein; or (ii) Provide the City with a promissory note in the amount of the Deferred Amount at Closing under the Purchase Agreement (the "Note"), which Note shall be payable to the City, Seattle Center Department, bear interest at five percent (5%) per annum and become due and owing on October 1, 2015 in the event that the City has not exercised its Right of Assumption or terminate and become null and void in the event that the City does exercise its Right of Assumption, all as provided herein.

 (b) In the event the City does not exercise, as provided below, its Right of Assumption prior to the Assumption Expiration Date, or does not initiate construction of the right of way prior to the Construction Expiration Date, then as of October 1, 2015, depending upon Purchaser's election, either the trust officer of the Title Company shall pay to the City, Seattle Center Department, an amount equal to the Deferred Amount plus actual accrued interest on the Deferred Amount or Purchaser shall pay off the Note and accrued interest. If the City does exercise its Right of Assumption by the Assumption Expiration Date, and therafter does initiate construction of the right of way by the end of the ROW Construction Term (as defined below) then, depending upon Purchaser's election, either the trust officer of the Title Company shall release the Deferred Amount plus actual accrued interest on the Deferred Amount to Purchaser or the Note shall terminate and become null and void.

 3. Term/Exercise of Right of Assumption/Escrow.

 (a) The City may exercise this Right of Assumption by giving Purchaser written notice of the City's intent to do so for the sole purpose of widening Mercer Street ("Notice of Intent to Assume ROW"), with such notice personally delivered or sent by certified mail return receipt requested on or before 5:00 p.m., September 30, 2013 (the "ROW Assumption Term"). This Right of Assumption shall terminate, and be of no further force or effect, if the City fails to provide such Notice of Intent to Assumption by the end of the ROW Assumption Term or if the City exercises this Right of Assumption but fails to initiate construction of the right of way within twenty-four (24) months of giving Notice of the Intent to Assume ROW (the "ROW Construction Term").

 (b) Within five (5) business days of written notice from the City to Purchaser of the City's decision to begin construction of the right of way ("Notice of Intent to Begin Construction"), Purchaser shall open escrow at the Title Company under the Purchase Agreement. The Parties will execute escrow instructions, not inconsistent with this Right of Assumption, as may be requested by escrow agent. Closing shall occur not later than sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Begin Construction.

 4. Title. Title to the Mercer Right of Way Parcel shall be conveyed by Bargain and Sale Deed (the "Deed") and dedicated by the City for right of way purposes (which right of way shall include a sixteen (16) foot sidewalk on the southern side of the Right of Way Parcel and allow for access between Purchaser's Property and Mercer Street). Title to be conveyed under this Right of Assumption shall be insurable, marketable and indefeasible title to the Mercer Right of Way Parcel, conveyed free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except those accepted by the City or otherwise reasonably consistent with the City's dedication and use of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel for right of way purposes (such as allowance for access between Purchaser's Property and Mercer Street) (the "Permitted Exceptions"). Title shall be insurable by a Standard Owner's Coverage Policy (Form B, rev. 10/17/70) in such amount as determined by the City, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.

 5. Physical Condition. The City shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect the Mercer Right of Way Parcel, to conduct such environmental and engineering studies as the City deems appropriate and to verify all information furnished by Purchaser from the date of the Notice of Intent to Assume through Closing of this Agreement. It is understood that Purchaser has not made, nor shall it make any representation as to the condition of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel, including, without limitation, any condition arising in connection with the use, storage or disposal of hazardous substances on or in the vicinity of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel or compliance by the Mercer Right of Way Parcel with any zoning, use or other governmental regulation applicable thereto. The City agrees to accept possession of the Right of Way Parcel in an "AS-IS" condition WITH ALL FAULTS and WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AS TO FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE; subject to Purchaser's covenants in Section 6 below.

 6. Purchaser Covenants. During the Right of Assumption Term, and through Closing of this Agreement if the City exercises this Right of Assumption, Purchaser covenants to maintain the Mercer Right of Way Parcel in good order, condition and repair, to take no action that will adversely affect title to the Mercer Right of Way Parcel, and to prevent or refrain from any use of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel for any purpose or in any manner which would adversely affect the value of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel or its intended use as a transportation corridor right of way; provided, however, that Purchaser may install landscaping, security and other improvements within the Mercer Right of Way, for which Purchaser is solely responsible and liable and may remove prior to construction of the right of way.

 7. Closing Costs.

 (a) The City and Purchaser shall each pay their own attorneys' fees. The City shall pay all closing costs, including escrow fees, the cost of recording the Deed, the title insurance premium charged by the Title Company, the cost of any survey, the cost of any endorsements, and the real estate transfer excise taxes (if any).

 (b) Purchaser shall be responsible for paying real property taxes, general assessments, utilities and operating expenses relating to the Mercer Right of Way Parcel through the date of Closing of this Agreement. Any special assessments against the Mercer Right of Way Parcel in existence as of the date of Closing shall be paid in full by Purchaser. All expenses of the Right of Way Parcel, including but not limited to, real property taxes, rents, utility charges, amounts payable under contracts, annual permits and other expenses normal to ownership, use, operation and maintenance of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel shall be prorated as of 12:01 a.m. on the date of Closing.

 (c) The City agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser, as requested, in connection with any real property tax assessment of the Mercer Right of Way Parcel through either Closing or termination of this Agreement.

 THIS RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), is made and entered into effective as of the date set forth below, by and between IRIS Holdings, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Owner"), and the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City").

 RECITALS

 A. Concurrently herewith, Owner is purchasing certain real property, more particularly described in Exhibit A, which is attached to this Agreement and incorporated herein by this reference (the "Property") from the City.

 B. As a condition of such purchase, the City requires a right of first offer to purchase the Property from Owner in the event that Owner decides to sell or ground lease (for a period greater than 25 years) any portion or all the Property to an unrelated entity.

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and other good and valuable consideration in hand paid to Owner, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by Owner, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 1. Right of First Offer.

 1.1 Grant of Offer. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Owner hereby grants to the City the right of first offer to purchase or ground lease (depending on whether Owner is seeking to sell or ground lease) the Property on the terms set forth herein if Owner desires to sell or ground lease all or a portion of the Property ("Right of First Offer") to any non-affiliated third party. For purposes of this Agreement, any reference to a ground lease as triggering any rights of City hereunder, shall only apply if the ground lease in question is for more than twenty five (25) years, inclusive of all offered extensions. The Right of First Offer shall apply to legal lots of the Property proposed for sale or ground lease, up to the whole thereof. In the event that Owner decides to sell or ground lease one or more legal lots within, but not all of, the Property (the "Sale Lots"), the Right of First Offer as it applies to the legal lots that are not for sale or ground lease shall continue in effect, regardless of whether or not the City exercised its Right of First Offer on the Sale Lots.

 1.2 Notice of Intent to Sell. Before marketing or offering all or a portion of the Property for sale or ground lease, Owner shall give the City written notice of its intent to sell or ground lease the Property or the Sale Lots, as the case may be (the "Notice of Intent to Sell"). The Notice of Intent to Sell shall identify the process for determining the price and minimum terms and conditions under which Owner would be willing to sell or ground lease the Property or the Sale Lots ("Minimum Terms"). The Minimum Terms shall be consistent with the process and terms set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement and shall provide for the form of conveyance deed or ground lease to be provided, a general description of the representations and warranties (if any) to be provided by Owner and such other matters as Owner shall deem appropriate.

 1.3 Response Period. The City shall have ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Intent to Sell to exercise the Right of First Offer to purchase the Property or the Sale Lots on the Minimum Terms (or on such other terms as mutually agreed between the City and Owner). The City must exercise its Right of First Offer in writing, and the right shall be deemed exercised only when written notice of exercise is delivered to Owner.

 1.4 Waiver of Rights. If the City does not exercise its Right of First Offer in the manner set forth above, the Right of First Offer and this Agreement shall terminate and become null and void with respect to the Property or the Sale Lots that were the subject of the Notice of Intent to Sell and, upon written request from Owner, the City shall provide a quit claim deed releasing its interest under this Agreement in the Property or the Sale Lots that were the subject of the Notice of Intent to Sell.

 1.5 Excluded Transactions. The Right of First Offer set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to any transfer to an entity affiliated with or owned or controlled by Owner, of all or any portion of the Property.

 2. Terms and Conditions.

 2.1 Purchase Price or Rent. The total purchase price or rent for the Property or the Sale Lots shall be the Fair Market Value of the Property or the Sale Lots, as defined below. The Purchase Price shall be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Intent to Sell. As used herein, the term "Fair Market Value" shall mean the fair market sale or ground rental value for the Property or the Sale Lots, together with any improvements located thereon, and shall be determined by the following appraisal procedure:

 (i) Within fifteen (15) days following receipt of written notice from the City that it intends to exercise its Right of First Offer (the "Notice of Intent to Buy"), the City and Owner shall retain a mutually agreed upon M.A.I. Appraiser to determine the Fair Market Value of the Property or the Sale Lots and provide an appraisal. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the City. The appraiser thus selected shall proceed to appraise the Property or the Sale Lots, as appropriate, to determine the Fair Market Value of the Property or the Sale Lots and provide an appraisal within sixty (60) days of being retained.

 (ii) If Owner and the City cannot agree upon an M.A.I Appraiser within fifteen (15) days as provided above, then each party shall obtain a separate appraisal performed by an appraiser meeting the criteria set forth above, the cost of which shall be paid by each party to its separately contracted appraiser and which appraisal shall be completed within sixty (60) days of the due date for agreeing upon an M.A.I. Appraiser. If the conclusions of the two appraisers do not vary by in excess of 10% from the higher valuation, then the Fair Market Value shall be the average of the two conclusions. If the conclusions vary by more than 10%, then the two appraisers shall join to appoint a third appraiser within ten (10) days of the date of completion of their appraisals. Such third appraiser shall then review the two appraisals and, based upon such review, determine the Fair Market Value within thirty (30) days of the date of appointment. Such determination shall be binding upon each of the parties, provided that in the event such third appraiser's determination is higher than the previous high, said previous high shall be the Fair Market Value, or in the event such third appraiser's determination is lower than the previous low, said previous low shall be the Fair Market Value. The cost of the third appraiser, if any, shall be shared equally between the parties.

 2.2 Period for Due Diligence Investigation. Closing of this transaction is conditioned on the City's satisfaction with the Property or the Sale Lots, the suitability of the Property or the Sale Lots for the City's intended uses and the feasibility of this transaction in the City's sole and absolute discretion. The City shall have ninety (90) days following receipt of the Notice of Intent to Buy to conduct its investigation (the "Contingency Period"), provided that the Contingency Period shall not end until 30 days after a final appraisal has been received pursuant to Section 2.1(ii). If the City fails to notify Owner in writing that this condition is satisfied or waived prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the final day of the Contingency Period, then this Agreement and the Right of First Offer shall be deemed terminated and null and void, and both Owner and the City shall be released and discharged from all further obligations under this Agreement, with respect to the Property or the Sale Lots that were the subject of the Notice of Intent to Sell. Upon written request from Owner, the City shall provide a quit claim deed releasing its interest under this Agreement in the Property or the Sale Lots that were the subject of the Notice of Intent to Sell.

 2.3 Closing Date. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Property or the Sale Lots pursuant to this Agreement ("Closing") shall be held, and delivery of all items to be made at Closing under the terms of this Agreement shall be made, at a location mutually agreeable to the Parties and within twenty (20) days after the end of the City's Contingency Period ("Closing Date").

 2.4 Closing Costs. Owner shall pay the premium for a standard coverage owner's policy of title insurance, and real estate excise taxes applicable to the sale of the Property or the Sale Lots (if any are due). The City shall pay the cost of recording the deed to the Property or the Sale Lots and the additional premium for an extended coverage policy of title insurance, if any. Owner and the City shall each pay one half (1/2) of any closing fees that may be associated with the Closing. All other costs and charges of the escrow for the sale not otherwise provided for herein shall be allocated in accord with applicable closing customs for the county in which the Property is located, as determined by the escrow company.

 2.5 Environmental Indemnity. The Owner shall defend, indemnify and hold City harmless from all liability and claims arising out of the presence of Hazardous Materials on or under the Land that are caused by acts or omissions of the Owner or its agents.

 3. Assignment. This Agreement and the Right of First Offer may not be assigned or transferred by the City, without the prior written consent of Owner in its sole and absolute discretion.

 4. Notices. Notices given hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given and received on the date of personal delivery or three (3) business days after mailing if mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. The addresses of the Owner and the City are indicated for each such party under their signature below, respectively, and such addresses may be modified by ten (10) days advance written notice to the other parties hereto.

 5. Run with the Land. This Agreement shall run with the land and shall be binding upon Owner's heirs, successors and assigns.

 6. Breach, Remedy. This Agreement pertains to the conveyance or ground lease of real property, the unique nature of which is hereby acknowledged by the parties. Consequently, if Owner breaches or defaults under this Agreement, the City shall have, in addition to a claim for damages for such breach or default, and in addition and without prejudice to any other right or remedy available under this Agreement or at law or in equity, the right (a) to specific performance of this Agreement; or (b) to terminate this Agreement upon written notice without liability to Owner.

 7. Attorneys' Fees. If either party brings an action or other proceeding against the other party to enforce any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or any instrument executed pursuant to this Agreement, or by reason of any breach or default hereunder or thereunder, the party prevailing in any such action or proceeding shall be paid all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees by the other party, and in the event any judgment is obtained by the prevailing party all such costs and attorneys' fees shall be included in the judgment.

 8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, modified, amended or terminated except by a written agreement of the parties hereto.

 9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington.

 10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
