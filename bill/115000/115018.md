 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City of Seattle 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development; adopting the Consolidated Plan, including certain policies governing the use of funds for housing, and authorizing its submission to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") has required local jurisdictions seeking federal assistance to develop a Consolidated Plan to bring together the principal housing planning documents and the applications for four federal formula grant programs, including the Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG"), HOME Investment Partnerships, Emergency Shelter Grant ("ESG"), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS ("HOPWA") programs, in one document; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, including the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects, and has requested that the City Council adopt the Plan and authorize its submission to HUD; and

 WHEREAS, there has been a public involvement process in the development of the Mayor's Proposed 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development and that document has been available for public review and comment for thirty (30) days; the Mayor and City Council have considered the public comments on the proposed plan and have made such revisions as they have considered appropriate in the public interest;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle City Council hereby adopts the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, attached hereto as Attachment 1 ("Adopted Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the conditions, limitations and potential amendments as set forth in this ordinance.

 Section 2.

 A. The Adopted Plan, with any amendments as authorized in this ordinance, shall serve as the City's application to HUD for the grant funding for the programs set forth in the recitals above for the federal fiscal year 2005 and, as supplemented by Action Plans to be adopted in future years, shall serve as the City's application for such grant funding in fiscal years 2006-2008. The Adopted Plan is intended to serve the functions described in 24 CFR Section 91.1(b). Except as may be required by federal law applicable to consolidated plans, or as expressly set forth in this Section 2, the terms of the Adopted Plan are not intended to have further or additional legal effect.

 B. In addition, the policies set forth in the sections of Appendix H to the Adopted Plan that are listed on Attachment 2 to this ordinance are adopted to provide direction for the use by the Office of Housing of the fund sources indicated in those sections for the programs indicated. Those policies may be amended only by ordinance. As of January 1, 2005, those policies supersede the Housing Funding Policies contained in the City's 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan, as amended ("Existing Plan"). The Housing Funding Policies in the Existing Plan, as well as the other Citywide Funding Policies and policies for specific neighborhoods in the Existing Plan, shall have no further effect after December 31, 2004, except that policies in the Existing Plan expressly applicable to use of funds appropriated through 2004 shall continue to apply to the use of those funds after 2004, and where funds are awarded or reserved for projects by the Office of Housing prior to January 1, 2005, funds appropriated through 2004 may be used after 2004 for those projects, consistent with the policies in the Existing Plan, without regard to any change in policy reflected in the Adopted Plan. The policies in the sections listed on Attachment 2 to this ordinance do not supersede policies adopted for the 2002 Housing Levy (or any prior housing levy); however, where the policies in those sections of Appendix H to the Adopted Plan expressly apply to housing levy funds, those policies provide additional direction for the use of those funds.

 Section 3. The Adopted Plan contains, in addition to strategies and policies being adopted by the City for the purposes stated in Section 2, descriptions of various existing or proposed ordinances, rules, programs, strategies or policies of the City, its departments or offices, or other agencies such as the Seattle Housing Authority. Those descriptions are intended to describe or summarize ordinances, rules, programs, strategies or policies that are adopted, and may be revised or amended, independent of the Adopted Plan, and not to require amendment of the Adopted Plan for any changes to them, nor to modify or supersede existing ordinances, programs or policies, nor to give such strategies or policies any new or additional legal effect.

 Section 4. The allocations set forth in the Adopted Plan do not constitute appropriations or modify the amounts of any existing appropriations, nor are they to be considered as final funding decisions. The authority of the respective City departments and offices to implement the activities set forth in the Adopted Plan is subject to sufficient appropriations in the 2005 Adopted Budget or in any separate ordinance. Implementation of any specific project or program is also subject to a final determination by the appropriate office or department after completion of any necessary review under environmental and related laws. No part of the Adopted Plan is intended to confer any legal rights or entitlements on any persons, groups or entities.

 Section 5. The Mayor and the Director of Human Services ("the Director") and their designees are hereby authorized to submit the Adopted Plan, together with any necessary supplementary material, to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") as the application by the City for financial assistance under certain HUD programs; to represent the City in seeking HUD approval of the Adopted Plan, to make and submit to

 HUD such modifications to the Adopted Plan as HUD may require, provided that no substantial policy changes are involved; and to sign and deliver on behalf of the City such assurances and certifications as may be necessary to obtain HUD approval. The Director is further authorized to make such technical and conforming changes to the Adopted Plan as she may deem reasonably necessary, and to amend the Adopted Plan, if necessary or appropriate under federal regulations, to reflect funding of specific activities, final appropriations for the programs or lines of business in any Adopted Budget, or changes in activities that are consistent with the policies and priorities established in the Plan. Any substantial amendment as defined by the adopted Citizen Participation Plan for the Consolidated Plan, as adopted by Ordinance 121083, shall be effective only if approved by ordinance or resolution of the City Council.

 Section 6. No later than July 15, 2005, the Director shall submit a proposed ordinance with amendments to the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects to the City Council's Housing, Human Services and Health Committee. The amendments to the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects shall identify any revised allocations made by the Director prior to such submission, and any further revisions to allocations proposed, relating to the Community Development Block Grant, HOME Investment Partnerships, Emergency Shelter Grant, and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS programs.

 Section 7.

 A. By March 31, 2005, the Director of the Office of Housing will provide a report to the Housing, Human Services and Health Committee on possible revisions to the HomeWise Single Family Rehabilitation Program funding, structure and staffing. This report will include information on the following: Obtaining additional private or non- profit resources to leverage City funding resulting in an expanded HomeWise program; targeting a portion of program funding to certain neighborhoods for use, in part, as a revitalization tool in distressed neighborhoods while also continuing to provide program funding to serve fixed-income elderly city-wide; modifying program goals and repair priorities to permit the use of program funds for targeted revitalization efforts.

 B. By April 29, 2005, the Director of Human Services shall provide to the Housing, Human Services and Health Committee, a draft of the proposed Request for Proposal (RFP) for Shelter and Transitional Housing Services. HSD will develop an outcome-based RFP for these services that incorporates the following: minimum physical and programmatic standards for shelters (which can vary depending on the type of shelter, with potential examples including a "winter response" shelter, "interim" shelter, or longer term shelter for the chronically homeless). These standards shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in King County's Plan to End Homelessness as well as other City policies. The RFP will also include outcome goals for transitional housing services. The draft RFP shall be submitted to the Housing, Human Services and Health Committee for review before issuing the RFP in 2005.

 Section 8. Any action pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
