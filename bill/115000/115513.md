 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, extending for six months interim zoning authorized originally through Ordinance 121789 to prohibit uses incompatible with transit-oriented and pedestrian- oriented development within the Crown Hill Residential Urban Village located in the vicinity of 15th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 85th Street; and declaring an emergency.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby adopts the following legislative findings of fact:

 a. On April 25, 2005 the Council passed Ordinance 121789 establishing an interim pedestrian overlay in the vicinity of 15th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 85th Street in the Crown Hill Residential Urban Village. Among other things, this interim overlay was intended to preclude development inconsistent with the proposed location of a future monorail transit station.

 b. Anticipating dissolution of the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority, in the 2006 Budget the Council allocated $628,000 to the Seattle Department of Transportation to analyze transit alternatives on the former monorail "green line" corridor inclusive of the Crown Hill Residential Urban Village.

 c. The Comprehensive Plan incorporates the policies CH / B - P2 and CH / B - P9 from the Crown Hill / Ballard Neighborhood Plans that emphasize creation of pleasant streetscapes.

 d. It continues to be in the public interest that land use and development in the vicinity of 15th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 85th Street be compatible with the Crown Hill/Ballard and Ballard Interbay Northend Manufacturing Industrial Area Neighborhood Plans, help support transit operations, and freight mobility. This policy is consistent with the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, and with state policies including, but not limited to, those contained in Chapter 81.104, RCW.

 e. According to the Seattle's Comprehensive Plan and the Transportation Strategic Plan, 15th Avenue Northwest is designated as a Major Truck Street whose purpose is to accommodate freight movement through the city and to and from major freight traffic generators. It is also designated a Principal Arterial, or a regional connector, intended to move a substantial amount of people and goods. As a major truck street[mk1], 15th Avenue Northwest is essential to the City's economic development and viability.

 f. It continues to be in the public interest that a reasonable balance be achieved among competing users of streets (pedestrians, transit, bicyclists, freight, cars, landscaping, utilities, and parking) when designing streets and installing street lights. Therefore, a reasonable balance must be achieved between making pedestrian-friendly street improvements in the vicinity of 15th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 85th Street and ensuring that 15th Avenue Northwest continue to act as a Major Truck Route. Improvements that may impede freight mobility include non- synchronized traffic lights, midblock crosswalks, pedestrian over- ride traffic signals, curb cuts and driveways, or an activity that impedes truck turning radius requirements.

 g. The City is currently studying proposed changes to Pedestrian Overlay Zones in the Crown Hill Residential Village and at various other locations as well as changes to standards for auto-oriented uses in Neighborhood Commercial Zones as part of the Neighborhood Business District Strategy. The Neighborhood Business District Strategy legislation is scheduled for adoption in the Summer of 2006.

 h. The City has been apprised of development projects in the vicinity of 15th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 85th Street that may establish vested rights and result in uses that are incompatible with desired land uses before permanent pedestrian zone designations are effective, and therefore, the City's ability to implement these City and state policies may be compromised or thwarted.

 i. The City is authorized to adopt interim zoning ordinances to prevent vesting of development rights pursuant to, among other authority, Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, and the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A, RCW.

 Section 2. The interim zoning adopted by Ordinance 121789 is extended for six months and shall expire on October 1, 2006.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Section 4. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provisions shall not affect the validity of any other provision.
