 ORDINANCE ___________

 AN ORDINANCE of the City of Seattle, Washington, ordering the construction of a modern streetcar line serving downtown Seattle, Denny Triangle and South Lake Union all in accordance with Resolution No. 30786; establishing Local Improvement District No. 6750 and ordering the carrying out of the proposed improvement; providing that payment for the improvement be made in part by special assessments upon the property in the Local Improvement District, payable by the mode of "payment by bonds"; creating a local improvement fund; authorizing the issuance of local improvement bonds; and providing for interfund loans and for the issuance and sale of local improvement district warrants or other short-term financing instruments, all by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 30786 adopted August 1, 2005, the City Council declared its intention to order the construction of a modern streetcar line serving downtown Seattle, Denny Triangle and South Lake Union, and fixed September 22, 2005, at 5:00 p.m., local time, in the Council Chambers of the City Hall as the time and place for hearing all matters relating to the proposed improvement and all comments thereon and objections thereto and for determining the method of payment for the improvement; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Transportation caused an estimate to be made of the cost and expense of the proposed improvement and certified that estimate to the City Council, together with all papers and information in her possession touching the proposed improvement, a description of the boundaries of the proposed local improvement district and a statement of what portion of the cost and expense of the improvement should be borne by the property within the proposed district; and

 WHEREAS, that estimate is accompanied by a diagram of the proposed improvement showing thereon the lots, tracts, parcels of land, and other property which will be specially benefited by the proposed improvement and the estimated cost and expense thereof to be borne by each lot, tract and parcel of land or other property; and

 WHEREAS, due notice of the above hearing was given in the manner provided by law, and the hearing was held by the City Council on the date and at the time above mentioned, and all comments on the proposed improvement (including any and all objections) were duly considered by the City Council, and all persons appearing at such hearing and wishing to be heard were heard; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined it to be in the best interests of the City that the improvement as hereinafter described be carried out and that a local improvement district be created in connection therewith; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Improvement Ordered

 . Pursuant to RCW 35.42.040(16), the City Council of The City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), orders the construction of a modern streetcar line serving downtown Seattle, Denny Triangle and South Lake Union.

 All of the foregoing shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications therefore prepared by the Director of Transportation of the Seattle Department of Transportation, and may be modified by the City Council as long as such modification does not affect the purpose of the improvement.

 Section 2. Local Improvement District Created

 . There is created and established a local improvement district to be called Local Improvement District No. 6750 of the City of Seattle, Washington (the "LID"), the boundaries or territorial extent of the LID being more particularly described in Exhibit A attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein.

 Section 3. Allocation of Costs

 . The total estimated cost and expense of design and construction of the improvement is declared to be $47,500,000, and the costs of administration, creation and formation of the LID, including, without limitation, bond issuance costs and legal costs (collectively, the "LID administration costs") are declared to be $700,000 and shall be incorporated into the cost and expense of the improvements. Approximately $25,000,000 of the cost and expense of the improvements together with the $700,000 of LID administration cost shall be borne by and assessed against the property specially benefited by such improvement included in the LID which embraces as nearly as practicable all property specially benefited by such improvement and the balance of such cost and expense shall be paid by other amounts available to the City for that purpose. However, if and to the extent that the actual cost and expense of the improvements (including LID administration costs) varies from the current estimates, the change in costs may be assessed against the property specially benefited by such improvement, and actual assessments may vary from estimated assessments as long as they do not exceed a figure equal to the increased true and fair value the improvements add to the property. The City Council intends that any interim financing costs be added to LID administration costs and allocated to the properties assessed. In addition, the Council directs the Executive to increase the total amount of the Local Improvement District in the Final Assessment Roll by any assessment amount allocated to a property that is exempt from paying such assessment and that this amount shall be included in the hearing notice for the Final Assessment Roll to be mailed to property owners.

 Section 4. Method of Assessment

 . In accordance with the provisions of RCW 35.44.047, the City may use any method or combination of methods to compute assessments which may be deemed to more fairly reflect the special benefits to the properties being assessed than the statutory method of assessing the properties.

 Section 5. Authorization of Local Improvement Bonds and Interim Financing

 . The City is authorized to issue local improvement district bonds for the LID which shall bear interest at a rate and be payable on or before a date or dates to be hereafter fixed by ordinance. The bonds shall be issued to pay for the costs of the improvements and to repay interfund loans and in exchange for and/or in redemption of any and all interest-bearing warrants, installment notes or other short-term obligations hereafter issued for the LID. The bonds shall be paid and redeemed by the collection of special assessments to be levied and assessed against the property within the LID, payable in annual installments, with interest at a rate to be hereafter fixed by ordinance under the mode of "payment by bonds," as defined by law and the ordinances of the City. The exact form, amount, date, interest rate and denominations of such bonds hereafter shall be fixed by ordinance of the City Council.

 Local improvement district warrants may be issued in payment of the cost and expense of the improvement herein ordered to be assessed, such warrants to be paid out of the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6750, hereinafter created and referred to as the Local Improvement Fund, and, until the bonds referred to in this section are issued and delivered to the purchaser thereof, to bear interest from the date thereof at a rate to be established hereafter by the City Director of Finance, as issuing officer, and to be redeemed in cash and/or by local improvement district bonds herein authorized to be issued, such interest-bearing warrants to be hereafter referred to as "interest-bearing warrants." In the alternative, with the approval of the City Council by resolution, the Director of Finance may provide for the issuance of short-term obligations pursuant to chapter 39.50 RCW, or for the issuance of local improvement district installment notes in accordance with applicable law and ordinances of the City.

 In anticipation of the issuance of the bonds authorized by this Section 5, the Director of Finance or his designee is authorized to loan funds from the City's Consolidated Cash Pool or its participating funds to the Local Improvement Fund, for a period beginning with the effective date of this ordinance and terminating not later than December 31, 2006. The Director of Finance may effectuate this interfund loan by allowing the Local Improvement Fund to be in a negative cash position no greater than $5,000,000 at any one time, exclusive of interest charges. The Director of Finance is further authorized to establish, and modify if necessary, from time to time, a repayment plan and schedule, including interest at the rate earned by funds participating in the Consolidated Cash Pool, for the interfund loan authorized by this ordinance, requiring such interfund loan to be repaid not later than December 31, 2006.

 If the City shall authorize expenditures to be made for such improvement (other than for any cost or expense expected to be borne by the City) prior to the date that any short-term obligations or local improvement district bonds are issued to finance the improvement, from proceeds of interfund loans or other funds that are not, and are not reasonably expected to be, reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or otherwise set aside to pay the cost of the improvement herein ordered to be assessed against the property specially benefited thereby, the City declares its official intent that those expenditures in a principal amount not exceeding $5,000,000, to the extent not reimbursed with prepaid special benefit assessments, are to be reimbursed from proceeds of short-term obligations or local improvement district bonds that are expected to be issued for the improvement.

 Section 6. Construction of Improvements; Payment for Improvements

 . In all cases where the work necessary to be done in connection with the making of such improvement is carried out pursuant to contract upon competitive bids (and the City shall have and reserves the right to reject any and all bids), the contracts shall include a statement that payment for such work will be made in cash warrants or checks drawn upon the Local Improvement Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the provisions of any other ordinance of the City, unless the authority to proceed is restrained by protest under RCW 35.43.180, the improvements may be carried out in whole or in part under the provisions of Chapter 39.10 RCW. The Director of Transportation may proceed with negotiating a proposed Maximum Allowable Construction Contract with a general contractor- construction manager. The Director of Transportation is authorized to execute a MACC only after Council approves that dollar amount of the MACC by Council resolution. The Director may proceed with the purchase of streetcar vehicles, provided that the vehicle procurement contract is consistent with the finance plan filed as Clerk File No. 307392. Notwithstanding any other ordinance of the City, the Director of Executive Administration may issue checks drawn upon the Local Improvement Fund created in Section 7. to the extent that there is money in that fund, to pay for the cost or expense of the improvements within the LID.

 Section 7. Local Improvement Fund Created

 . The Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6750, is created and established in the City Treasury. The proceeds of interfund loans, and from the sale of interest-bearing warrants or other short-term obligations drawn against the fund which may be issued and sold by the City, and the collections of special assessments, interest and penalties thereon, shall be deposited in the Local Improvement Fund. Amounts in Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6750 shall be used for the redemption of warrants and funding of checks to provide payment for the cost and expense of the improvements within the LID and for the redemption of bonds and other obligations incurred to pay for the improvements.

 Section 8. Restraint by Protest

 . The jurisdiction of the City Council to proceed with the improvement may be divested by protests filed with the City Council within 30 days of the Council's passage of this ordinance, all in accordance with RCW 35.43.180.

 Section 9. Filing of Preliminary Assessment Roll

 . Not later than 15 days after the passage of this ordinance, the Director of Transportation shall file with the Director of Executive Administration the title of the improvement and LID number, a copy of the diagram or print showing the boundaries of the LID and the preliminary assessment roll or abstract of such roll showing thereon the lots, tracts and parcels of land that will be specially benefited thereby and the estimated cost and expense of such improvement to be borne by each lot, tract or parcel of land. The Director of Executive Administration immediately shall post the proposed assessment roll upon his index of local improvement assessments against the properties affected by the local improvement.

 Section 10. Section Headings

 . The Section headings in this ordinance are used for convenience only and shall not constitute a substantive portion of this ordinance.

 Section 11. Effective Date

 . This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
