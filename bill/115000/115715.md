 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Ethics Code, amending SMC Chapter 4.16 and adding new sections to this Chapter.

 WHEREAS, advisory boards and commissions do not have the authority to enact, administer, interpret, or execute City laws, but rather simply to provide advice or recommendations to City entities that do have such authority; and,

 WHEREAS, the City seeks to encourage qualified people to serve as volunteers on advisory boards and commissions while also conducting their ordinary course of business and related affairs; and,

 WHEREAS, all persons subject to the provisions of the Ethics Code, including members of advisory boards and commissions, are required to operate in an ethical manner that maintains the public trust in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts; and,

 WHEREAS, the prohibitions in SMC 4.16.070.1(a) and SMC 4.16.070.1(b) may unnecessarily deter qualified individuals from volunteering on advisory boards and commissions but are necessary for paid City Officers and employees to foster transparent and accountable local government; and,

 WHEREAS, the City intends that in considering whether to impose fines and at what level to assess fines pursuant to SMC 4.16.100 the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission will continue to consider the magnitude of the financial interest that underlies the violation and the degree to which the violation was knowing and intentional; and,

 WHEREAS, requiring members of advisory boards or commissions to disqualify themselves if they have a direct or indirect financial conflict of interest in a matter before the board or commission is necessary to protect impartiality and public confidence in advisory boards and commissions; and,

 WHEREAS, requiring members of advisory boards and commissions to fully disclose in public any and all circumstances giving rise to a possible appearance of conflict prior to engaging in the performance of official duties meets the twin goals of transparency in government and recruitment of qualified individuals to serve on advisory boards and commissions; and,

 WHEREAS, although the Ethics and Elections Commission would be able to impose monetary fines on volunteer members of advisory boards and commissions in limited circumstances, in appropriate situations it could also take other actions in response to violations of the Ethics Code by such persons, including: 1) recommending prosecution for violations of the Ethics Code that also constitute violations of other laws, 2) seeking reimbursement for damages caused by a violation and costs related to the investigation, 3) recommending the cancellation or rescission of City actions influenced by the violation, 4) recommending censure or removal of members of advisory boards and commissions who violate the Ethics Code, and 5) recommending to advisory committees that findings or recommendations substantially influenced by violations be rescinded or reconsidered; and,

 WHEREAS, advisory boards and commissions do not engage in the type of proceedings to which SMC 4.16.075.B.1 applies; and,

 WHEREAS, all persons subject to the provisions of the Ethics Code, including members of advisory boards and commissions, are encouraged to seek advisory opinions from the Ethics and Elections Commission or its Director prior to engaging in conduct that might violate the Ethics Code; and,

 WHEREAS, the Council intends to monitor the effectiveness of changes to the Ethics Code as applied to advisory committees and make further changes as appropriate in the future;

 2. Recommend to the advisory committee that any finding or recommendation of the committee that has been substantially influenced by the violation be rescinded or reconsidered.

 Each act that violates one or more provisions of Chapter 4.16 may constitute a separate violation. Violation may be proven by a preponderance of evidence, and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

 Section 4. SMC Chapter 4.16 is amended by adding a new Section 4.16.085 to read as follows:

 SMC 4.16.085 Advisory Opinions - Effect on Enforcement.

 The Commission shall not find a person's conduct violates this chapter if: 1) the person has submitted to the Executive Director or to the Commission a written request for an advisory opinion;

 2) the request describes possible future conduct and accurately and fully discloses the material facts related to that conduct; 3) the Executive Director or the Commission issues a written advisory opinion that the described conduct would not violate this chapter; and 4) the person, in reasonable reliance on the advisory opinion, acts in a manner consistent with that advisory opinion. If a person asserts this section as a defense in an enforcement action brought under this chapter, the Executive Director shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that this subsection does not apply. An advisory opinion issued by the Executive Director shall have no binding effect in any other proceeding.

 Section 5. Section 4.16.105 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 SMC 4.16.105 ~~Employee a~~Appeal of fine.

 A. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, if the Commission imposes a monetary fine for violation of any provision of this chapter, the City officer or employee on whom the fine is imposed may appeal the fine, on the Commission's record, to the Seattle Municipal Court. The Seattle Municipal Court shall uphold the Commission's decision if it determines the Commission's decision was not for any arbitrary, capricious, or illegal reason, and the decision was supported by substantial evidence in the Commission's record. Otherwise, the Court shall modify, reverse, or remand the matter to the Commission, as the Court deems appropriate.

 B. In order to appeal a monetary fine imposed under this chapter by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, the City  officer or employee on whom the fine is imposed must file a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Municipal Court, serve it upon The City of Seattle, and deliver a copy to the Executive Director of the Commission, all within twenty (20) days after the date of the Commission's decision. In order to file the notice of appeal, the City officer or employee must pay to the Clerk of the Municipal Court a filing fee in the amount set by statute or court rule for a civil action filed in the District Courts. The filing fee and the costs of preparing the record of the proceedings of the Commission may be taxed as costs against the nonprevailing party, as the Municipal Court may direct, but each party shall bear its own attorney's fees. The notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall include the mailing address and, if different, the street address where papers may be served on the appellant. The notice of appeal shall contain, in separate numbered paragraphs, statements of the specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, or aspects of the fine on which the appellant seeks review, the basis for the appeal, and a brief statement of the relief requested. The appellant shall attach a copy of the written decision of the Commission being appealed.

 C. Within thirty (30) days after the notice of appeal has been properly filed, served, and a copy delivered to the Executive Director, the appellant shall provide the Executive Director with a record of proceedings, which the Executive Director shall, if it complies with this subsection, promptly file with the Municipal Court so as to present the issues raised for review. Upon payment of the costs of copying, the Executive Director shall provide the appellant a copy of the relevant papers and exhibits, which shall be included in the record. The record shall also include a transcript of those portions of the testimony that are designed by the appellant or by the Executive Director, who shall each designate what they believe necessary to resolve disputed issues. The appellant at his or her expense shall submit to the Executive Director for review and approval, if accurate, the transcript of the designated portions of the testimony, prepared by a certified court reporter. The typed transcript, when certified as accurate by the Executive Director, shall constitute the record for review of the portion so transcribed. If all or a designated part of a tape recording is not audible, the Executive Director may prepare and certify a summary of that portion of the testimony in the proceedings based on his or her notes and memory. Where the Executive Director and the appellant agree that the testimony or facts are not in dispute, they may jointly prepare a narrative report of some or all of the evidence or a summary of some or all of the testimony in order to reduce the amount of material transcribed and to make a more compact record.

 D. Except where inconsistent with this section, the procedural rules of the Civil Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (CRLJs), as they may be amended from time to time, shall govern procedure related to the appeal in the Municipal Court, but no new evidence may be submitted to or taken by the Municipal Court.

 E. The Municipal Court shall appoint a judge pro tempore to hear appeals by employees of the Municipal Court unless both the City employee and the Executive Director agree that a regular Municipal Court judge may hear the case.

 F. This section shall not apply to (1) City officials elected by the public, (2) the Deputy Mayor, if any, (3) heads of departments and Executive Department offices, ~~(4) members of boards and commissions, and (5)~~and (4) those City employees who are represented by a labor union that, on the date the charges were filed had not reached written agreement with the City regarding the appeal to Municipal Court of monetary fines imposed by the Commission. Persons for whom an appeal to Seattle Municipal Court is not authorized by this section may seek review of a monetary fine imposed by the Commission in King County Superior Court as provided in state law.

 Section 6.

 E. Any suggestions for further revisions to the Ethics Code provisions related to advisory committees.

 Section 7. The Mayor's Office is requested to provide a written report to the City Council no later than one year and 90 days after the effective date of this ordinance on the effectiveness of these amendments to the Ethics Code as applied to advisory committees. The report should include but not be limited to:
