 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Fleets and Facilities Department, amending the 2004 Adopted Budget by increasing and decreasing appropriations for certain capital projects.

 WHEREAS, the 2004-2009 Adopted Capital Improvement Program for the Fleets and Facilities Department (FFD) includes the Lake City Civic Core project, a multi-departmental undertaking that involves the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Seattle Public Library, the Department of Neighborhoods, and FFD, and that has widespread public interest; and

 WHEREAS FFD's portion of the project, which comprises an underground parking garage, elevator, and public plaza, is estimated to cost $977,000 more than is currently appropriated in the 2004 FFD adopted budget due to cost inflation of construction materials, insufficient contingency set aside, and unexpected costs related to design refinements; and

 WHEREAS, necessary supplemental funding for the Lake City Civic Core project can be provided through transfer of existing budget authority within the Charles Street Improvements program; and

 WHEREAS, such transfer is possible due to the indefinite deferral of the lower-priority Vactor Storage Building project at the Charles Street vehicle maintenance complex; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The 2004 appropriation shown in parentheses below is reduced from the Budget Control Level as shown, and re-appropriated as shown without parentheses as follows:

 Section 2. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.
