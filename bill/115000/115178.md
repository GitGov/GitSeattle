 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Mayor to enter into a substitute agreement with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority to provide more flexible funding for the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle, authorizing expenditures consistent with an approved operating plan for the Fund and amending the 2003 and 2004 Action Plans to the 2001 - 2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development and the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects to the 2005 - 2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, consistent with the substitute agreement.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120796, passed by the Council on April 29, 2002, authorized the Mayor to enter into a Community Development Fund Agreement (the "2002 Funding Agreement") with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit") to establish, oversee, and fund Seattle's portion of the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle ("the Fund"); and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121021 passed by the Council on December 9, 2002, adopted an operating plan ("the Plan") to govern the initial activities of the Fund, including supplemental mitigation of impacts to Rainier Valley businesses due to Link light rail construction; apprenticeship preparation for residents of the Rainier Valley; and preparation of receiving sites for businesses requiring relocation as a result of Link light rail construction; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle ("the City") and Sound Transit have subsequently contracted with the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund ("the RVCDF") to implement the initial Plan and prepare a future amendment to the Plan to govern the community and transit-oriented development activities of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, construction of light rail is now underway, the relocation of impacted businesses is substantially complete, and the RVCDF now projects needing fewer funds for the supplemental mitigation activities of the Fund than originally projected in the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the RVCDF is developing a proposed amendment to the Plan for the transit-oriented and community development activities of the Fund and anticipates forwarding the draft amendment to the City and Sound Transit for review and approval in early 2005; and

 WHEREAS, the 2002 Funding Agreement required the City to fund $21.3 million for community development activities through Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) contributions of $13.5 million and General Subfund contributions of $7.8 million; and

 WHEREAS, the 2002 Funding Agreement required Sound Transit to make payments of up to $21.5 million to capitalize the Fund to be offset by equivalent City investments in the light rail project; and

 WHEREAS, the City has worked aggressively to identify and implement a substitute funding mechanism to fully capitalize the Fund in a manner that provides flexibility to meet the purposes of the Fund and the needs of the community and the Mayor has recommended that the City Council authorize a Substitute Community Development Fund Agreement ("Substitute Funding Agreement") that would replace the 2002 Funding Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Sound Transit funds are well suited to pay for the supplemental mitigation costs of businesses impacted by Link light rail construction as set forth in the Plan, but these Sound Transit funds lack the flexibility for other desired activities consistent with the broader mission of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the RVCDF anticipates investing in job creation and business and real estate development in the Rainier Valley as part of the long- term community and transit-oriented development activities of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, CDBG funds distributed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are a source of funds well suited to develop real estate, invest in businesses, and create jobs in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods like the Rainier Valley; and

 WHEREAS, the City, in its role of being a recipient of CDBG funds, has determined that CDBG funds can appropriately be used for purposes included in the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the RVCDF qualifies under HUD regulations as a "Community Based Development Organization" and is operating within a HUD approved "Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area" for the Rainier Valley; and

 WHEREAS, CDBG funds are also a source of funds that can be revolved and used many times over for future investment in the Rainier Valley to help accomplish the mission of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the City's variety of funding sources provide flexibility to achieve the goals and objectives of the RVCDF; and

 WHEREAS, the City's commitment to implement this new CDBG-based strategy to fully capitalize the Fund is confirmed with this Substitute Funding Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121256, passed September 2, 2003, amended the 2003 Action Plan to the 2001 - 2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development; and

 WHEREAS, the 2003 Action Plan should be revised to reflect revised program descriptions consistent with the Substitute Funding Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121512, passed June 21, 2004, amended the 2004 Action Plan to the 2001 - 2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development; and

 WHEREAS, the 2004 Action Plan should be revised to reflect revised program descriptions consistent with the Substitute Funding Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121625, passed October 18, 2004, adopted the City's 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development; and

 WHEREAS, the table of activities in the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects should be revised to reflect revised 2005 program descriptions and funding allocations consistent with the Substitute Funding Agreement;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is hereby authorized to enter into a substitute funding agreement (the "Substitute Funding Agreement") with Sound Transit substantially in the form of the agreement attached to this ordinance (Exhibit A), entitled "Substitute Community Development Fund Agreement Executed By Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority and the City Of Seattle To Establish, Oversee, And Fund The City Of Seattle's Portion Of The Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund". The Substitute Funding Agreement provides the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle ("the Fund") with flexibility to support a wider range of business and real estate development projects by substituting Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for the more restricted funds that would have come from Sound Transit under the original agreement. The Substitute Funding Agreement states that the City will make capitalizing the Fund its top priority for CDBG funds after the public services cap is reached. The use of additional City CDBG funds will result in extending the schedule to capitalize the Fund beyond what was contemplated in the 2002 Funding Agreement. In addition, as a consequence of providing this more flexible fund source to the Fund, Seattle's utilities will be reimbursed for all costs created by the Sound Transit project, excluding betterments.

 Section 2. As with the 2002 Funding Agreement, the Substitute Funding Agreement is put in place in recognition of the unique circumstances surrounding Link light rail construction in Southeast Seattle. Neither the creation of the Fund nor the execution of the Substitute Funding Agreement shall establish a precedent for future capital projects in other neighborhoods.

 Section 3. Under contract with Sound Transit, the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund ("the RVCDF") is providing financial and technical support to businesses impacted by light rail construction in accordance with the operating plan ("the Plan") for the Fund adopted by Ordinance 121021. The total amount of funds designated in the Plan for supplemental mitigation activity is $21.5 million. The Substitute Funding Agreement will replace $13.5 million of Sound Transit funds for this purpose with up to $13.5 million in City CDBG funds. City general funds and CDBG funds will be used to meet Seattle's obligation to capitalize the Fund, for the purpose of paying for supplemental mitigation services (as may be provided in the Plan), the associated administrative costs of providing those services, and other CDBG- eligible costs related to the construction of the Central Link Light Rail project, to the extent those funds are appropriated for that use. However, no City CDBG funds shall be spent in relation to the construction of the Central Link Light Rail project unless the City and Sound Transit, with the concurrence of the Federal Transit Administration, have mutually agreed to those expenditures.

 Section 4. The following 2005 budget provisos are modified as shown:

 Department/ Greensheet Proviso BCL Fund

 CDBG #10-1-A-1 "None of the money appropriated Community for 2005 for the Community Development Development Block Grant's Office Block Grant, of Economic Development BCL can Office of be spent on Rainier Valley Economic Community Development Fund Development apprenticeship training programs until authorized by future ordinance."

 Finance #10-1-A-1 "None of the money appropriated Finance General General for 2005 for the Finance General Reserves Reserves BCL for the Sound Transit Local Contribution- Sales Tax Offset can be spent on apprenticeship training programs until authorized by future ordinance."

 Section 5. City general funds and CDBG funds will be used for Plan purposes, including but not limited to apprenticeship preparation to place Rainier Valley residents in construction and construction- related jobs; development or rehabilitation of properties serving as receiving sites for businesses dislocated by light rail construction; and development of an amendment to the Plan that will govern the long term community and transit-oriented development activities of the Fund, to the extent those funds are appropriated for that use.

 Section 6. Nothing in this ordinance is intended to modify the prohibition in Section 3 of Ordinance 120796 on spending City general funds or CDBG funds on transit-oriented or community development activities by the RVCDF until such time as the City Council and Sound Transit approve an amendment to the Plan that details allowable activities. In addition, the Council may, when authorizing expenditures of city general funds or CDBG funds, impose other restrictions that must be satisfied.

 Section 7. The project description of the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (L/M), located on page 20 of 26 of the 2003 Action Plan to the 2001 - 2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, as amended by Ordinance 121256, is amended as shown in Exhibit B to this ordinance. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to make any conforming changes that may be necessary to the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects and other portions of the current Consolidated Plan to reflect the changes adopted in this section.

 Section 8. The project description of the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund - Property Advance Program (L/M), located on page 16 of 21 of the 2004 Action Plan to the 2001 - 2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, as amended by Ordinance 121512, is amended as shown in Exhibit C to this ordinance. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to make any conforming changes that may be necessary to the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects and other portions of the current Consolidated Plan to reflect the changes adopted in this section.

 Section 9. The project description of the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (CDF) - Property Advance Program (L/M), located on page 14 of 18 of the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects, is amended as shown in Exhibit D to this ordinance, superseding the description in the Table of Proposed Projects as adopted by Ordinance 121625. In addition, the funding allocations for the Property Advance Program (L/M) are amended as shown in Exhibit D to this ordinance. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to make any conforming changes that may be necessary to the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects and other portions of the current Consolidated Plan to reflect the changes adopted in this section.

 Section 10. Any acts taken in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance, but prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 11. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 EXHIBIT A: SUBSTITUTE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND AGREEMENT EXECUTED BY CENTRAL PUGET SOUND REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 TO ESTABLISH,OVERSEE, AND FUND THE CITY OF SEATTLE'S PORTION OF THE TRANSIT- ORIENTED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND

 This Substitute Agreement is between the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit") and City of Seattle ("Seattle"). Sound Transit and Seattle agree to establish, oversee, and fund Seattle's portion of the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle (the "Fund"), according to the terms set forth herein.

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit's Board of Directors established the Transit- Oriented Community Development Fund (the "Fund") to increase transit ridership on Central Link light rail ("Link light rail") and to address the impacts of Link light rail construction and operation when it adopted Resolution 99-34 on November 18, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit Resolution 99-34, adopted November 18, 1999, stated "The cost of [the Fund] shall, to the extent possible, be offset by contributions from Seattle and King County to the Central Link light rail project"; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle and King County led efforts to gain Sound Transit approval of a Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund and Seattle will finance the Fund's expenditures to a large extent through this Substitute Agreement which when fully implemented satisfies Seattle's funding commitment of $42.8 million; and

 WHEREAS, the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") required that Sound Transit establish a Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund as a mitigation condition of the FTA's May 2002 Record of Decision on the Central Link light rail Environmental Impact Statement (the "ROD"); and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council unanimously passed ordinance 120796 on April 29, 2002 authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority to establish, oversee, and fund Seattle's portion of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, subsequent to the City Council passage of Ordinance 120796, the Mayor executed an agreement with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority to establish, oversee, and fund Seattle's portion of the Fund (the "2002 Funding Agreement"); and

 WHEREAS, ordinance 121021 passed unanimously by the Seattle City Council on December 9, 2002 and Motion 2002-138 approved by the Sound Transit Board on December 12, 2002 adopting a Plan ("the Plan") to govern the initial activities of the Fund, including supplemental mitigation of impacts to Rainier Valley businesses due to Link light rail construction; apprenticeship preparation for residents of the Rainier Valley; and, preparation of receiving sites for businesses requiring relocation as a result of Link light rail construction; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and Sound Transit have subsequently contracted with the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund ("the RVCDF") to implement the initial Plan and prepare a future amendment to the Plan to govern the community and transit-oriented development activities of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, construction of light rail is now underway, the relocation of impacted businesses is substantially complete, and the RVCDF now projects needing fewer funds for the supplemental mitigation activities of the Fund than originally projected in the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the RVCDF is developing a proposed amendment to the Plan for the transit-oriented and community development activities of the Fund and anticipates forwarding the draft amendment to the City of Seattle and Sound Transit for review and approval in March 2005; and

 WHEREAS, the 2002 Funding Agreement required Seattle to fund $21.3 million for community development activities through CDBG contributions of $13.5 million and General Fund contributions of $7.8 million; and

 WHEREAS, the original funding agreement required Sound Transit to make payments of up to $21.5 million to capitalize the Fund to be offset by equivalent City of Seattle investments in the light rail project; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle has worked aggressively to identify and implement an alternative funding mechanism to fully fund the Community Development Fund in a manner that provides flexibility to meet the needs of the RVCDF and the community; and

 WHEREAS, the Sound Transit funds are well suited to pay for the supplemental mitigation costs of businesses impacted by Link Light Rail construction as set forth in the Plan. However, these Sound Transit funds lack the flexibility for other desired activities consistent with the mission of the RVCDF; and

 WHEREAS, the RVCDF anticipates investing in job creation and business and real estate development in the Rainier Valley as part of the long- term community and transit-oriented development activities of the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds distributed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are a source of funds well suited to develop real estate, invest in businesses, and create jobs in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods like the Rainier Valley; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle, in its role of being a recipient of CDBG funds, has determined that CDBG funds can appropriately be used for purposes included in the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the RVCDF qualifies under HUD regulations as a "Community Based Development Organization" and is operating within a HUD approved "Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area" for the Rainier Valley; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's variety of funding sources provide flexibility to achieve the goals and objectives of the RVCDF; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's commitment to implement this new CDBG based strategy to fully fund the Fund is confirmed with this substitute agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the recently adopted 2005-2006 City budget includes more than $8 million to fund the Fund, and when added to previous allocations results in a total of approximately $13 million appropriated to date;

 NOW THEREFORE, Seattle and Sound Transit hereby enter into this Substitute Agreement to replace the 2002 Funding Agreement and to establish, oversee and fund Seattle's portion of the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle.

 SUBSTITUTE AGREEMENT

 1. Recitals and Effect. The recitals set forth above are incorporated in this Substitute Agreement. This Substitute Agreement replaces the 2002 Funding Agreement in its entirety and the parties are hereby released from all obligations under that agreement.

 2. Establishment of Fund. The parties have established a Community Development Fund as set forth in the original Agreement. The purposes of the Fund are to increase transit ridership within the geographic boundaries of the Fund, address the impacts of Link light rail construction and operation, and invest in physical and economic improvements in Southeast Seattle.

 3. Operating Plan Amendment. Sound Transit's Board and the Seattle City Council have received and approved the current Plan. As set forth in Seattle Ordinance 121021 and Sound Transit Motion 2002-138, the RVCDF may expend funds only on the supplemental mitigation activities detailed in the Plan until such time as Sound Transit's Board and the City Council have received and approved an amendment to the Plan to govern the future community development activities of the Fund. Expenditures on apprenticeship preparation, receiving site development for businesses dislocated by construction of Link light rail, and preparation of the amendment to the Plan are the only exceptions to this restriction.

 4 Funding. Seattle shall provide $42.8 million of the $50 million necessary to fully fund the Fund, subject to lesser payments under Section 4.3.1. Sound Transit shall provide the remaining $7.2 million in funding required through support received from King County and has provided this funding amount in total. The amounts and conditions of this funding support are set forth below.

 4.1 Non-Exclusive Transit Way Agreement. As a result of the parties having increased the flexibility of the Fund by Seattle's agreement to commit CDBG funds over an extended period, Sound Transit's obligation to reimburse Seattle's utilities for costs related to Sound Transit construction is fully reinstated. Sound Transit therefore remains obligated under Subsection 3.5 of the Non-Exclusive Transit Way Agreement for all project-related costs (excluding betterments) related to utilities owned by Seattle.

 4.2 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Payments to the Fund. As a replacement for Link project contributions of $21.5 million and the continued commitment of $13.5 million in CDBG funding included in the 2002 agreement, Seattle shall pay a total of $35 million in Community Development Block Grant funds, subject to all applicable federal regulations and eligibility standards, for activities approved by Seattle and Sound Transit in the Plan and any future amendment to the Plan. Seattle will make capitalizing the Fund its top priority for Seattle's annual CDBG allocation, after the public services cap (approximately 35% of the annual CDBG entitlement). However, should the City be prevented from obtaining such federal funding, Seattle shall aggressively pursue and be responsible for developing an alternative funding mechanism to fully capitalize the Fund. Consistent with the 2002 Funding Agreement, Seattle is expressly committed to providing $21.3 million dollars for community development purposes through CDBG funding of $13.5 million and $7.8 million of General Fund contribution except as provided for in section 4.3.1. Seattle is also expressly committed to funding $7.2 million dollars for transit oriented development related to the purposes of the King County contribution through CDBG funding or other funding as necessary for a total of $28.5 million.

 4.2.1 Transit Oriented Development Funding. Over the course of this funding period, at least $7.2 million of Seattle's CDBG funds, or other City funds as necessary, shall be specifically committed to projects that support and promote transit use in a manner consistent with the attached guidelines for qualifying transit-oriented development projects (Attachment A).

 4.2.2 Supplemental Mitigation Funding. Up to $14.3 million of the CDBG funds may be made available for the purposes of paying for: (1) supplemental mitigation services (as may be provided in the Plan), (2) the associated administrative costs of providing those services, and (3) other CDBG-eligible costs related to the construction of the Central Link Light Rail project. The City and Sound Transit, with the concurrence of the Federal Transit Administration, shall mutually agree to any CDBG expenditure related to the construction of the Central Link Light Rail project. Through November 30, 2004, Sound Transit has funded $7.2 million using funds that it received from King County.

 4.2.3 CDBG Payment Schedule. Seattle has made initial CDBG payments to the Fund in 2003 and 2004 and shall continue to make annual payments, according to the following schedule.

 Year City Payment 2003 $1,900,000 2004 $2,400,000 2005 $2,500,000 2006 $2,500,000 2007 $4,350,000 2008 $4,330,000 2009 $4,330,000 2010 $4,230,000 2011 $4,230,000 2012 $4,230,000 Total $35,000,000

 4.3 Use of Sales Tax Receipts Due to Link Light Rail Construction. Seattle shall also make payments to the Fund in a total amount of up to $7.8 million in addition to the payments described in Section 4.2.3. The following table shows actual payments made to the Fund in 2003 and 2004 and the estimated schedule for these payments from 2005 to 2009. The schedule is based on the estimated annual retail sales and use tax revenue that Seattle will receive due to taxable sales in Seattle for Link light rail construction. This estimated schedule for payments is based on the attached Sound Transit construction schedule (Exhibit B).

 Year Estimated City Payment 2003 $60,000 2004 $620,000 2005 $1,630,000 2006 $1,500,000 2007 $1,700,000

 2008 $1,300,000 2009 990,000 Total Estimated City Payments $7,800,000

 4.3.1 Revisions to Payment Schedule of Estimated Sales Tax Receipts. The estimated annual amounts shown in the table in Section 4.3 are subject to change due to revisions to Sound Transit's construction schedule. Not later than January 31 of each year, Sound Transit will submit to Seattle an updated schedule showing anticipated construction for Central Link light rail by calendar year for the remainder of the project and completed construction for the previous year. The amount that Seattle shall pay in the then-current year shall equal the estimated retail sales and use tax revenue that Seattle will receive in that year due to taxable sales in Seattle for Central Link light rail, plus or minus any adjustment to reconcile the revised estimate of the previous year's sales tax revenue compared to the original estimate of the previous year's payments. Seattle shall be responsible for calculating any adjustments. Notwithstanding any adjustments to the estimated schedule for payments shown in the table in Section 4.3, the total amount that Seattle shall pay under Section 4.3 shall be the total amount of sales and use tax revenue that Seattle receives due to taxable sales in Seattle for Central Link light rail, estimated when the project has been completed, up to a maximum of $7.8 million.

 Should the sales tax revenue not reach the maximum of $7.8 million, Sound Transit shall be obligated to make up the difference between those lower revenues and $7.8 million. Sound Transit shall fulfill this obligation no later than December 2009. Sound Transit payments made under this section, if any, shall be used to promote transit ridership in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and regulations governing the use of Sound Transit funds and the guidelines attached to this Substitute Agreement (Exhibit A) and in manner permitted by the Plan or any future amendment to the Plan approved by Sound Transit and Seattle.

 4.4 Payment Cap. Notwithstanding any other term of this Substitute Agreement, the total amount to be paid by Seattle to the Fund shall not exceed $42.8 million.

 4.5 Sound Transit Funding. Sound Transit has paid a total of $7.2 million into the Fund for the purpose of funding the supplemental mitigation program described in the Plan.

 4.5.1 Use of Excess; Repaid Monies in the Fund. In the event a portion of the Sound Transit payments made to the Fund remain after the supplemental mitigation purposes of the Plan have been met, or in the event a portion of the Sound Transit funds distributed from the Fund as "advances" has been repaid, the funds shall remain in the Fund and be used within its geographic boundaries. These funds shall be used to promote transit ridership in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and regulations governing the use of Sound Transit funds and the guidelines attached to this Substitute Agreement (Exhibit A) and in a manner permitted by the Plan or any future amendment to the Plan approved by Sound Transit and Seattle.

 4.6 Ongoing Conditions to Funding. Notwithstanding anything in this Substitute Agreement to the contrary, the parties shall have the right to discontinue making further payments required to be made under this Substitute Agreement into the Fund and to the Link Light Rail project under the circumstances described below. Neither party shall exercise this right without first consulting with the other through the dispute resolution process outlined in Section 7 below and attempting to reach satisfactory resolution through that process.

 4.7 Cessation of Seattle Payments. The parties acknowledge that each has a role in the implementation of Link light rail within Seattle, and agree to exercise best efforts to facilitate the timely implementation of the project. Notwithstanding such best efforts, and taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, if Sound Transit does not diligently construct Link Light Rail, as approved by the Sound Transit Board in Resolution 2001-16 on November 29, 2001, in a timely and fiscally responsible manner, Seattle may cease further payments. Seattle may exercise this right only through a resolution adopted by the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, or by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.

 4.8 Reciprocal Rights. If a party fails for any reason (including, but not limited to, insolvency, injunction, or exercise of a right or remedy under this Substitute Agreement, including the exercise of the right to cease payment under Section 4.7 or as a result of an uncontrollable event described in Section 10) to make the payments and contributions under this Substitute Agreement, then in addition to its legal remedies, the other party may cease further payments.

 5 Oversight of the Fund. The parties shall share oversight responsibilities for the Fund as follows: Seattle shall oversee the Fund, its administration and expenditures. Sound Transit shall provide review and oversight of program actions undertaken as part of the supplemental mitigation program authorized in the Plan. Sound Transit's responsibility shall remain in effect until Seattle and Sound Transit, by mutual consent of the representatives designated in Section 7.1 of this Substitute Agreement, determine that the supplemental mitigation activities of the Fund are substantially complete and adequate oversight provisions have been established for any remaining Sound Transit funds (i.e., those deposited pursuant to Section 4.3.1, if any, and those described in Section 4.5.1).

 5.1 Oversight Objectives and Requirements. The parties shall oversee the Fund such that the objectives set forth in this Section 5.1 are achieved and may enter into such contracts or agreements with one another and with third parties and with alternate administration entities as may be necessary to do so.

 5.1.1 Administration and Recordkeeping. The Fund shall be administered in a professional manner by qualified personnel, consistent with this Substitute Agreement and with the Plan. The administrator(s) of the Fund shall maintain records that are adequate to fully document Fund finances, including all funds received, income, investments, and expenditures, and the reasons for all expenditures. Records shall be maintained in a manner and duration necessary to satisfy both parties' record retention needs.

 MEMORANDUM

 TO: Rainier Valley Community Development Fund

 FROM: Jon Layzer, Sound Transit Program Manager Seattle Department of Transportation

 David Hopkins, Regional Transit Manager King County Executive's Office

 Ron Lewis, Link Deputy Director Sound Transit Link Light Rail

 DATE: June 8, 2004

 SUBJECT: Guidelines for Transit Oriented Development

 As the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (RVCDF) develops its financial products for the amended Operating Plan, the City of Seattle, King County and Sound Transit wanted to provide a suggested definition of the term "transit oriented development" (TOD) appropriate for Southeast Seattle. The definition and accompanying analysis below were agreed upon by all three jurisdictions. We believe this definition will provide greater clarity on the meaning of TOD as well as provide considerable flexibility in developing RVCDF's financial products.

 Transit Oriented Development

 Definition: Public or private development that supports and promotes transit use. Development projects should strive to enhance the effectiveness of transit, and be related physically or functionally to transit.

 To be considered TOD, development should address all three key components: location, use and design.

 * Location - Development that occurs within walking distance of major transit service. Generally, this means development occurring within 1/4 mile of any light rail station, or 1/4 mile of any bus stop with multiple routes and/or frequent service.

 [For example, under this definition, development occurring within 1/4 mile of the MLK corridor and 1/4 mile of the Rainier Ave corridor in Southeast Seattle would satisfy the location component.]

 * Land Use - Types of development that support and promote transit ridership. Development that creates housing, jobs, shopping, community services or recreational opportunities could qualify as acceptable use. Development should maximize transit use by making the best use of the underlying zoning capacity to encourage moderate or high-density development clustered near transit. Development should encourage a mix of uses where provided by underlying zoning.

 [An example of appropriate land use for a development adjacent to transit on a busy commercial street would be a 5-story mixed-use building with street-front retail and housing above.]

 * Design - Development design that encourages neighborhood and pedestrian activity on the street and connectivity to transit, and decreased dependence on driving. The development should enhance the environment for pedestrians in terms of safety, comfort and visual appeal. Inviting sidewalks and pedestrian public spaces are examples of appropriate design. Developments should encourage reduced parking and creative transportation demand management solutions to emphasize transit-use.
