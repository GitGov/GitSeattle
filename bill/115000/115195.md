 AN ORDINANCE transferring jurisdiction of the surplus California substation property from Seattle City Light to the Department of Parks and Recreation for open space, park, and recreation purposes; and making an appropriation from the 2000 Parks Levy Fund for costs and expenses related to the transfer, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light (hereafter "City Light") acquired the California substation property (hereafter "Substation Property") for electric utility purposes, but the substation has become obsolete and the Substation Property is no longer useful to City Light; and

 WHEREAS, the 2000 Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy (hereafter "2000 Parks Levy"), as proposed by Ordinance 120024 and approved by Seattle voters on November 7, 2000, provides funds for acquisition of new neighborhood parks and green spaces; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 identified the Substation Property for acquisition with 2000 Parks Levy funding in the Neighborhood Park Acquisition subcategory; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent of City Light and the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation have agreed to transfer jurisdiction of the Substation Property from City Light to the Department of Parks and Recreation (hereafter "Parks") subject to certain conditions; and

 WHEREAS, City Light and Parks have determined the fair market value of the Substation Property by real estate appraisal, which assumes there are no Hazardous Substances (as hereinafter defined) in or on the Substation Property that would affect the value of the Substation Property; and

 WHEREAS, Hazardous Substances were discovered on the Substation Property; and

 WHEREAS, on July 27, 2004, City Light and Parks entered into an interdepartmental agreement ("Memorandum of Understanding") a copy of which is attached as Attachment 1, providing for Parks to expend funds to clean up the Hazardous Substances with City Light oversight and to deduct the final cost of clean up from the fair market value of the Substation Property; and

 WHEREAS, for purposes of this Ordinance, the term Hazardous Substance or Hazardous Substances means any substance or material defined or designated as hazardous, dangerous, radioactive or toxic material, waste or substance, environmental pollutant or contaminant, including petroleum products, or other similar term by any federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance now in effect or subsequently enacted, and the term Environmental Laws means any environmental or health and safety-related regulation, rule, ordinance or directive at the federal, state, or local level, whether existing as of the date of this Ordinance, previously enforced or subsequently enacted; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Attachment 1 to DPR California Substation Ordinance

 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

 Between

 Seattle City Light and the Parks and Recreation Department

 Seattle City Light (SCL) authorizes the Parks and Recreation Department (Parks) to remediate the contamination at the California Substation site (4304 SW Dakota St.). This remediation will be conducted according to the scope of work approved by SCL with corrections dated April 19, 2004. The project cost is expected to total $424,772.60. SCL will bear responsibility for actual costs incurred. However, when or if remediation efforts reach $575,000.00, via high bids or change orders, SCL and Parks will discuss a possible revised approach (within 48 hours) prior to additional cost being incurred. Actual costs expended by Parks for remediation will be reimbursed by SCL or deducted from the fair market value of $710,000. Parks Department will pay SCL the balance of the fair market value (minus the remediation deduction) after the 30-day effective date of the ordinance transferring jurisdiction of the property from SCL to Parks. Parks will prepare such ordinance after the completion of the remediation project.

 Parks Department will carry out this remediation under the following conditions:

 * SCL environmental staff will review submitted bids prior to selection.

 * SCL environmental staff will be consulted on the contractor selection process.

 * SCL is allowed to have representatives on-site at any time during the project to observe work.

 * All waste disposal sites must be pre-approved by SCL environmental staff.

 * SCL will be consulted prior to issuance of any change orders that would significantly increase the cost of the project.

 * SCL will be provided copies of all regulatory documents such as waste manifests, laboratory reports, and certificates of disposal.
