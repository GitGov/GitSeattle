 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the franchise granted to Seattle Steam Limited Partnership; amending Ordinance 121067 to replace the term "steam power" with "thermal energy" to reflect industry terminology, and to permit the use of an existing tunnel under Western Avenue between Union and University Streets for franchise purposes.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121067 authorizes Seattle Steam Limited Partnership permission to place pipes, conduits and other necessary appurtenances in and along certain streets, avenues, alleys and public places for a period of fifty years beginning March, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121067 refers to the purpose of these pipes, conduits and appurtenances for heating purposes and steam power; and

 WHEREAS, the pipes, conduits and appurtenances utilized under permission of Ordinance 121067 may be hot or cold water pipes for the purpose of heating, cooling or condensation, and, thus, the terms "steam" and "steam power" are not a wholly accurate reflection of their use; and

 WHEREAS, the industry term "thermal energy" is the commonly-accepted industry term for this product referenced as "steam power" in Ordinance 121067; and

 WHEREAS, since the early 1900's Seattle Steam Limited Partnership has made use of an existing tunnel located under Western Avenue between University and Union Streets, but said tunnel was inadvertently not included in the original franchise agreement ordinance; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
