 WHEREAS, the Seattle Municipal Code currently provides that the heads of five departments (Seattle City Light, the Department of Neighborhoods, the Department of Planning and Development, Seattle Public Utilities, and the Seattle Department of Transportation) are appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council, and subject to reappointment and reconfirmation every four years; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30894 would place a proposed ballot measure before the voters of Seattle to amend the City Charter to provide for reappointment and reconfirmation every four years for certain other department heads who are provided for in the Charter (Department of Finance, Department of Parks and Recreation, and Personnel Department); and
