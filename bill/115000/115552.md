 AN ORDINANCE relating to South Lake Union Park; authorizing amendments to the Agreement between the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Parks Foundation.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121963 authorized the execution of an Agreement (the "Agreement) between the Seattle Parks Foundation (Foundation) and the City of Seattle, delineating each party's roles and responsibilities relative to the design, development, and construction of SLU Park; and

 WHEREAS, the Agreement provides that the construction of the SLU Park will be undertaken in two phases, the first to begin as soon as possible with funds already identified, and the second to begin after the Foundation has raised the $10,000,000 stipulated in its Agreement with the City; and

 WHEREAS, after the SLU Park had been designed and its budget adopted, the City determined that the bulkhead was vulnerable and there were three options to deal with the situation: (1) build the SLU Park using the existing bulkhead, postponing its replacement until sometime in the future when it would inevitably fail; (2) cut back the SLU Park by 8,000 square feet, eliminating the ability to moor large ships along the bulkhead and reducing the length of the boardwalk; or (3) replace the bulkhead now rather than later; and

 WHEREAS, the Project Review Committee, consisting of City Investors, the Foundation, the Center for Wooden Boats, and City representatives, determined that the most cost effective, long-term solution dictates that the bulkhead be replaced before the park is built, thereby avoiding the disruption and higher cost of later replacement once the park is completed and in full usage; and

 WHEREAS, the Foundation and the City of Seattle desire to maintain the size of the overall park land as reflected in the original project plan and keep the bulkhead at its original length; and

 WHEREAS, the SLU Park Development Project cost has increased by $4,228,000, comprised of the bulkhead replacement and related site work and redesign, which had not been anticipated in the original park design, scope, and approved budget, as well as permit-related design costs for both phases of the Project, which had not been anticipated in the Phase 1 portion of the approved budget; and

 WHEREAS, between 1984 and 2003, the City has invested approximately $17.5 million in the purchase and interim development of SLU Park and allocated another $5 million in 2000 Parks Levy funds toward the planning, design, and development of the Park; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends that no additional City funds will be appropriated to achieve the SLU Park Improvement Plan if private fundraising does not meet its goals, aside from the provisions relating to possible failure to satisfy conditions on the availability of the City Investor's additional $5 million in funding for Phase 2 as contained in Section 3.4 of the Agreement with the Foundation as adopted in Ordinance 121963; and

 WHEREAS, the Foundation is agreeable to applying unused project contingency funds to help offset the increased cost of bulkhead replacement if any remains following project close-out upon completion of Phase II of the SLU Park construction; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, or his designee, is authorized to execute amendments to the Agreement with the Seattle Parks Foundation authorized by Ordinance 121963, as shown in Attachment A, to this ordinance.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority granted by and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Attachment A: Seattle Parks Foundation Agreement Amendments

 The Parties mutually agree to amend the Agreement between the City of Seattle and the Seattle Parks Foundation, which was authorized by Ordinance 121963, as follows:

 1. Section 1 Definitions, 1.1

 1.1 "Approved Budget" means the budget for the construction of the South Lake Union Park, including both Construction Phase 1 and Construction Phase 2, substantially in the form of the working budget attached as Exhibit A. At the time of bidding of each Phase, the Approved Budget for that Phase shall include a reasonable construction contingency as determined by the City's Finance Director.

 2. Section 3.5

 3.5 Project Procurement Process. The Foundation shall review the construction documents for the Park to ensure consistency with the Approved Design. The City will solicit bids or proposals for the construction of each of the two construction phases, consistent with the Approved Design as provided herein. Bids or proposals received will be evaluated for consistency with the construction budget within the Approved Budget. In the event the lowest responsive bid or otherwise preferred proposal from a responsible bidder exceeds the construction budget within the Approved Budget, the Project Review Committee will evaluate the bid or proposal and, if possible, recommend to the Parties changes in the Approved Design or Approved Budget to allow acceptance of the bid or proposal. Acceptance of the bid or proposal will be conditioned on the Parties approval of a revised Approved Budget or revised Approved Design or both. If the Parties are unable to identify and approve a combination of changes in the Approved Design and Approved Budget sufficient to enable acceptance of the bid or proposal, all bids or proposals will be rejected and the Project Review Committee will work to identify and recommend to the Parties a strategy for proceeding with the Park, which may include cutting the scope of the Approved Design, and/or adding resources to the Approved Budget. The Parties recognize that the City is bound by the public works laws of the state, and that the City may be required to rebid the construction of a construction phase (which may result in delay in the start of construction) if substantial changes are made to the scope of the Approved Design and the construction contract being bid. In the event that the City is able to enter into a construction contract(s) for Phase 2 that is less than the construction budget in the Approved Budget for Phase 2, the difference shall be added to the construction contingency for Phase 2. Any cost savings realized during construction shall also be added to the construction contingency for Phase 2. In the event that the City is able to complete construction of the Park consistent with the Approved Design and within the Approved Budget, any funds remaining in the contingency (following project close-out upon completion of Phase 2) shall be deposited into the City's general fund in recognition that the City provided funding to cover the increased cost of bulkhead replacement in Phase 1.~~the Foundation's obligation under this Agreement to provide funds for Park construction will be reduced by the amount of budgeted funds remaining following project closeout. However, the Foundation agrees to reserve the balance of the $10 million of funds it has raised for Park construction for future capital improvements in the Park.~~

 3. Section 3.7

 3.7 Changes in Approved Design. Any material change to the Approved Design through completion of Construction Phase 2 requires the approval of the Superintendent and the Foundation. A material change includes any substantial departure from the Approved Design including but not limited to elimination or addition of a significant element or feature; discernible or functional alteration in the quality or projected performance of any significant feature or system; or any significant change in the use or appearance of any major space or component. Either the City or the Foundation may propose a material change. Any material change that represents an increase in the cost of the Park will be accompanied by a recommendation for funding it. Any proposal for a material change and the recommendation for funding it will be evaluated by the Project Review Committee. In approving any such proposed change, the Parties may agree to apply construction contingency funds available within the Approved Budget~~;~~or apply offsetting savings from other mutually agreeable changes. The Superintendent (with Council approval) and the Foundation may~~; or~~ commit additional funds to supplement the Approved Budget.

 4. Exhibit A, South Lake Union Park Development Budget is replaced with Exhibit 1, Revised South Lake Union Park Development Budget, attached hereto.
