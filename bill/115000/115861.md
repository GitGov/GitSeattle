 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle's Complete Streets policy, stating guiding principles and practices so that transportation improvements are planned, designed and constructed to encourage walking, bicycling and transit use while promoting safe operations for all users.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, adopted Resolution 30915 that defines the Complete Streets policy; and

 WHEREAS, City policy as stated in the Transportation Strategic Plan and the Seattle Comprehensive Plan is to encourage walking, bicycling and transit use as safe, convenient and widely available modes of transportation for all people; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's Complete Streets guiding principle is to design, operate and maintain Seattle's streets to promote safe and convenient access and travel for all users --- pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and people of all abilities, as well as freight and motor vehicle drivers; and

 WHEREAS, other jurisdictions and agencies nationwide have adopted Complete Streets legislation including the U.S. Department of Transportation, numerous state transportation agencies, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, Boulder, Chicago and Portland; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) will implement Complete Streets policy by designing, operating and maintaining the transportation network to improve travel conditions for bicyclists, pedestrians, transit and freight in a manner consistent with, and supportive of, the surrounding community; and

 WHEREAS, transportation improvements will include an array of facilities and amenities that are recognized as contributing to Complete Streets, including: street and sidewalk lighting; pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements; access improvements for freight; access improvements, including compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act; public transit facilities accommodation including, but not limited, to pedestrian access improvement to transit stops and stations; street trees and landscaping; drainage; and street amenities; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT will implement policies and procedures with the construction, reconstruction or other changes of transportation facilities on arterial streets to support the creation of Complete Streets including capital improvements, re-channelization projects and major

 maintenance, recognizing that all streets are different and in each case user needs must be balanced; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. SDOT will plan for, design and construct all new City transportation improvement projects to provide appropriate accommodation for pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and persons of all abilities, while promoting safe operation for all users, as provided for below.

 Section 2. SDOT will incorporate Complete Streets principles into: the Department's Transportation Strategic Plan; Seattle Transit Plan; Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plans; Intelligent Transportation System Strategic Plan; and other SDOT plans, manuals, rules, regulations and programs as appropriate.

 Section 3. Because freight is important to the basic economy of the City and has unique right-of-way needs to support that role, freight will be the major priority on streets classified as Major Truck Streets. Complete Street improvements that are consistent with freight mobility but also support other modes may be considered on these streets.

 Section 4. Except in unusual or extraordinary circumstances, Complete Streets principles will not apply:

 * to repairs made pursuant to the Pavement Opening and Restoration Rule (SDOT Director's Rule 2004-02);

 * to ordinary maintenance activities designed to keep assets in serviceable condition (e.g., mowing, cleaning, sweeping, spot repair and surface treatments such as chip seal, or interim measures on detour or haul routes);

 * where the Director of Transportation issues a documented exception concluding that application of Complete Street principles is unnecessary or inappropriate because it would be contrary to public safety; or

 * where other available means or factors indicate an absence of need, including future need.

 Section 5. Complete Streets may be achieved through single projects or incrementally through a series of smaller improvements or maintenance activities over time. It is the Mayor's and Council's intent that all sources of transportation funding be drawn upon to implement Complete Streets. The City believes that maximum financial flexibility is important to implement Complete Streets principles.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
