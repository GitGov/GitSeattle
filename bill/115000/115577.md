It is unlawful for any person to engage in or to cause any work subject to the order to be done until authorization from the Director is received.

 6.430.260 Notice of violation.

 A. Notice. If, after investigation, the Director of the Health Department determines that there has been a violation of this code not resulting in revocation of a license, the Director may serve a notice of violation upon the person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation may state the requirements violated, what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the responsible person by regular first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person. The notice of violation shall be considered an Order of the Director.

 B. Other remedies. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Section 6.430.250 of this code, and nothing in this section shall be deemed to obligate or require the Director to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

 C. Review by the Director. Any person affected by a notice of violation issued by the Director of the Health Department pursuant to this chapter may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review in writing within ten days after service of the notice. Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, on the date of mailing.

 The Director shall issue an order within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the review. The Director shall mail the order by regular first class mail to the person or persons named in the notice of violation.

 6.430.270 Penalties.

 A. Civil Penalties. Any failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the Director has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.

 B. Alternative Criminal Penalty. Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director my request the City Attorney to prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil procedure outlined in this chapter.

 6.430.280 Additional relief.

 The Director may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition which constitutes a violation of this chapter when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance.
