 AN ORDINANCE relating to taximeter rates; increasing the meter rates for taxicabs licensed to operate in Seattle; increasing the flat rate from downtown to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport; modifying the method by which a temporary fuel surcharge is authorized; and amending Section 6.310.530 of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the current taximeter rates became effective on January 1, 1997 and since that time the Consumer Price Index has risen approximately 18% in the Seattle metropolitan area, making it appropriate to adjust rates to reflect inflationary cost increases; and

 WHEREAS, to ensure that the temporary fuel surcharge provided for by Ordinance 121131 achieves its intended goal with a minimum of confusion and inconvenience for the taxicab industry and for passengers, it is necessary to revise the method by which the Director of Executive Administration implements such surcharges; and

 WHEREAS, all cost items should continue to be considered in setting taximeter rates, and redundancies in the language of Section 6.310.530 B5 of the Seattle Municipal Code with respect to such cost items should be eliminated; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 6.310.530 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 6.310.530 Rates.

 A. The rates for taxicabs licensed to operate in Seattle shall be established by the Seattle City Council.

 B. In reviewing rates the Council may take into account, among other things, and with the objective of prescribing a just and reasonable rate, the following factors:

 1. The information in a report prepared by the Director pursuant to SMC Section 6.310.520;

 2. The public's need for adequate taxi service at the lowest level of charges consistent with the provision, maintenance and continuation of such service;

 3. The rates of other licensees operating in similar areas;

 4. The effect of such rates upon transportation of passengers by other modes of transportation;

 5. The owners' need for revenue of a level that, under honest, efficient and economical management, is sufficient to cover ~~the~~all costs (including all operating expenses, ~~depreciation accruals, rents,~~and license fees ~~and~~~~taxes of every kind~~ of providing adequate taxi service, plus ~~an amount equal to such percentage of the cost as is reasonably necessary for the replacement of deteriorated taxicabs and~~ a reasonable profit to the owner; and

 6. Consistency of rates with those charged by King County.

 C. No taxicab shall have more than one (1) rate on its meter.

 D. Except for special or contract rates as provided for in this chapter, or any per trip fee established by the Port of Seattle and set forth in any operating agreement or tariff, or an airport flat rate defined in this section, or a temporary fuel surcharge authorized by the Director pursuant to subsection I of this section, it shall be unlawful for anyone operating a taxicab licensed by The City of Seattle to advertise, charge, demand or receive any greater or lesser rate than the following:

 Meter rate:

 1. Drop charge: for passengers for first ~~1/9~~1/10 mile.... ~~$1.80~~$2.50

 2. Per mile: For each ~~1/9~~1/10 mile or fraction thereof after the first ~~1/9~~1/10 mile.... $ .20

 3. For every one (1) minute of waiting time....$ .50*

 4. ~~Extra charge for passengers over~~Additional per passenger charge for more than two (2) persons, excluding children under twelve (12) years of age.... $ .50

 * Waiting time rates are charged when taxicab speed is less than ~~seventeen (17)~~fifteen (15) miles per hour or when a taxicab driver is asked to wait for the customer.

 E. Special Rates, Contract Rates, "Downtown to Airport" Flat Rate, and Coupons.

 1. Special rates as defined in this chapter shall be calculated as a fraction or percentage of the meter rate.

 2. The special rates must be filed with the Director on forms furnished by the Director.

 3. All special rates and/or contract rates shall be filed once a year at the time of application by the taxicab association representative, or by the owner of a for-hire vehicle which is not a taxicab.

 4. Licensees may change the special rates filed no more than once a year.

 5. Contract rates set during the license year shall be filed within two (2) weeks of securing such contract and before implementing the contract rate.

 6. All taxicabs shall charge a flat rate of Twenty-~~five~~ eight Dollars ~~$25~~($28) from the downtown hotel district to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport except when contract rates are in effect for the trip, or when the Director has temporarily suspended the flat rate in accordance with subsection J of this section. The downtown hotel district is the area defined by Broad Street to Mercer Street to I-5 on the north, Elliot Bay on the west, South Dearborn Street on the south, and Boren Ave. to the I-5 Freeway and then the Freeway on the east.

 7. The use of coupons to establish a lower rate, or a rate not provided within this section, is prohibited.

 F. For-hire Vehicle Rates.

 1. Every for-hire vehicle licensee shall file all rates and charges with the ~~d~~Director. All rates and charges, including any adopted senior citizen discount rate, shall be conspicuously displayed in the interior of the for-hire vehicle so as to be readily discernible to the passenger. The Director will prescribe the manner of such posting.

 2. For-hire vehicles must charge for service based on a written contract, flat charge per trip, by zone, or by an hourly rate with minimum increments of one-half ( 1/2) hour.

 G. The rates specified in this section shall not apply to transportation of persons provided pursuant to a written contract which establishes a fare at a different rate for specified transportation and has been previously filed with the Director; provided, that no contract may include any provision the effect of which is to directly or indirectly require exclusive use of the transportation services of the contracting taxicab or for-hire vehicle.

 H. It is unlawful under the Americans with Disabilities Act to charge a special service vehicle rate which is different from the taxicab rates adopted in subsection D of this section, except in those instances where the transportation of disabled persons is pursuant to a written contract as specified in subsection G of this section (Class B).

 I. The Director is authorized to approve a temporary fuel surcharge to be added to the taxicab meter rate, or the flat rate for trips from the downtown hotel district to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, any time the price of fuel, as published by the American Automobile Association, exceeds ~~by twenty (20) percent the average cost of fuel in the Seattle metropolitan area in the preceding year as published by the American Automobile Association~~ a fuel surcharge trigger price established pursuant to an administrative rule adopted by the Director. The surcharge shall be an amount necessary to recoup the increased fuel costs.

 J. The Director is authorized to temporarily suspend the flat rate from the downtown hotel district to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when conditions exist at the airport or elsewhere that result in an average increase of ten (10) minutes to the normal trip time and are beyond the control of the drivers. Examples of such conditions would be vehicle security checks at the airport or major construction projects on Interstate 5 or State Route 99 that delay traffic.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
