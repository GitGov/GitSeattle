 PROMOTIONAL & MARKETING FEE WAIVERS & REDUCTIONS

 The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation is authorized, as provided in SMC 18.28.020, to waive or reduce entry or use fees from those contained in an approved fee schedule in conjunction with the promotion and marketing of Park and Recreation programs.

 EXAMPLES OF FEE WAIVERS & REDUCTIONS

 Authorized activities include, but are not limited to, the following arrangements:

 1. Sponsored days: A sponsored day or activity for which a sponsor pays the Department a fixed fee, a matching amount, or supplies advertising, service, or other benefit. In exchange, the Department provides free public entry use of the facility, or free or reduced entry for a certain segment of the public (e.g., children under 12, senior citizens, anyone donating clothing or food for a drive for those in need); for a special group of the public (e.g., participants in a community parade); or to the first entrants up to a specified number.

 2. Bonus and prizes: The Department may distribute to users or entrants an item supplied by the sponsor (e.g., a button, a balloon, literature, an item of apparel, or a donated prize for an achievement).

 3. Combination tickets: The Superintendent may issue a combination ticket for use of multiple City facilities or participation in multiple City events. A combination ticket may also take the form of a reciprocal discount or credit. For example, presentation of a ticket stub or coupon from an aquarium in another city may entitle the holder to a credit on admission to the Seattle Aquarium when a receipt for paid entry to Seattle's Aquarium entitles the holder to like privileges in the facility of the other city. In those cases where a combination ticket is authorized, combining multiple events and facilities:

 o The combined ticket price may be less than the amount that would be paid for each entry or event singly; o The combined ticket shall expire within a time period after the ticket's sale or first usage, with said period to be determined by the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation or his or her designee; and

 o The City and any other participant organizations shall apportion the revenue from the combined sale by a ratio or formula.

 4. Discount Coupons: A coupon allowing two people to enter for the price of one person, or the coupon holder to enter at a reduced rate. Coupons may be offered through a sponsor who makes a payment to the City or who provides special advertising in return. For example, the coupon may accompany an advertisement in a widely distributed publication for tourists, which contains similar coupons for other attractions. The Department may also use coupons as a way of reaching out to a group or segment of the citizenry, who would not attend or use the facility at the established fee.

 5. Prepaid Passes: During special hours or otherwise, admission may be sold to a tour company, the organizer of a convention, or an association at an aggregate fee for all members and the participants may be granted entry, either as a group or individually, at the hours or on the days authorized by presenting a ticket or other indication of pre-payment.

 6. Departmental Free or Half-Price Days: "Senior citizens' days" may be offered during which time people over a minimum age are admitted free; a free day may be provided for the public to see and enjoy an exhibit financed through a bond issue or by a public fund-raising drive; on a "Kids' Day" or "Neighborhood Day," admission may be free for children and low income adults; a free golf lesson day for kids may be provided; or free swimming day at our pools may be provided.

 7. Promotional Purposes: The Department may offer extended evening hours or special discounts during specific periods in the year to encourage high attendance at our park facilities. Some examples include, but are not limited to, the following:

 Extended Aquarium hours and special discounts during the summer.

 Extended special discount for swimming fees during the summer.

Unauthorized use of park property, including failure to apply for and obtain a Revocable Use Permit, is unlawful and subject to enforcement actions or other remedies as specified in SMC 18.30 or other applicable law.

 In accordance with the Policy on Non-Park Uses of Park Lands, as endorsed by City Council Resolution 29475, it is the policy of the Department of Parks and Recreation to limit authorized non-park uses of park land to the fullest extent practicable. Fees and conditions set for Revocable Use Permits are intended to discourage private, non-park uses of park lands; encourage the elimination of encroachments; and promote private and public cooperation in maintenance of park lands in a manner consistent with a public park-like character.

 Consideration of any permit application requires payment of an Application Fee, unless City action to a public right-of-way resulted in inaccessibility from other than park property. The Application Fee is non-refundable. Issuance of a permit requires payment of a Permit Fee which is:

 o a fixed daily fee (i.e., Limited Term permit fee); and/or

 o calculated in accordance with a formula (Continuing Use permit fee); or

 o a minimum Permit Fee.

 Application Fees and Permit Fees are set periodically by ordinance. Under exceptional circumstances, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation may waive or reduce the Revocable Use Permit Fee, in accordance with criteria established by SMC 18.28.030 or SMC 18.28.040. Creek restoration projects proposed by other City departments are specifically exempted from permit fees of any kind as the City recognizes these projects as valuable enhancements to its parks and recreation assets. In determining whether the Permit Fee should be waived or reduced, the Superintendent shall be guided by:

 o The benefit to the public and the direct benefit to the park system;

 o The frequency and/or amount of usage requested;

 o The effect on and fairness to other park users;

 o Consistency with policies underlying the fee schedule and SMC Chapter 18; and

 o The consequences of denying the request.

 The Superintendent may, at his or her discretion, authorize the acceptance of permanent physical improvements, such as constructed improvements or landscaping, as compensation in lieu of the Permit Fee in those circumstances where the proposed in lieu compensation can be shown to be equal to or greater in value than the calculated or set amount of the Permit Fee.

 Waiver or reduction of the Permit Fee does not necessarily waive or reduce other fees, charges, requirements, or obligations in connection with issuance of a Revocable Use Permit including Application Fee, Inspection Fee, processing charges, insurance or indemnity requirements, or restoration requirements.

 Limited Term Permit Fee

 Limited Term permits may be issued for necessary uses of park property for brief periods of time, generally expected to be limited to ninety (90) days or less; however, Limited Term permits may be issued for uses expected to continue beyond ninety (90) days at the discretion of the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation. Examples of activities for which Limited Term permits may be issued include, but are not limited to, construction staging, temporary access, and utility installation.

 The Limited Term permit fee will be charged at a daily rate from the date the permit is issued or the date the use or occupancy of park property began, whichever is earlier, until the activity is completed and all conditions of the permit, including restoration of any damage to park land, have been satisfied. If seasonal factors, such as planting conditions or construction prohibitions, warrant a delay between the time the use or occupancy of park property is completed and the time the restoration is completed, no Permit Fee shall be charged for the interim period, unless the park land is unavailable for the use or enjoyment of the public.

 If a Revocable Use Permit is issued for a use of park land expected to continue for a limited period of time, such as a Limited Term permit, but for a period exceeding ninety (90) days, the fee shall be the daily rate set for Limited Term permits for the first ninety (90) days; the fee for the period exceeding ninety (90) days shall be calculated in accordance with the Continuing Use permit fee.

 Under no circumstances shall a Limited Term permit fee be converted to a lesser fee due to extension of the anticipated completion date of the permitted activity. If upon inspection it is determined that the permit conditions have not been satisfied, charges for additional daily fees at the same rate shall accrue until conditions have been satisfied. Continuing Use Permit Fee

 Continuing Use permit fees shall be charged for uses expected to continue for an extended period of time, generally beyond ninety (90) days (e.g., encroachments or other non-park uses that will not be corrected or eliminated within a ninety (90) day period). Continuing Use permit fees shall be calculated using a formula based on land Value, Area of use, a Barrier factor, and a Rate of return (V x A x B x R).

 The Value of the park land used shall be determined by calculating the average of the assessed value per square foot of the benefited property and the assessed values per square foot of comparable (i.e., similarly zoned, having similar amenities such as waterfront or view), nearby (within a distance not to exceed 1,000 feet) non-park properties.

 The Area shall be the total of the square footage of park land actually used or occupied for non-park purposes and/or the square footage of park land that is subject to a barrier to public use and/or enjoyment.

 The Barrier Factor is a multiplier of 1 or less than 1, representing the extent of barrier to public use and enjoyment, as set by the following scale. If two or more Barrier Factors may apply, the greater factor shall apply.

 Factor: 1.00 Full use and/or occupancy of area, preventing public use or occupancy of the area (e.g., a private structure) ; or creation of a physical barrier denying public use or access to the area (e.g., a fence or hedge);

 .70 Creation of a perceptual barrier by improvements or actions that capture the public space for private use (e.g., paving, shrubbery, other plantings);

 .35 Private landscaping or other improvements on park land that violate, exceed, or are inconsistent with established design guidelines or reasonable standards intended to preserve the public park-like character of park lands (e.g., private access drive or walkway in excess of standard; private lighting or safety railings that exceed a security function).

 The Rate of return (i.e., land capitalization rate) is set at 10%.

 Continuing Use permit fees for permit periods of less than twelve (12) months are payable in full prior to permit issuance. Continuing use permit fees for permit periods anticipated to continue for twelve (12) months or more may be pro-rated and annualized and payable in advance for such annualized date as the Department shall establish. If the permit period is shorter than anticipated, the permit fees paid in advance shall be prorated for the time used and over-payment shall be refunded, except in the case of revocation due to Permittee's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit, in which case no refund shall be given. Permits for utility installations, such as electrical, natural gas, or telephone service, shall be charged as Limited Term permits, based on the permit period necessary for installation.There is no Permit Fee charged for Limited Term permits of ninety (90) days or less issued expressly to allow the removal or elimination of an encroachment onto park land.

 There is no Permit Fee charged for certain non-park uses of park land which may be allowable by property right, such as driveway access from the roadway portion of a park boulevard if access is not available from any other right-of-way, or pedestrian walkway from a public sidewalk to the abutting private property, if such uses comply with established design guidelines or reasonable standards intended to preserve the public park-like character of park lands.
