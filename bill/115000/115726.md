 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Subsection 14.08.010A is amended as follows:

 A. This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the "Open Housing Ordinance." The general purposes of this chapter are to promote the availability and accessibility of housing and real property to all persons; to prohibit unfair practices in real property transactions, whether direct or indirect, which inexcusably and unjustifiably deny those persons equal rights and opportunities in acquiring, disposing of or occupying real property and to provide enforcement mechanisms for the accomplishment of such purposes. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes. The ~~Seattle Office for Civil Rights~~Department shall enforce the provisions of this chapter to further this policy. ~~Consistent with SMC 3.14.911, the Department shall adopt a rule, which requires owners or other persons to post signs upon property subject to the provisions of this Chapter or at other locations which indicate that such property is available for lease or purchase on a basis which is nondiscriminatory under the provisions of this Chapter. A person violating such rule shall be subject to a $500 penalty for each day of violation~~.

 Section 2. A new Section is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 SMC 14.08.015 Seattle Open Housing Poster

 All persons required to post a fair housing poster pursuant to 24 CFR 110 shall also post a Seattle Open Housing Poster at the same locations required in the federal regulation. A person who fails to post an Seattle Open Housing Poster as required in this Section is subject to a fine of $125 for a first violation and a fine of $500 for each subsequent violation. The Seattle Open Housing Poster shall provide a notice that it is illegal in the City of Seattle to discriminate against any person because of race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, sex, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, participation in a section 8 program, the presence of any disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a disabled person. The Department shall adopt a rule or rules to enforce this Section which shall include the availability of such posters from the Department.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
