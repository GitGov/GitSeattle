 Section 2. In the event that Sound Transit applies for City approval of a pedestrian bridge, the requirements of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.64 and Seattle Department of Transportation Director's Rule 2-06 shall apply to such application only to the extent set forth herein. Sound Transit shall include, in any application for a proposed pedestrian bridge that is connected to a tunnel station, analysis of a pedestrian tunnel alternative in addition to the proposed pedestrian bridge, at the same general level of design completion, including analysis of design, safety and security, compatibility with surroundings, environmental impacts, cost, and other relevant attributes of both the proposed pedestrian bridge and a pedestrian tunnel alternative. The design of the proposed pedestrian bridge shall be reviewed by the Light Rail Review Panel. With regard to any proposed pedestrian bridge to be connected to the University of Washington Station, the Light Rail Review Panel is directed to coordinate its review, to the extent practicable, with any review by the University of Washington. The Light Rail Review Panel shall make its recommendation regarding the proposed pedestrian bridge to the Seattle Department of Transportation. The Director of Transportation shall consider the Panel's recommendation and the elements set forth in Seattle Municipal Code section 15.64.050B, and shall make a recommendation to the City Council. The City Council shall decide by resolution whether to grant conceptual approval of the proposed pedestrian bridge, either with or without conditions. If the Council grants conceptual approval, then final approval shall be granted in the same manner that the City grants final approval to Sound Transit for other Light Rail Transit Facilities within the Light Rail Transit Way, by the filing with the City Clerk by the Director of Transportation of approved final plans that are consistent with the Council's conceptual approval. The process for final approval of such Light Rail Transit Facilities is set forth in the "Agreement Between the City of Seattle and Sound Transit for Grant of Non-Exclusive Use of a Light Rail Transit Way as Related to the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project," as that Agreement exists after being amended by this Ordinance or subsequent Ordinances. Final approval of a pedestrian bridge connected to a Light Rail Transit Station shall remain in effect, as does City approval of other portions of the Light Rail Transit System, for so long as the Light Rail Transit Way is used for public transportation purposes.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
