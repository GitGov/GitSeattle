 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the fees for the vacation of streets and other public rights-of-way; exempting City departments from paying the street vacation fee; closing the Street Vacation Compensation Fund of the General Fund; establishing a new Street Vacation Subaccount within the Capital Projects Account of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund; authorizing the transfer of all balances and appropriation authority within the Street Vacation Compensation Fund to the Street Vacation Subaccount; amending or repealing Seattle Municipal Code Subsections 15.62.090A and C, and Seattle Municipal Code Sections 5.80.020 and 5.80.030, in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the State Legislature, in the 2001 Legislative Session, amended RCW Chapter 35.79 to grant cities the authority to charge compensation for street vacations that is equal to the full appraised value of the right-of-way for all streets that have been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for twenty-five years or more; and

 WHEREAS, the City last amended Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 in November 2001 through Ordinance 120607 to charge the maximum amount allowed by State Law from all petitioners, other than State or Federal agencies; and

 WHEREAS, the City now wishes to extend the exemption granted to State and Federal agencies to City departments to reduce administrative and accounting costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Street Vacation Compensation Fund (00310), a subfund of the General Fund, was established in 2001 by ordinance 120607 for deposit of one half of the revenue received pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 to be used for the acquisition, improvement, and development of public open spaces or for transportation capital projects; and

 WHEREAS, a new subaccount of the Capital Projects Account of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund is the preferred financial tool for the deposit and appropriation of one half of the street vacation fees that are collected by the City, as it will segregate these revenues from other City funds for tracking, investment, and reporting purposes; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2005, there is hereby established as a Subaccount of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund's Capital Projects Account, a Street Vacation Subaccount. One-half of the revenue received by the City as compensation for areas vacated pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 shall be deposited into the Street Vacation Subaccount. The revenues so received shall be used to pay for the acquisition, improvement, and development of public open space or for transportation capital projects.

 Section 2. Effective January 1, 2005, a new Subsection F is added to Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.80.030 as follows:

 F. The Street Vacation Subaccount shall, unless provided otherwise by ordinance, be comprised of one-half of the revenue received by the City as compensation for any street or alley that is vacated. Expenditures shall be dedicated to the acquisition, improvement, and development of public open space or transportation capital projects.

 Section 3. Effective January 1, 2005, Subsection A and Subsection C of Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 are hereby amended or repealed as follows:

 15.62.090 Compensation for vacation

 A. Ordinances vacating any street or alley or part thereof shall not be passed by the City Council until a sum equal to one-half (1/2) of the appraised value of the area vacated is paid to the City, provided that if the street or alley has been a part of a dedicated public right-of-way for twenty-five years or more, the City shall be compensated in an amount equal to the full appraised value of the area vacated. In certain circumstances, provision of other valuable consideration acceptable to the City may be made in lieu or up to one- half (1/2) of the payment; provided that such consideration shall not be acceptable if it is required for the street vacation, it is considered a public benefit to meet the public benefit requirements of the street vacation, or it is required by other regulatory action. Acceptable consideration shall be quantified in dollars which shall then be credited to the required payment. City, State and federal agencies shall be exempt from such payment, but shall pay to the City all costs incurred by the City in processing the vacation request. As contemplated by RCW 35.79.035(3), the full market value shall be paid upon vacation of streets abutting upon bodies of water.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
