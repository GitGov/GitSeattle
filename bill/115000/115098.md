 3. Minimum Charge, No Pickup Service. A charge per month or portion thereof, for each dwelling unit, including single-family dwellings not being used as residences, billed directly to the owner or occupant of Six Dollars and Twenty-five Cents ($6.25) to cover landfill closure costs, billing, collection, Low Income Rate Assistance, hazardous waste costs, and litter cleanup costs. Effective April 1, 2005, a charge per month or portion thereof, for each dwelling unit, including single-family dwellings not being used as residences, billed directly to the owner or occupant of Six Dollars and Thirty-Five Cents ($6.35) to cover landfill closure costs, billing, collection, Low Income Rate Assistance, hazardous waste costs, and litter cleanup costs. To be eligible for the minimum charge (zero (0) container rate) a customer may not generate any garbage or rubbish for collection or disposal. With occupied premises, the customer must demonstrate a consistent and effective practice of selective purchasing to minimize refuse, of recycling materials whenever practical, and of composting any yardwastes generated on the premises and the customer must have qualified for the rate on or before December 31, 1988. A customer is not eligible for the zero (0) container rate by hauling his or her garbage and rubbish to a transfer station, disposal site, or by disposal in another customer's containers or by the use of prepaid stickers. Vacant multifamily units do not qualify for the minimum charge.

 4. Extra Bundles. A charge of Five Dollars and Fifty Cents ($5.50) for a bundle. Effective April 1, 2005, a charge of Five Dollars and Sixty Cents ($5.60) for a bundle.

 7. Providing, Exchanging and Replacing Containers. There will be a charge of Nineteen Dollars ($19) per container to customers on curbside/alley service for providing a container or exchanging or replacing lost, stolen or damaged collector-supplied containers with the same size or larger containers.

 8. New/Changed Account. A charge of Ten Dollars ($10) for the establishment of a new account or for each change in an existing account. This charge shall apply when the owner or property manager of any single-family residence or multifamily structure (duplex, triplex, fourplex, or structure with five (5) or more units) establishes a new account or requests any change in his/her account requiring a change in account number or customer number. The new/changed account charge is not applicable to customers qualified for Low Income Rate Assistance.

 9. Physical Disability Exemption. An exemption will be provided to qualified residents to allow for backyard collection at curbside rates when the resident is physically unable to take his or her garbage and rubbish containers to the curb. Qualifying criteria shall include, but are not limited to, the resident's physical condition, qualification for backyard service in other City programs, a physician's recommendation, the presence of other physically capable persons in the household, special topography and other unique property conditions, taking into account the contractors' ability to provide different combinations of container sizes to make curbside pickup feasible.

 B. The City shall calculate the charge for each dwelling unit within apartment houses and apartment hotels and for each resident within boarding, rooming, fraternity, sorority and group student houses for two (2) times a week service, billed directly to the owner or agent for the entire building, by doubling the applicable garbage container rates in subsection A1 of this section and reducing this calculated amount by Three Dollars and Sixty-five Cents ($3.65) per unit to adjust for billing, collection, hazardous waste, and litter cleanup costs that occur only once a month.

 C. All Residential Customers Requesting and Receiving Nondetachable Container Special, Nonroutine Collection Service for Garbage, Yardwaste, or Recyclable Materials. The following charges shall apply to special collections of all nondetachable containers, bundles or bundles-of-yardwaste: a per-pickup charge of Twenty-four Dollars ($24) for first unit collected plus Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50) for each additional unit.

 D. The charges imposed by subsections A1 through A3 of this section inclusive shall not apply to dwelling units which elect to use detachable containers supplied either by the City's contractor or by the customer for the storage of garbage and rubbish.
