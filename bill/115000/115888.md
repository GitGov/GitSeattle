 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the development of a Mobility Plan to replace the central waterfront portion of the Alaskan Way Viaduct; directing the Seattle Department of Transportation to develop a Mobility Plan; providing principles for the development and implementation of the Mobility Plan; lifting a budget proviso restricting the use of funds; and reducing and reappropriating with limitations certain appropriations in the 2007 Budget.

 WHEREAS, the replacement of the Viaduct is a 100-year decision that will profoundly affect the region's economy, transportation network, urban environment, and the enjoyment of the waterfront by all; and

 WHEREAS, in September 2006 the City Council adopted Ordinances 122246 and 122247 explicitly rejecting a new elevated structure to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, declaring the tunnel as the City's preferred alternative for the project, and recommending the development of a surface street and transit alternative that meets the intent of Resolutions 30664 and 30724 should the Tunnel Alternative become infeasible; and

 WHEREAS, in January 2007 the City Council adopted Resolution 30960, reaffirming its explicit rejection of a new elevated structure and reaffirming its findings and declarations in Ordinance 122247 that a new elevated structure would be contrary to the goals and objectives of the Waterfront Concept Plan, and to adopted City policies, including Comprehensive Plan policies approved pursuant to the State Growth Management Act, the State adopted Seattle Shoreline Master Program, and related implementing regulations; and

 WHEREAS, in response to the Governor's request to have a public vote on Viaduct replacement alternatives, the City Council voted on January 19, 2007 to place two advisory measures on the March 13, 2007 ballot asking voters their preference regarding two alternatives (the "Surface/Tunnel Hybrid Alternative" and the "Elevated Structure Alternative") for replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and

 WHEREAS, in the March 13, 2007 vote, Seattle voters rejected both the Surface/Tunnel Hybrid Alternative and the Elevated Structure Alternative to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 30960 the City also declared its intent to work in partnership with King County and the State of Washington to develop a fiscally responsible alternative for replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct that conforms to the City's Comprehensive Plan policies, the Seattle Shoreline Master Program, and related implementing regulations; and

 WHEREAS, when it declared a tunnel as the preferred alternative in Ordinance 122246, Council intended that if the tunnel option proved to be infeasible, the Council would direct the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) to begin work as soon as was practicable on a new surface street and transit alternative, consisting generally of surface improvements to the Alaskan Way corridor and enhanced transit services, instead of a new grade-separated highway along the central waterfront; and

 WHEREAS, the City and State need to begin work on new options that meet the goals of the City's Comprehensive Plan, the Seattle Shoreline Master Program, the Seattle Transit Plan, and other City policies, including reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and a shift away from the use of single occupant vehicles and toward transit alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, local action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is consistent with Seattle's environmental commitments and its other high priority policy objectives, including reducing traffic congestion, improving local air quality, encouraging salmon recovery, and restoring urban forests; and

 WHEREAS, the surface alternative analyzed in the Viaduct Replacement Project Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) did not anticipate significant enhancements to available transit service or assess transit or street network improvements that could be made; and

 WHEREAS, in their March 14, 2007 letter to the Seattle Legislative Delegation, the City Council and County Council, Mayor, Governor and County Executive jointly expressed their intent to establish guidelines and a collaborative and inclusive process that identifies a solution which will address issues such as vigorous public transit, freight mobility, business disruption, urban design, job creation, the preservation of our marine economy and the future of Seattle's waterfront;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Statement of Policy: Regional transportation projects within the City should demonstrate consistency with the City's land use, economic, and environmental goals, including improving access to and through downtown for all modes of travel and groups using the transportation system (e.g., transit, freight, vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, tourists, and cruise ship and ferry passengers, and commuters). Any such transportation projects should protect the City's economy, recognize Seattle's role as a global trade gateway, enhance freight mobility, and provide for the efficient movement of people and goods, with the least amount of disruption during construction. Development of transportation projects for accommodating trips made on the central waterfront section of the Alaskan Way Viaduct shall prioritize the movement of people and goods. Further, the City Council intends to direct 2007 funds appropriated to SDOT for work on the Viaduct project toward the development of an urban mobility plan pursuant to Section 9 of this ordinance.

 Section 2. Development of the Urban Mobility Plan: The City Council directs SDOT to work in collaboration with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and King County to develop an Urban Mobility Plan to prioritize the movement of people and goods through:

 * improvements to the entire downtown street grid, major entry points to downtown, and the Alaskan Way corridor along the central waterfront;

 * strategic investments in transit including use of priority treatments and other mechanisms to enhance transit service;

 * other traffic-management techniques including trip-reduction strategies to reduce the number of vehicles on downtown streets; and

 * Early implementation of the urban mobility measures identified in Section 6 of this ordinance.

 Section 3. Guiding Principles for the Urban Mobility Plan: The following principles shall guide development of the Urban Mobility Plan:

 a) Enhance Urban Mobility Throughout the City:

 1. Consider transportation demand strategies such as lane prioritization, congestion pricing and regional tolling;

 2. Look broadly for opportunities to enhance access to and through downtown, including advancing the goals of the Center City Access Strategy; improving regional transit service; increasing opportunities for alternative forms of transportation; limiting parking on downtown streets during peak periods; and creating dedicated bus lanes through downtown;

 3. Expedite implementation of Transit Now and Rapid Ride through investing in capital projects supporting bus rapid transit, and advocating for increased bus service hours in order to increase mobility prior to beginning work on the Viaduct projects that have been identified by the Governor, County Executive and Mayor as projects that are necessary irrespective of the option chosen for replacing the central waterfront section of the Viaduct (Moving Forward: Early Safety and Mobility Projects) and to reduce carbon emissions;

 4. Look for ways to improve the overall efficiency of I-5 for through trips;

 5. Enhance and connect bicycle access routes, including facilities to accommodate bicyclists, in order to increase bicycling as a safe and convenient mode of transportation; and

 6. Enhance various types of pedestrian street crossings in order to increase transit ridership and pedestrian safety in traveling to and from work, school, and other destinations;

 b) Protect Economic Health of Businesses - Avoid or minimize construction and long-term traffic impacts to protect the economic health of:

 1. Downtown businesses - retain and promote downtown as a healthy business environment;

 2. Waterfront businesses - retain and promote waterfront businesses, including restaurants, shops, tourism-related businesses and the Port of Seattle harbor and shipping and rail functions, with the least amount of disruption;

 3. Freight and commercial businesses - maintain traffic movement and large vehicle access to downtown, including re-examining existing restrictions on large truck access to downtown, evaluating priority access at certain times of day, and enhancing access to and from key locations including the Port of Seattle and the designated manufacturing and industrial centers to the south and north of downtown;

 c) Maximize Public Open Space and Create a Pedestrian-Friendly Environment on the Waterfront - Design the central waterfront to be pedestrian-friendly through maximizing the amount of open space and incorporating measures to increase pedestrian safety, including furthering the goals of the Complete Streets policy as defined in Resolution 30915 and adopted in Ordinance 122386, incorporating the principles set forth in Resolution 30664 concerning development of a Central Waterfront Plan;

 d) Improve the Environment - Enhance all aspects of the environment, including air, noise, water quality, and near shore habitat; and

 e) Use Innovative Transportation Solutions - Use creative approaches to develop holistic transportation solutions to carry out the policy direction provided in Section 1 through the following:

 1. Consider a phased approach to removal of the existing Viaduct, construction of a new Alaskan Way surface street, and implementation of new transit options, all with the goal of minimizing traffic impacts and reducing the disruption of businesses on the central waterfront, downtown, and other businesses impacted by the proposed construction on Highway 99;

 2. Seek the advice of recognized experts in transportation planning and modeling, traffic engineering, land use and socioeconomic analysis, urban roadway and public space design, and public outreach; and

 3. Identify the funding needed to finance the most effective ways to move people and goods through multiple modes and then determine what changes are necessary in federal, state and local funding in order to implement and construct the projects identified in the Urban Mobility Plan.

 Section 4. Proposed Scope of Work within 45 Days: The City Council directs SDOT in collaboration with WSDOT and King County to present to Council for review and approval within 45 days of passage of this ordinance, a written report including a proposed scope of work for completing the Urban Mobility Plan by July 1, 2008 for Council review and possible approval. This scope of work will detail the approach for development of the Urban Mobility Plan based on the Guiding Principles detailed in Section 3, and will include a timeline for development, an assessment of the resources needed to complete the Urban Mobility Plan and deadlines for presentation of the Urban Mobility Plan to Council for review and approval. The proposed scope of work shall also include, but not be limited to: 1) analysis of origin and destination data for all Viaduct users; 2) identification and assessment of the need for increased transit service and other mobility improvements to the downtown street grid; and 3) refinement of the Moving Forward: Early Safety and Mobility Project components identified by the Governor, County Executive, and Mayor in coordination with development of the Urban Mobility Plan.

 Section 5. Identify and Involve Key Stakeholders: The City Council requests SDOT to work with WSDOT and King County to develop a stakeholder involvement process that is representative, open and transparent for development of the Urban Mobility Plan. Council intends that the stakeholder involvement process be presented with the scope of work identified in Section 4 of this ordinance for Council review and approval.

 Section 6. Related Urban Mobility Measures: The Council directs SDOT to work with WSDOT and King County to implement as soon as practicable measures related to the Urban Mobility Plan designed to improve mobility before, during, and after Viaduct-related construction projects. These urban mobility measures include:

 - The Viaduct-related project components identified by the Governor, County Executive, and Mayor (Moving Forward: Early Safety and Mobility Projects);

 - Improvements in operations of I-5 to enhance mobility through downtown;

 - Completion of the SR 519 project;

 - Construction of a new above-grade rail crossing at Lander Street;

 - Repairs and improvements for the Spokane Street Viaduct, including renovating the existing Spokane Street Viaduct and adding a new connection from the Spokane Street Viaduct to Fourth Avenue South to better connect with downtown;

 - Expansion of existing transit service, including the West Seattle water taxi, to achieve a higher mode split for transit;

 - Investments in capital improvements necessary to facilitate transit movement to and through downtown;

 - Development and full implementation of King County's Rapid Ride;

 - Improvements to the Mercer Corridor to facilitate traffic flow to and from I-5; and

 - Replacement of the Alaskan Way Seawall.
