 AN ORDINANCE related to the Traffic Code, amending Sections 11.16.121, 11.16.300, 11.72.400, and 11.76.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code to further refine the pay station program to include provisions for new payment technology and additional methods for the management of on-street paid parking.

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan establishes a transportation goal to consider installing longer-term paid on-street parking along edges of downtown Seattle and neighborhood commercial districts in the Center City, or in office and institutional zones, to regulate curb space where short-term retail or customer on-street parking demand is low and employee parking demand is high; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004 the City of Seattle Department of Transportation started a program to replace single-space parking meters with parking pay stations to provide improved parking management, customer service, streetscape enhancement, and revenue benefits and has installed since April 2004, over 1,100 pay station machines now controlling over 10,000 paid parking spaces; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation is considering also using pay-by-space parking technology, in addition to pay-and-display pay stations, that electronically measure the lawful parking period and its expiration for specific parking spaces; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation is developing an innovative new system of parking management called performance-based pricing that permits extended stay parking purchases beyond the traditional two-hour time limit, and entails quarterly reviews and potential adjustments of hourly parking rates to achieve a desired target parking occupancy rate during peak use periods; and

 WHEREAS, the objective of performance-based pricing is to use pricing adjustments instead of time-limits to ensure an adequate parking availability for business visitors, customers, area employees, and other on-street parking users; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 11.16.121 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 121420, is amended as follows:

 B. In establishing parking rates, the Director shall consider the following objectives:

 1. To maintain adequate turnover of on-street parking spaces and reduce incidents of meter feeding in commercial districts;

~~2. To discourage long-term commuter and employee parking in on-street parking areas and encourage use of off-street parking facilities; and~~

2. To encourage an adequate amount of on-street parking availability for a variety of parking users, efficient use of off- street parking facilities, and enhanced use of transit and other transportation alternatives; and,

 3. To reduce congestion in travel lanes caused by drivers seeking on-street parking.
