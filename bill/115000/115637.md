 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.33.030 to adjust drainage rates; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.76.040 to adjust credits to low-income drainage customers accordingly.

 WHEREAS, the rates for drainage services were last increased on January 1, 2006, as authorized by Ordinance 121639; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") has developed a Comprehensive Drainage Plan ("CDP") which recommends operating programs and capital projects to reduce flooding, improve water quality, improve drainage along major arterials, and restore creek habitat affected by stormwater draining through creek systems; and

 WHEREAS, the cost to implement CDP-recommended programs and projects in 2007 will result in increased annual expenses for debt service, cash financing of capital projects and operations; and

 WHEREAS, a significant bond issuance occurred in 2006 to finance a portion of the drainage capital improvement projects and that this issuance will further increase annual drainage expenses for debt service beginning in 2007; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the costs of providing drainage services and pay debt service and that rate increases therefore are required; and

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers need to be revised to reflect an increase in drainage rates; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection D of Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.33.030 is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.030 Drainage service charges -- Schedule -- Exemptions.

 SPU shall provide a 10% reduction in drainage rates for properties containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that meet the performance requirement that the systems are sized to use or infiltrate the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, ~~24 hour~~24-hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King County Department of Health ~~in order~~ to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage rate reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement stated above. Qualifying for the drainage rate reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code requirements for the buildings and site.
