 AGREEMENT

 In consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 Article 1. Agreement to Purchase and Sell.

 1.01 Property Being Sold

 Seller agrees to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, as provided in this Contract and subject to the conditions herein, the parcel of land ("Land") that is described as the "Land" in Exhibit A, referred to herein, together with any improvements, fixtures and appurtenances, as the "Real Estate."

 1.02 LaSalle Building; Project Development

 (a) Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser is the sole owner in fee simple of the land and building adjacent to the Land, legally described as the "LaSalle" on Exhibit A hereto (together with all fixtures and improvements now or hereafter thereon, the "LaSalle"), subject to no liens or encumbrances except the following:

 (b) Purchaser intends to develop the Land in conjunction with the renovation of the LaSalle, as generally described in the Project Description attached hereto as Exhibit F, and subject to applicable codes, regulatory processes, and permits. The Real Estate, with all improvements and fixtures hereafter thereon, and the LaSalle, are referred to herein together as the "Creamery/LaSalle" and the development of the Creamery/LaSalle as contemplated by this Agreement is referred to as the "Project".

 Article 2. Purchase Price and Purchase Money Mortgage; Subordination

 2.01 Purchase Price; Purchase Money Note; Satisfaction Based on In- kind Benefits.

 Purchaser shall, at Closing, deliver a promissory note, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Purchase Money Note"), in the amount of the Purchase Price that is specified in Item IV above. The interest rate on the Purchase Money Note shall be 5% per annum. If the Purchaser shall have complied fully with the terms of the Covenant described in Section 3.03 for 16 years after the Completion Date, then all interest accrued on the Purchase Money Note shall be deemed to have been paid, and no further interest shall accrue so long as Purchaser continues to comply with the provisions of the Covenant that then remain in effect (by the terms of the Covenant, sections 3 and 10(b) thereof will then no longer be in effect). On each anniversary of the Completion Date beginning with the 17th such anniversary, so long as Purchaser continues to comply fully with the remaining applicable provisions of the Covenant, a portion of the principal equal to 5% of the original Purchase Price shall be deemed paid, until the entire Purchase Money Note is satisfied.

 2.02 Purchase Money Documents.

 The "Purchase Money Documents" are the Purchase Money Note, the Purchase Money Mortgage, any additional documents granted or delivered as security for the Purchase Money Note.

 2.03 Purchase Money Mortgage.

 (a) The Purchase Money Note shall be secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing on the Creamery/LaSalle granted by Purchaser, in form and content acceptable to Seller ("Purchase Money Mortgage"). The parties acknowledge that to complete the financing for the Project, the Purchaser intends to form a condominium, involving the creation of at least three separate condominium units for the residential, commercial and senior center uses of the Creamery/LaSalle (the "Housing Unit", "Commercial Unit" and Senior Center Unit" respectively), and to convey to a limited liability company controlled by Purchaser ("Company") that part of the Creamery/LaSalle, which may include undeveloped airspace, that comprises the Housing Unit, and that Purchaser would receive upon such transfer a promissory note from the Company secured by a deed of trust on the Housing Unit. If

 (1) the terms of all condominium documents, and such note and deed of trust, are acceptable to the Seller;

 (2) the Purchaser is otherwise in full compliance with the terms of this Contract;

 (3) the terms of any agreements related to the transfer provide assurance deemed adequate by the Mayor or his designee that the Purchaser, or a successor entity approved by the City, will have the right to reacquire title to the Housing Unit by 2023 on terms that will not require significant public funds, and that in the event the Purchaser should cease to be the manager of the Company, any successor manager would be a nonprofit or public entity approved by the City;

 (4) that all relevant documents shall have been submitted to the Seller at least 30 days in advance and Purchaser shall have given such other notices as are required by Section 9.03 of this Agreement or by law;

 (5) the Seller receives such title insurance or endorsements thereto as the Seller may require, then the Seller shall permit the conveyance of the Housing Unit to the Company, subject to the terms of Section 10.03. Such conveyance may, to the extent deemed necessary by the Mayor or his designee, be conditioned upon the execution by Purchaser, delivery and recording of an assignment for security purposes, in form and content acceptable to the Seller, with respect to the note and deed of trust from the Company, and the delivery of such note to the Seller duly indorsed by the Purchaser. Such note and deed of trust in favor of the Purchaser shall have priority over any other obligations of the Company in favor of the Purchaser, and security therefor, except as may be otherwise approved by the Seller, but shall be subordinate to the Deed of Trust and to any liens to which the Deed of Trust is subordinated. The option or other agreement provided to satisfy clause (4) above must contain provisions satisfactory to the Seller permitting assignment and providing the Seller with rights of notice and opportunity to cure before any loss or termination of such option or other rights by reason of default, failure to exercise, failure to satisfy conditions, or otherwise. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to permit such conveyance, (x) Seller shall subordinate the lien of the Deed of Trust to the liens and covenants reasonably required for the Company's financing of the development of the Creamery/LaSalle as contemplated in this Contract, as well as to commercial financing reasonably required for the Authority's financing of the Commercial Unit, with the sole exception of liens in favor of Purchaser; and (y) Seller shall agree that Seller shall be precluded from foreclosing the Purchase Money Mortgage on the Housing Unit, as a result of any default arising solely from or relating solely to the Commercial Unit or Senior Center Unit, for the time period commencing on the date of the admission of the investor member into the Company and continuing through the 15th year of the initial low income housing tax credit compliance period, but in any event no longer than through December 31, 2022. Seller acknowledges that the financing for the development of the Creamery/LaSalle is intended to include the financing identified on Exhibit E hereto, but the Seller does not hereby make any commitment or assurance that funding from the City will be provided.

 (b) Any obligation of the Seller to grant any subordination hereunder is conditioned upon the delivery to Seller, at least 10 days in advance of the date when Purchaser desires a subordination agreement to be delivered, of the proposed form of subordination agreement and all documents related to the liens or encumbrances to which subordination is requested, as well as documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Seller that the conditions to subordination are satisfied or will be satisfied as of the date of deliver and recording of the subordination agreement. In addition, any subordination may be conditioned upon such changes to the form of subordination agreement as the Seller may require, and the issuance to the Seller of one or more endorsements to the Seller's title insurance policy, as the Seller may require.

 Pursuant to RCW 35.21.747 and Seattle Ordinances 121141 and ____________, this deed is made subject to, and the Grantor reserves the rights and interests of The City of Seattle set forth in, that certain Covenant for Low-Income Housing and Senior Services granted by Grantee dated as of the date hereof and recorded on the date of recording hereof, which is incorporated herein by this reference.

 Grantee's Covenants, Releases and Indemnity ("Covenant")

 The Property is conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL-FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE GRANTEE'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. Grantee acknowledges that adverse physical, economic or other conditions (including without limitation, adverse environmental soils and ground- water conditions), either latent or patent, may exist on the Property and assumes Grantor's responsibility for all environmental conditions of the Property, known or unknown, including but not limited to responsibility, if any, for investigation, removal or remediation actions relating to the presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance or other environmental contamination relating to the Property. Grantee also releases, covenants not to sue, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Grantor and its past, present and future officials, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties, fees, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to fees and costs of regulatory agencies, attorneys, contractors and consultants), and liabilities arising out of, or in any way connected with, the condition of the Property including but not limited to any alleged or actual past, present or future presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property, or any portion thereof or improvement thereon, from any cause whatsoever; it being intended that Grantee shall so indemnify Grantor and such personnel without regard to any fault or responsibility of Grantor or Grantee. Grantee is aware of the rights it might otherwise have to seek recovery from Grantor for costs of remediation and cleanup of Hazardous Substances under applicable law, including without limitation the Washington Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA") and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and Grantee hereby knowingly waives all such rights, now existing or hereafter arising, and voluntarily relinquishes those rights and forever releases the Grantor from any such obligation. The obligation to complete all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of the Property and the acknowledgements, releases, and covenants herein touch and concern the Property, are intended to run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and assigns.

 Grantee's release and covenant not to sue shall include both claims by Grantee as original plaintiff against Grantor and any cross-claims, third-party claims or other claims against Grantor by Grantee based upon claims made against Grantee by any third parties. The obligation to indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action costs and natural resources damages claims. This Covenant means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-is, where-is and with-all-faults," and that Grantee assumes all responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any environmental conditions on the Property and has no recourse against Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or liability with respect to the Property. This Covenant shall apply regardless of whether or not Grantee is culpable, negligent or in violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation. Nothing herein shall release, discharge or affect any rights or causes of action that Grantor or Grantee may have against any other person or entity, except as otherwise expressly stated herein, and each of the parties reserves all such rights including, but not limited to, claims for contribution or cost recovery relating to any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property.

 The terms of this Covenant are in addition to, and not in substitution for, those terms of the Contract for Sale of Real Property dated ______________, 2004 between Grantor and Grantee (the "Contract") that, by the terms of such Contract, survive the delivery of this deed.

 Condition Subsequent / Power of Termination. This conveyance is subject to the following condition and power of termination which shall be binding on the Grantee and its successors and assigns, and to which Grantee agrees on behalf of Grantee and its successors and assigns:

 1. Condition Subsequent. This Deed and all rights of Grantee hereunder are subject to a condition subsequent upon the occurrence of which Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns shall have the absolute right, subject only to the express limitations set forth herein, to terminate, by notice to Grantee or by reentering and taking possession of the Property, the estate conveyed under this deed and all rights of all persons claiming by or through Grantee, whereupon fee simple title to the Property shall revest entirely in Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns. The condition subsequent shall have occurred unless all of the following shall have occurred on or before July 1, 2005:

 (1) Grantee shall have obtained from the Seattle Department of Planning and Development ("DPD") the Master Use Permit for the development of the Property consistent with the Project Description; and

 (2) Grantee shall have obtained all permits required to commence construction of the Improvements from DPD, or DPD shall have given written notice that such permits are ready to issue.

 2. Certificate of Compliance. Upon recording of a Certificate of Compliance duly signed by the Director of the Office of Finance of the Grantor, stating that the Grantee has timely satisfied the above requirements such that the condition subsequent cannot occur, or that if such requirements have not been timely satisfied they have been waived by the City, the condition subsequent in this deed shall be of no further force or effect.

 3. Miscellaneous. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Contract. Reference is made to Section 10.03 of the Contract for certain provisions related to this power of termination. Time is of the essence of all of the provisions hereof.

 Exhibit F to Contract for Sale of Land Exhibit F -- Project Description

 The project involves the rehabilitation of the historic LaSalle Hotel and the construction of a new 6-story addition on the adjacent Creamery lot. The new addition will include ground level commercial on Western Avenue, four residential floors, a part of the new Senior Center, and an open air plaza on top. The total cost is estimated to be $15,500,000.

 In the redevelopment of the LaSalle, some of the existing floors will be reconfigured to accommodate the addition and the new Senior Center. Eight of the existing residential units will be eliminated but will be replaced by new units in the Creamery/LaSalle. This project will renovate the existing units, redoing floors, kitchens and bathrooms. It will also repair and resurface the roof, improve the corridor ventilation system, upgrade the elevator controls, repair or replace deteriorating windows and add electrical submeters to each of the units. Each residential floor of the new addition will have 8 studio apartments, located off of a common corridor connected to the existing building and served by the existing elevator. After construction of the addition, there will be 32 units in the old LaSalle and 32 in the addition, for a total of 63 subsidized housing units and one manager's unit. Twenty of the units will be one-bedroom apartments and 44 will be studios. The project is intended primarily for low-income residents, and 13 of the units will be set-aside for persons with disabilities.

 This project has been designed to provide approximately 6,200 square feet of space, all on one level, for the new Senior Center. A portion of the new Center will be located on the fourth floor of the existing LaSalle Hotel, with the rest in the addition. The expansion of the Senior Center will enable it to double its hot lunch program and services to elderly residents of the downtown community.
