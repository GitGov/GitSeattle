 AN ORDINANCE relating to the South Lake Union Park Development Project; amending the 2006 Adopted Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation including transferring appropriations; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Seattle citizens have envisioned the creation of an accessible waterfront park at the south end of Lake Union ever since the Olmsted Park Plan was developed more than one hundred years ago; and

 WHEREAS, the 1998 South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan emphasized the development of the South Lake Union Park (SLU Park) as a top priority; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30080 authorized the property disposition process that led to the sale of City of Seattle (City) property in South Lake Union and set forth a number of policy objectives which continue to guide the City's actions; and

 WHEREAS, the 2000 Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy (hereafter 2000 Parks Levy) identified funding for the development of the SLU Park; and

 WHEREAS, the voters of Seattle approved the 2000 Parks Levy on November 7, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121963 authorized the execution of an Agreement between the Seattle Parks Foundation (Foundation) and the City of Seattle (the "Agreement"), delineating each party's roles and responsibilities relative to the design, development, and construction of SLU Park; and

 WHEREAS, the Agreement for the SLU Park Development Project provides that the construction of the SLU Park will be undertaken in two phases, the first to begin as soon as possible with funds already identified, and the second to begin after the Foundation has raised the $10,000,000 stipulated in its Agreement with the City; and

 WHEREAS, after the SLU Park Development Project had been designed and its budget approved, the Department of Parks and Recreation determined that the bulkhead was vulnerable and there were three options to deal with the situation: (1) build the SLU Park using the existing bulkhead, postponing its replacement until sometime in the future when it would inevitably fail; (2) cut back the SLU Park by 8,000 square feet, eliminating the ability to moor large ships along the bulkhead and reducing the length of the boardwalk; or (3) replace the bulkhead now rather than later; and

 WHEREAS, the current budget for Phase 1 of the SLU Park Development Project resulted in designs of the bulkhead at the Park that reduced the overall park land by approximately 8,000 square feet, eliminated the ability to moor large ships along the bulkhead, reduced the sizes of the bulkhead and boardwalk along the west side, and significantly limited the life expectancy of the bulkhead; and

 WHEREAS, the Foundation and the City of Seattle desire to maintain the size of the overall park land as reflected in the original project plan and keep the bulkhead at its original length; and

 WHEREAS, the Project Review Committee, consisting of City Investors, the Foundation, the Center for Wooden Boats, and City representatives, determined that the most cost effective, long-term solution dictates that the bulkhead be replaced before the park is built, thereby avoiding the disruption and higher cost of later replacement once the park is completed and in full usage; and

 WHEREAS, the Foundation and the City of Seattle desire to maintain the size of the overall park land as reflected in the original project plan and keep the bulkhead at its original length; and

 WHEREAS, the SLU Park Development Project cost has increased by $4,228,000, comprised of the bulkhead replacement and related site work and redesign, which had not been anticipated in the original park design, scope, and approved budget, as well as permit-related design costs for both phases of the Project, which had not been anticipated in the Phase 1 portion of the approved budget; and

 WHEREAS, various Capital Improvement Projects of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation have excess budget authority in 2006; and

 WHEREAS, the 1999 Community Center Levy Fund is projected to have a fund balance upon completion of all the Community Center Levy projects; and

 WHEREAS, due to the additional cost of replacing the bulkhead, the City Council wants to require that the added funds estimated for the bulkhead replacement are used solely for that purpose and that any under-spending on the bulkhead replacement is recaptured by the City; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council is concerned that the costs of future project phases stay within the approved SLU Park Development Project budget and be fully offset by pledges and cash donations raised by the Foundation in its $10 million fundraising effort, as well as other resources identified in the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, between 1984 and 2003, the City has invested approximately $17.5 million in the purchase and interim development of SLU Park and allocated another $5 million in 2000 Parks Levy funds toward the planning, design, and development of the Park, and through this ordinance appropriates an additional $4,228,000 for the development of the Park; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends that no additional City funds will be appropriated to achieve the SLU Park Improvement Plan if private fundraising does not meet its goals, aside from the provisions relating to possible failure to satisfy conditions on the availability of the City Investor's additional $5 million in funding for Phase 2 as contained in Section 3.4 of the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to review a then-current project budget and scope along with a status report on the Foundation's fundraising efforts before making any future appropriation for the SLU Park Development Project; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
