 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to transportation facilities; providing for the submission to the voters of the City, at an election to be held therein on November 7, 2006, in conjunction with the state election to be held on the same date, of a proposition authorizing the City to incur indebtedness by issuing its general obligation bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, payable in part by annual property tax levies to be made in excess of regular property tax levies, for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of designing, constructing, acquiring, improving, renovating, and equipping transportation facilities and to levy those excess property taxes; and requesting an election.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City of Seattle (the "City") is authorized to design, construct, acquire, improve, renovate and equip transportation facilities comprised of four elements: (a) King Street Station Restoration and Rehabilitation, to which up to $25,750,000 of Bond proceeds shall be devoted; (b) Lander Street Overpass, to which up to $20,600,000 of Bond proceeds shall be devoted; (c) Mercer Corridor, to which up to $30,900,000 of Bond proceeds shall be devoted; and (d) Spokane Street Viaduct to which up to $30,900,000 of Bond proceeds shall be devoted (collectively, the "Project"). The estimated cost of the Project exceeds the amount of the Bonds authorized by this ordinance. The difference between the amount of Bonds authorized in this ordinance and the total estimated cost of the Project is expected to be paid from other public and/or private fund sources. The economic life of the Project is expected to be at least twenty (20) years, although the useful life of some of the elements of the Project will vary from this number.

 Section 2. The City shall incur indebtedness and borrow an amount not to exceed $108,150,000 on the credit of the City and issue and sell its general obligation bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, which may include but are not limited to, lease obligations, ("Bonds") in an amount not to exceed that principal amount for strictly municipal capital purposes, other than the replacement of equipment, to provide all or part of the funds for the Project. Costs of engineering, architectural, planning, project management, financial, legal and other services lawfully incurred incident to the Project, costs of issuance and sale of the Bonds, an apportionment equal to not more than one percent (1%) of construction expenditures on the Project upon public works for art pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 20.32.030, shall be appropriate capital costs to be paid from the proceeds of the Bonds authorized by this ordinance.

 The City Council declares that to the extent, if any, the City prior to the date that Bonds or other short-term obligations are issued to finance the Project shall make capital expenditures for the Project from funds that are not (and are not reasonably expected to be) reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or otherwise set aside by the City under its existing and reasonably foreseeable budgetary and financial circumstances to finance the Project, those capital expenditures are intended to be reimbursed out of proceeds of the Bonds or other short-term obligations issued in an amount not to exceed the principal amount authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 3. Elements may be deleted from the Project only by an ordinance amending the list set forth in Attachment A, passed by a two-thirds vote of the City Council after a public hearing. The maximum amounts of Bond proceeds to be devoted to each element of the Project, as established in Section 1, may be changed only by an ordinance passed by a two-thirds vote of the City Council after a public hearing. Should the funds, including the bond proceeds, available for the Project be insufficient to complete the Project, the City may delay completion of all or any element of the Project until adequate funding is available, but no elements shall be eliminated from the Project absent compliance with the first sentence of this Section 3.

 Section 4. The City will seek supplemental, matching or additional funds from other sources to pay all or part of the cost of the Project or any component thereof and, if successful, may apply such funds to accomplishment thereof. If the Project shall have been completed and Bond proceeds remain unexpended, then those proceeds shall be deposited in the City's general obligation bond fund.

 Section 5. The Bonds shall be issued in one or more series, or as a part of a combined issue or issues with other authorized bonds, and shall be issued within ten years of the date of voter approval of the Bonds. The Bonds also may evidence a line or lines of credit. The Bonds shall bear interest (which may be fixed or variable) payable as permitted by law; may mature serially or as term bonds with the longest maturities being within twenty years from their date or within any shorter period fixed by ordinance; and shall be issued and sold in the manner, at the times and in the amounts as shall be determined by or pursuant to ordinance. The exact date, form, terms, options of prior redemption, price, interest rate or rates and maturities of the Bonds and pledges and covenants shall be fixed hereafter by or pursuant to ordinance. The Bonds shall be paid by annual property tax levies sufficient in amount to pay both principal and interest when due, which annual property tax levies shall be made in excess of regular property tax levies without limitation as to rate or amount but only in amounts sufficient to pay both principal and interest when due.

 Pending the issuance of the Bonds and receipt of their proceeds, the City may authorize the issuance of short-term obligations pursuant to chapter 39.50 RCW, and the costs of those short-term obligations shall be included in the cost of the Project for which the Bonds are issued.

 Section 6. The Seattle Department of Transportation shall submit to the Mayor and City Council at least once a year, and more often if required by ordinance, a report on the progress in completing the Project; a report on leveraged funds obtained from grants, other agencies, or other sources to help pay the cost of the Project; a comparison of actual to budgeted expenditures for each individual element; and compliance with the terms of this and other ordinances related to the Project.

 Section 7. The City Council finds that the City does not have sufficient funds available to the meet the cost of the Project, and that the conditions set forth herein create an emergency which requires the holding of a special election in the City. The City accordingly requests that the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington, as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, conduct a special election in the City in conjunction with the state general election to be held on November 7, 2006 for the purpose of submitting to the qualified electors of the City for their approval the question of whether or not the City shall be authorized to borrow money in an amount not to exceed $108,150,000, issue its general obligation bonds or other evidences of indebtedness in that principal amount only for capital purposes other than replacement of equipment, and levy the excess taxes necessary to redeem the Bonds as herein set forth.

 Section 8. The City Clerk is directed promptly to certify to the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington, as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, a copy of this ordinance and the proposition to be submitted at the November 7, 2006, special election in the form of a ballot title as follows, or as modified by the City Attorney pursuant to his duties under RCW 29A.36.071:
