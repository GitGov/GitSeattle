 WHEREAS, the City issued a competitive Request for Developer Qualifications / Proposals to solicit proposals for redevelopment of one or more of the Dearborn-Hiawatha Properties; and

 WHEREAS, in response to the Request for Developer Qualifications / Proposals, Artspace Projects, Inc. submitted a proposal dated May 6, 2004 to acquire Dearborn-Hiawatha Parcel 2c and construct a mixed use project containing rental units; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of the City's Office of Housing has determined that the Artspace Projects, Inc. proposal is complete and responsive to the Request for Developer Qualifications / Proposals, and recommends that ownership of Dearborn-Hiawatha Parcel 2c be transferred to Artspace Projects, Inc. or a designee approved by the Director;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Office of Housing ("Director") is authorized to enter into and perform an agreement ("Agreement") with Artspace Projects, Inc. ("Artspace") or to a designee of Artspace approved by the Director (Artspace and any approved designee, and any assignee of the Agreement approved by the Director, are referred to as "Purchaser"), for the transfer of the Property, legally described as:

 Commencing at the most Northerly corner of Lot 3, Block 3, "Rainier Boulevard Addition", according to the Plat thereof recorded in Volume 9 of Plats at page 59, in King County, Washington; Thence South 27 degrees 29'34" East, along the Northeasterly line of said Block 3, a distance of 260.33 feet to the true point of beginning; Thence continuing South 27 degrees 29'34" East, along said Northeasterly line, a distance of 219.98 feet to the most Easterly corner of Lot 14 of said Block 3; Thence South 62 degrees 27'56" West, along the Southeasterly line of said Lot 14, a distance of 97.94 feet; Thence North 27 degrees 29'34" West, along a line 2.00 feet Northeasterly of and parallel to the Southwesterly line common to Lots 2 through 14 of said Block 3, a distance of 219.99 feet; Thence North 62 degrees 27'56" East, a distance of 97.94 feet to the true point of beginning

 (the "Property") on the terms and subject to the conditions authorized in this ordinance. The Agreement shall be in the form attached to this ordinance as Attachment A, with such revisions and additions, not inconsistent with the express terms of this ordinance or with applicable law, as the Director may determine are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this ordinance. The stated sale price for the Property is $1,723,600. All except $28,470 shall be deferred under a non-recourse promissory note ("Note") in accordance with the Agreement, and Purchaser may earn forgiveness of up to the entire deferred portion, and interest thereon, through the provision of low- income housing, on the terms set forth in the Agreement. The terms of the Note, and for forgiveness thereof, shall be substantially as set forth in Attachment A except as they may be modified by written agreement based on a determination by the Director that, after review of the Purchaser's financing and operating plan and taking into account all subsidies and incentives from all sources for the Property, and the reasonable costs of developing the housing and maintaining long-term affordability, the terms in Attachment A are or may be more favorable than reasonably required in order for Purchaser to provide and maintain long-term affordable housing at the income and rent levels established under commitments to the City and other governmental entities. In order to carry out the Agreement for and on behalf of the City, the Director is authorized to execute a deed for the Property in substantially the form attached hereto as an Exhibit to the Agreement, and upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent under the Agreement, except for any that may be waived in writing by the Director, the Director is authorized to cause the deed to be recorded and delivered to the purchaser. The Director is authorized to execute, deliver, accept, record, modify, and administer such other documents, which may include amendments and extensions to the Agreement, and take such other actions, as she shall deem necessary or advisable to implement the purpose of this ordinance.

 Section 2. The Agreement shall require Purchaser to use diligent efforts to pursue design work, financing applications, environmental reports, permit applications and all other steps necessary to construct and permanently finance improvements on the Property as described in Section 3 of this ordinance. All such efforts of Purchaser shall be at its own expense and risk. The Agreement may provide interim deadlines as deemed appropriate by the Director, which may be extended in the discretion of the Director. The Agreement shall terminate if the conditions to transfer of the Property by the City are not satisfied within two (2) years of the effective date of this ordinance, except that one extension, not to exceed six (6) months, may be granted by the Director if in her judgment an extension furthers the City's objectives.

 Section 3. The improvements to be developed on the Property are to include:

 (a) at least 20 units of housing for very low-income households, with rents affordable to such households; and (b) at least 30 units of housing for 60% of median income households, with rents affordable to such households, all substantially as set forth in Section 3.03 of Attachment A. The housing, together with any additional improvements to be developed on the Property with the approval of the Director and all necessary regulatory approvals, are referred to in this ordinance as the "Project".

 Section 4. The City Council recognizes that the actual development capacity of the Property will depend upon the results of applicable regulatory processes and financial feasibility. If the Director determines that, because of regulatory, financial or other constraints, Purchaser will be unable to develop a project on the Property that includes both the minimum number of units for very low- income households and the minimum number of units for 60% of median income households, set forth in Section 3, then the Director may recommend to the City Council an alternative plan for the Property, which shall require approval by ordinance.

 Section 5. The Agreement shall provide for the transfer of the Property to Purchaser after the Director is satisfied that (1) Purchaser has obtained all necessary financing commitments for the construction and permanent financing of the Project as described in Section 3 of this ordinance; and (2) any other conditions in the Agreement, as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Director, are satisfied.

 Section 6. The Agreement, and the covenants to be recorded at closing of the transfer, shall prohibit any sale or other transfer of the Property prior to completion of the Project without the express written consent of the City, except for mortgages, deeds of trust, regulatory agreements and covenants for the purposes of the financing contemplated by the Agreement. The Agreement and such covenants shall not prohibit any transfer upon foreclosure of a deed of trust or mortgage approved by the Director, or in lieu of foreclosure thereof, or any subsequent transfer, but any transfer shall be subject to the requirements as to use of the Property set forth in the covenants. The Director may approve a transfer of the Property to a limited partnership or limited liability company managed by Artspace, or the designation by Artspace of such an entity as Purchaser, if the Director finds such a transfer or designation is necessary for the financing of the Project.

 Section 7. The Director is authorized to execute and deliver such additional documents, which may include amendments to the Agreement and related covenants, and to take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance, and to administer and enforce the Agreement, covenants, and any other such documents.

 Section 8. Payments made from escrow at closing, from funds deposited by or on behalf of the purchaser, of prorated assessments and other costs payable by the City at closing pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, shall be credited toward payment of the purchase price of the Property. All funds payable from escrow to the City shall be deposited in the Low-income Housing Fund (16400).

 Section 9. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Attachment A

 Hiawatha Parcel 2c PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

 This Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Agreement" or "Contract") is made as of _______________, 2005, by and between The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington (the "City" or "Seller"), and Artspace Projects, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Purchaser"), whose address is 250 Third Avenue North, Suite 500, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401.

 WHEREAS, the City obtained ownership of certain parcels known as the "Dearborn-Hiawatha Properties" from the State of Washington, Seattle Housing Authority, King County, and private owners; and

 WHEREAS, the City issued a competitive Request for Developer Qualifications/Proposals to solicit proposals for redevelopment of one or more Hiawatha parcels; and

 WHEREAS, in response to the Request for Developer Qualifications/Proposals, Artspace Projects, Inc. submitted a proposal dated May 6, 2004 to acquire Dearborn-Hiawatha Parcel 2C and construct rental units; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance ________, dated ___________, 2005, the Seattle City Council authorized the Director to execute, deliver and administer a real estate purchase and sale agreement, which is this Agreement; and

 Now, therefore, the parties hereto, for and in consideration of the promises and mutual obligations herein undertaken, do hereby agree as follows:

 PART I

 Section 1. Agreement to Convey Property

 Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the City agrees to sell and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to buy from the City, that certain real property located at 843 Hiawatha Place S. in the City of Seattle, commonly known as Parcel 2C of the Dearborn / Hiawatha Properties, and legally described on the attached Exhibit A (the "Property"), and generally located as shown on the map attached hereto as Exhibit B. Such map is attached solely for convenience of reference and does not qualify in any way the description of the Property, nor constitute or evidence any representation or warranty of any kind as to the Property dimensions or boundaries, or any other information shown thereon, it being the intent of the parties that the Purchaser assumes the risk of any discrepancies or inaccuracies in such map.

 Section 2. Purchase Price and Purchase Money Mortgage; Subordination; Conveyance

 2.01 Purchase Price; Purchase Money Note; Satisfaction Based on In- kind Benefits.

 (a) The total Purchase Price is $1,723,600. Purchaser shall, at Closing, deliver $28,470 in cash and a promissory note ("Purchase Money Note") in the amount of $1,695,130.

 (b) Except as may be otherwise agreed pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section:

 The Purchase Money Note shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. The interest rate on the Purchase Money Note shall be 1% per annum. If the Purchaser shall have complied fully with the terms of the Covenant described in Section 3.03 for 50 years after the date upon which the City Department of Planning and Development shall have issued a certificate of occupancy for all of the Improvements to be built pursuant to this Agreement (the "Completion Date"), and if the Purchase Money Note shall be extended beyond the fiftieth anniversary of the Completion Date, then (i) no further interest shall accrue so long as Purchaser continues to comply with the provisions of the Covenant that then remain in effect; and (ii) on each anniversary of the Completion Date beginning with the 51st such anniversary, so long as Purchaser continues to comply fully with the remaining applicable provisions of the Covenant, a portion of the total principal and interest outstanding, equal to 4% of such total as of such 50th anniversary, shall be deemed paid, until the entire Purchase Money Note is satisfied.

 (c) The purpose of the terms of the Purchase Money Note is to enable the Purchaser to provide long-term low-income housing at the Property, and not to permit the Purchaser to receive a windfall or to receive and retain substantial cash flow from the Property that would be available to pay installments on conventional terms of deferred payment land sales. The parties acknowledge that the Purchaser expects to use certain other public subsidies and tax incentives for the development of the Property, but the extent of available subsidies or incentives, as well as the actual costs of developing the Property in a manner consistent with regulatory and permit conditions and requirements, is not presently known. In addition, the terms of other subsidies or incentives may require commitments to serve tenants with lower incomes and to limit rents to levels lower than contemplated hereunder. Therefore, agreement by Purchaser to adjustments to the final terms of the Purchase Money Note and the terms on which performance may be accepted in lieu of cash thereunder may be required as a condition of this sale pursuant to Section 5.A.3 below.

 2.02 Purchase Money Documents.

 The "Purchase Money Documents" are the Purchase Money Note, the Purchase Money Mortgage, and any additional documents granted or delivered as security for the Purchase Money Note.

 2.03 Purchase Money Mortgage.

 (a) The Purchase Money Note shall be secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing on the Property granted by Purchaser, in form and content acceptable to Seller ("Purchase Money Mortgage"). The parties acknowledge that to complete the financing for the Project, the Purchaser intends to convey the Property to a limited liability company or limited partnership controlled by Purchaser ("Company"). If

 (1) the Purchaser is otherwise in full compliance with the terms of this Contract;

 (2) the Seller receives such title insurance or endorsements thereto as the Seller may require,

 then the Seller shall permit the conveyance of the Property to the Company, provided that the Company assumes all obligations of the Purchaser hereunder and subject to the prior satisfaction of any of the conditions of Section 5 below that the Seller shall have waived for purposes of Closing. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to permit such conveyance, Seller shall subordinate the lien of the Purchase Money Mortgage to the liens and covenants reasonably required for the Company's financing of the development of the Property as contemplated in this Contract with the sole exception of liens in favor of Purchaser or its affiliates. Seller acknowledges that the financing for the development of the Property is intended to include the financing identified on Exhibit E hereto, but the Seller does not hereby make any commitment or assurance that funding from the City will be provided.

 (b) Any obligation of the Seller to grant any subordination hereunder is conditioned upon the delivery to Seller, at least 30 days in advance of the date when Purchaser desires a subordination agreement to be delivered, of the proposed form of subordination agreement and all documents related to the liens or encumbrances to which subordination is requested, as well as documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Seller that the conditions to subordination are satisfied or will be satisfied as of the date of deliver and recording of the subordination agreement. In addition, any subordination may be conditioned upon such changes to the form of subordination agreement as the Seller may require, and the issuance to the Seller of one or more endorsements to the Seller's title insurance policy, as the Seller may require.

 2.04 Conveyance

 Upon (a) the payment of the sum provided in this Section 2 and all other amounts required to be paid by Purchaser at Closing hereunder, and (b) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the City shall convey the Property, by Quitclaim Deed in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Deed"), which is hereby approved as to form by Purchaser.

 Section 3. Purpose of Sale; Improvements; Low-Income Housing

 3.01 Purpose of Sale

 The intent of this sale is to enable the Purchaser promptly to construct a building and related improvements on the Property, consistent with this Contract and according to plans to be approved by the Seller. The improvements on the Property are to be used primarily as housing for low-income persons.

 3.02 Improvements

 The improvements to be developed on the Property shall include:

 3.03 Covenant

 As a condition of Seller's obligations at Closing, the Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge and deliver for recording a covenant ("Covenant") committing the use of the Property as follows:

 (a) At least 20 units of housing shall be rented to Very Low-Income households, with rents affordable to such households, for a minimum of 50 years; and

 (c) The Covenant shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.

 (d) The Covenant shall have priority over any monetary encumbrance on the Property and over any lease.

 (e) For purposes of this section:

 (1) a "Very Low-Income household" is a household with annual income, at the time of initial occupancy of a housing unit, at or below 50% of the Median Income;

 (2) a "60%-of-Median Income household" is a household with annual income, at the time of initial occupancy of a housing unit, at or below 60% of the Median Income;

 (3) "Median income" means annual median family income, as published from time to time by HUD, for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, or for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Division of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area, whichever is then generally used by HUD to establish income limits for federal programs, or such other area including Seattle as HUD may use from time to time for the purpose of publishing median income, and as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing. If, at any time, Median Income for a household size cannot be determined under the foregoing sentence based on data published by HUD for the Seattle area within the most recent thirteen months, then the City may determine "Median Income" for such household size based on any data for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion, adjusted for household size in such manner as the City shall determine in its sole discretion.

 (4) a unit is considered "affordable" (A) to a Very Low-Income household if the annual rent paid by the household, together with a reasonable allowance for utilities paid by the household, is no greater than 30% of the maximum annual income for a Very Low-Income household; and (B) to a 60%-of- Median Income household, if the annual rent paid by the household, together with a reasonable allowance for utilities paid by the household, is no greater than 30% of the maximum annual income for a 60%-of- Median Income household. For the purpose of determining affordability the presumed household size shall correspond to the size of unit as set forth below, regardless of the number of persons actually occupying the unit:

 Unit size Presumed household size Studio or SRO 1 person 1 bedroom 1.5 persons 2 bedrooms 3 persons 3 bedrooms 4.5 persons 4 bedrooms 6 persons

 (5) "HUD" means the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and any other department or agency that shall succeed to its functions with respect to low-income rental housing.

 Section 4. Title Insurance

 The City shall pay the cost of an ALTA Standard Coverage Owner's policy of title insurance for Purchaser, issued by Pacific Northwest Title Insurance Company, Inc. ("Title Company") in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Property, insuring Purchaser as the sole fee title holder as to the Property.

 Purchaser has reviewed a preliminary title commitment from the Title Company, Order no. ___________, dated ____________, 2005, as supplemented through supplement no. ____ dated _____________, 2005 (as so supplemented, the "Title Commitment," which is attached hereto as Exhibit G), along with all documents referenced in the Title Commitment. Any claims, liens, encumbrances and defects (collectively, "Permitted Exceptions") shown thereon are hereby approved and accepted by Purchaser, except for exceptions __________________ regarding _________________________. Prior to the date of closing, the City shall not further encumber the Property, or permit additional encumbrances to attach to the Property. Upon receiving notice of the Closing date from the Purchaser, the City shall provide at its expense title updates or supplements to the Purchaser to cover the period from the original Title Commitment up to a date one week prior to Closing. If title to the Property is not insurable on the date fixed for Closing free and clear of all liens, except for the Permitted Exceptions and any that may be created or suffered by Purchaser, then unless the Purchaser elects to accept the liens or the parties, by mutual written agreement, extend the date for Closing to allow the City or the Purchaser, to remove such liens, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, in which case the City shall return the Earnest Money to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Purchaser may obtain such additional title insurance coverage as Purchaser chooses, if Purchaser pays any difference in the cost between the standard coverage policy to be paid by the City and the increased premium due from any increase in the scope or amount of coverage or endorsements.

 Section 5. Conditions Precedent

Purchaser shall have obtained approval from the Director of the Office of Housing ("Director") for any changes to the Schematic Design (including the landscaping features), and the Construction Documents consistent with the Schematic Design shall have been submitted to the Director, as provided in Sections 302, 303, and 304.

If prior to Closing Purchaser or the City becomes aware of any change in the physical condition of the Property or any portion thereof after the date of this Agreement that would materially impair the feasibility of the project as contemplated hereunder or would substantially increase the hard construction costs of the Improvements (a "Changed Condition"), such party shall within ten (10) days of becoming aware of such Changed Condition, and in any event prior to Closing, notify the other party in writing of such Changed Condition.

 a) If the Changed Condition is caused by Purchaser or its agents, employees or contractors, Purchaser shall have the option to either restore the Property to its prior condition, complete its purchase of the Property hereunder, or both.

 b) If the Changed Condition is caused by the City or its agents, employees or contractors, the City shall at its discretion (i) restore the Property to its prior condition and reimburse Purchaser for Purchaser's damages caused by the Changed Condition or the City's restoration of the Property, or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and return the Earnest Money.

 c) If neither Purchaser nor the City is responsible for the Changed Condition, which may include, but shall not be limited to the discovery of pre-existing Hazardous Substances on the Property, then (i) if, within fifteen (15) days after the City sends or receives written notice of the Changed Condition, the City gives written notice to Purchaser that the City elects to remedy the Changed Condition, then this Agreement shall remain in effect and the City shall remedy the Changed Condition prior to Closing, or (ii) if the City does not give written notice of such election within said fifteen (15) days, then Purchaser shall have the option, by written notice to the City no later than fifteen (15) days after sending or receiving notice of the Changed Condition, either (A) to terminate this Agreement, in which case the City shall return the Earnest Money and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other under this agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement), or (B) to assume the risk of the Changed Condition and complete the purchase of the Property.

 3. Any written notice from Purchaser to the City hereunder that Purchaser is prepared to close the purchase of the Property shall constitute Purchaser's representation that it has re-inspected the Property and Purchaser's agreement to accept it in its condition on the date of such notice, whether or not such condition has changed from the date hereof.

 4. Together with any notice required under this paragraph, each party shall, to the extent they have not already done so, provide the other party with a copy of any reports or findings in its possession or control that disclose the Changed Condition or describe how such Changed Condition would in fact materially impair the development of the Property as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development.

 Section 203. Possession

 As between City and Purchaser, Purchaser's right to possession of the Property (subject to the rights of the City reserved in the Deed) shall be effective upon recording of the Deed.

 Section 204. Licenses for Entry

 The Purchaser acknowledges that it has been afforded the opportunity, directly and through its agents or contractors, to enter on the Property and perform certain tests, including soil borings. At any time and from time to time prior to Closing and prior to any termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser may request further access for Purchaser's employees, agents and contractors to the Property, for the purpose of conducting therein and thereon such inspections and studies as Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate with respect to evaluating its condition and designing the Improvements. Purchaser shall make any such request in writing at least 10 days prior to the first date when it desires such access and shall state the specific purposes for entry on the Property, the names of any agents or contractors involved, and the nature of any tests or other activities intended. The City will not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to such entry for purposes within the scope of this Section, provided that Purchaser, and its agents or contractors if applicable, agrees in writing to terms and conditions substantially as contained in the form of Permit attached as Exhibit I. Any such Permit shall state a limited period during which entry is authorized and the specific purposes for which entry is permitted. The covenants, releases and indemnities of Purchaser and any such other person in such Permit(s) shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the covenants, waivers and indemnities hereunder, and shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

 Section 205. Indemnification.

 Purchaser hereby agrees to release and forever discharge, indemnify, defend and hold the City, and its elected officials, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all liability, including without limitation any claims, liability, costs, damages or fees (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) incurred as a result of or in connection with Purchaser's entry onto any portion of the Property owned by the City, and including but not limited to Purchaser's release of any Hazardous Substances thereon, but only to the extent such liability does not arise from the actions of the City.

 The term "Hazardous Substances" shall mean any and all hazardous, toxic, infectious or radioactive substances, wastes or materials as defined or listed by any federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance pertaining to the protection of human health or the environment and shall specifically include petroleum oil and its fractions.

 SUBPART 300 - PLANS, APPROVALS, FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION

 Section 301. Community Meetings on Design

 If so requested by the Director, Purchaser agrees to attend one or more community meetings to present the architectural design and hear comments from neighboring residents and businesses, which comments shall not be binding upon Purchaser or require Purchaser to amend the design or other documents relating to the Improvements.

 Section 302. Schematic Design, Approval of Schematic Design by the Director

 Purchaser has prepared and the Director has approved plans and drawings, attached hereto as Exhibit H (collectively, the "Schematic Design") in sufficient detail with respect to development of the Property to clearly describe the site plan, architectural character, circulation, landscaping features and relationship to the surrounding environment of the Improvements.

 Section 303. Construction Documents

 Purchaser shall use diligent efforts to pursue design work, financing applications, environmental reports, permit applications and all other steps necessary to construct and permanently finance the Improvements on the Property. Purchaser shall prepare plans and specifications with respect to the construction of the Improvements (the "Construction Documents") substantially consistent with the approved Schematic Design and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Construction Documents shall be sufficiently complete and detailed to satisfy requirements pertinent to application for a building permit to DPD but also to demonstrate to the Director that the Improvements will be in accordance with the previously approved Schematic Design.

 Purchaser shall submit the Construction Documents, together with a construction or progress schedule, to the Director at the same time as Purchaser submits the Construction Documents to DPD. Purchaser may submit Construction Documents to the Director at any time following the City's approval of the Schematic Design. In any event Purchaser shall submit Construction Documents to the Director within 12 months following execution of this Agreement.

 Section 304. Changes in Schematic Design or Construction Documents

 Purchaser shall notify the Director not less often than bimonthly (every two months) of any material changes in the size, character, design, or exterior surface of structures or in the site plan, exterior elevation or materials as set forth in the Schematic Design and Construction Documents or either of them after approval of the Schematic Design by the City. The Director shall have ten (10) business days after receipt of such notice to provide Purchaser with written objection to any such changes. Such written notice shall contain a statement of the specific reasons for such rejection. Purchaser may within thirty (30) days after receiving Director's written notice of objection, submit a revision of the proposed changes, which shall be subject to the timely review described in Section 306 of this Agreement, unless the revisions are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the approved Schematic Design. If in the Director's judgment the revised proposed changes satisfy the Director's objections stated in the Director's prior written notice of rejection or otherwise satisfy the criteria set forth above, the Director shall approve the revised proposed changes and evidence her approval by endorsement of the same on the revised plan sheets and by notifying the Purchaser.

 If the revised proposed changes do not satisfy the Director's written objections or the criteria set forth above, the Director may reject the revised proposed changes and if the Closing shall not have occurred, then the City may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and the Escrow Agent, in which case the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City. In such case the Earnest Money is intended as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, and together shall be City's sole and exclusive remedy, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 305. Permits

 As a condition precedent to the City's obligation to sell the Property to the Purchaser, a Master Use Permit for the development of the Property consistent with the Schematic Design (as the same may have been modified with the consent of the City hereunder) and the grading permit needed to commence construction of the Improvements must be issued by DPD, or DPD must have given notice that such permits are ready to issue.

 Section 306. Timely Review of Changes in Design or Plans

 If, with respect to any transmittal or submission of any changes to the Schematic Design or Construction Documents, Director does not give Purchaser written notice of her objection thereto and reasons therefor within ten (10) business days of receiving such documents, then if the first page of the transmittal conspicuously stated the effect of this Section with express reference hereto, the documents as transmitted to the Director shall be deemed approved, unless the changes are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the previously approved Schematic Design.

 Section 307. Financing Commitment

 Purchaser represents that Purchaser will use its best efforts to obtain an allocation of low income housing tax credits and financing commitment ("Financing Commitment") from one or more lending entities (individually and collectively, the "Lender(s)") to finance the construction of the Improvements to be built on the Property.

 As a condition precedent to the City's obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall provide to the Office of Housing financing commitments from the Lender(s) and evidence of receiving an allocation of low income housing tax credits, that together demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director that Purchaser will obtain all financing necessary to complete the Improvements in accordance with this Agreement, the Schematic Design and the Construction Documents, permanently to finance the Improvements, and that no term of any Financing Commitment is in material conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Schematic Design, or the Construction Documents.

 Section 308. Permits

 The City acknowledges that the redevelopment of the Property and the requirements of this Agreement necessitate that Purchaser apply for and obtain certain permits and other similar authorizations (collectively, the "Permits") from the City and other governmental agencies relating to the Property and the Improvements prior to Purchaser obtaining fee title to the Property. The term "Permits" shall include without limitation use permits; building permits; short plats and lot boundary adjustments and other similar authorizations and approvals; grading permits; shoring permits; permits for work in public rights-of-way; and utility permits.

 Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require that the City exercise its discretionary authority under its regulatory ordinances to further the development of the Property, nor binds the City to do so. The City will process applications for Permits as if such applications were made in the absence of this Agreement. Purchaser assumes the risk of inability to obtain any such approvals, consents, or permits, for any reason. No consent, approval or requirement contained in or made by the Director of Housing or her designees pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute the approval, consent, or Permit required for any regulatory or other City purpose, nor require the City to grant any such approval, consent, or Permit. No regulatory requirement, condition or recommendation related to any Permit shall constitute approval for any change in the Schematic Design or for any Construction Plans or changes therein, nor obligate the Director of Housing to grant any such approval.

 PART III - GENERAL

 SUBPART 400 - REGULATORY CONDITIONS

 Section 401. Non-Discrimination; Fair Contracting Practices

 The Purchaser shall not create barriers to open and fair opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses ("WMBEs ") to participate in contracts and to obtain or compete for contracts and subcontracts as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services related to the development of the Property. In considering offers from and doing business with contractors and suppliers, the Purchaser shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, age, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation or the presence of any mental or physical disability in an otherwise qualified disabled person.

 Each party is required to comply with the Fair Contracting Practices Ordinance of the City of Seattle (Ordinance 119601), as amended. Conduct made unlawful by that ordinance constitutes a breach of contract. Engaging in an unfair contracting practice may also result in the imposition of a civil fine or forfeiture under the Seattle Criminal Code as well as various civil remedies.

 SUBPART 500 - PURPOSE OF PURCHASE; PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

 Section 501. Improvements

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Property is for the purpose of immediate development of a residential complex with 1st floor commercial space as shown in the Schematic Design and not for speculation in land holding.

 Section 502. Transfer of Property and Assignment of Agreement

 Prior to Closing, Purchaser shall not transfer this Agreement or any interest herein without the express written consent of the City, and the City shall not be required to recognize any rights of any assignee to which it has not given express written consent. If the Purchaser shall satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 307, then the City will not unreasonably withhold its consent to the assignment of Purchaser's rights and obligations under this Agreement to a limited liability company of which the Purchaser is the managing member or limited partnership of which the Purchaser is the general partner, provided that such transfer is necessary for the purpose of financing the Improvements and such entity assumes all such obligations by delivering an agreement satisfactory to the City.

 In the absence of a specific written agreement by the City to the contrary, no transfer or consent thereto by the City shall relieve Purchaser, or any other party bound in any way by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the construction of the Improvements, from any of its obligations with respect thereto. Purchaser shall not transfer title to the Property prior to completion of the Improvements without the express written consent of the City. This Section shall not prohibit any transfer upon foreclosure of a deed of trust or mortgage approved by the Director, or in lieu of foreclosure thereof, or any subsequent transfer, but any transfer shall be subject to the requirements as to use of the Property set forth in the Covenant.

 SUBPART 700 - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 Section 701. Default

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of any default in or breach of this Agreement, or any of its terms or conditions, by any party hereto, or any successor to a party, such party (or successor) shall, upon written notice from the other, proceed immediately to cure or remedy such default or breach, and, in any event, shall complete such cure within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice or such shorter period as may be provided herein. In case such action is not taken or not diligently pursued, or the default or breach shall not be cured or remedied within the time permitted hereunder, the aggrieved party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the specific limitations herein. This Section shall not affect the operation of Section 702 or 703 below, nor require any notice or opportunity to cure prior to exercise of remedies under those Sections.

 Section 702. Remedies Upon Default of City

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event that any of the following occurs:

 a) The City fails to tender conveyance of the Property or otherwise close on the Property in the manner required herein after satisfaction of the conditions provided in this Agreement and receipt of a notice to close from Purchaser as specified herein, and any such failure shall not be cured within sixty (60) days after notice from the Purchaser; or

 b) The Director of the Office of Housing fails or refuses to approve of Purchaser's Construction Documents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without providing a written explanation for such refusal, and such failure or refusal is not cured within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof; or

 c) The City otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the terms and conditions of or is in default or breach of this Agreement prior to Closing, and does not cure such breach within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof;

 then at the option of Purchaser this Agreement shall be terminated, upon written notice to the City of such termination, the City shall surrender the Earnest Money to the Purchaser and Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole remedy, to proceed against the City for actual damages, limited to out-of-pocket costs directly related to development of the Property, not to exceed $5,000. Such termination, recovery of Earnest Money and proceeding for such damages shall be Purchaser's only remedies for breach or default by the City at or prior to Closing. As used herein, the term "out-of-pocket costs" excludes administrative or overhead costs, legal fees to the extent not incurred as part of the financing and development of the project, and also excludes consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, such as but without limitation lost profits, lost business opportunities or interference with business or contractual expectancies.

 Section 703. Remedies Upon Default of Purchaser

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event that prior to the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser, any of the following occurs:

 (a) Purchaser (or any successor in interest) assigns or attempts to assign this Agreement or any rights therein or in the Property without the express consent of the City; or

 (b) Purchaser does not submit Construction Documents acceptable to the Director as required by this Agreement or obtain the permits necessary to allow construction, in each case, in the manner and by the dates respectively provided in this Agreement; or

 (c) Purchaser, without legal excuse, gives notice that it will be unable or unwilling to close on the Property provided herein; or

 (d) Purchaser, without legal excuse, does not tender the full consideration for and take title to the Property and perform all other obligations of Purchaser on or before the working day before the date set for Closing hereunder; or

 (e) Purchaser, without legal excuse, otherwise fails to comply with the terms of or is in default or breach of this Agreement prior to Closing and does not cure such breach within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof;

 then at the option of the City this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser or of any assignee or transferee in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the City or the Property shall be terminated upon receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such termination, the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City. The Earnest Money is intended as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, and together shall be City's sole and exclusive remedy for a default of Purchaser prior to Closing, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 704. Other Rights and Remedies; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies, subject to express limits herein. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact and in writing made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.

For value received, ARTSPACE PROJECTS, INC., a Minnesota corporation (hereinafter referred to as "Maker"), promises to pay in lawful money of the United States of America, to the order of THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a Washington municipal corporation, at 700 Fifth Avenue, Suite 5700, Post Office Box 94725, Seattle, WA 98124-4725, or such other place as the holder of this Note may designate in writing from time to time, the principal sum of One Million, Six Hundred Ninety-Five Thousand, One Hundred Thirty Dollars and no cents ($1,695,130.00), with interest as set forth herein.

 2) Contract for Sale; Covenant. This Note is made pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of ________________, 2005 between the Maker and the named payee ("Contract"), to evidence the unpaid purchase price of certain real property on Hiawatha Place in Seattle, Washington. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Contract unless the context otherwise clearly requires. Pursuant to the Contract the Maker has executed a Covenant dated as of the date hereof recorded against such property ("Covenant").

 3) Maturity; Extension. The principal amount of this Note, accrued interest, and all other amounts owing hereunder, unless earlier accelerated under the terms of this Note or any documents securing this Note, are due and payable as follows: (a) on _________________________, if a Certificate of Occupancy for the Improvements ("Certificate of Occupancy") then shall not have been issued by the Seattle Department of Planning and Development; and (b) otherwise, on the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the date of issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy for the Improvements (the date when the outstanding principal balance becomes due under clause (a) or (b), as it may be extended under this Section, is referred to as the "Maturity Date"). If the Property has not been sold or otherwise transferred prior to the Maturity Date, and this Note has not otherwise been accelerated, the Maturity Date shall, at Maker's request in writing made not more than sixty (60) and not less than thirty (30) days before the Maturity Date, be extended for twenty-five (25) years.

 4) Satisfaction by Nonfinancial Performance. If this Note shall be extended pursuant to Section 3 above, then amounts owing under this Note may be satisfied by nonfinancial performance beginning on the fifty-first (51st) anniversary date of the date of issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy under the terms, and subject to the conditions, stated in Section 2.01 of the Contract.

 5) Interest Rate; Forgiveness of interest. Maker shall pay interest on the outstanding principal of this Note at the rate of 1% per annum from the date hereof. All interest shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the principal balance shall be declared due. If the Maturity Date shall be extended pursuant to Section 3 above, then so long as Maker is in compliance with the Covenant and the principal balance hereunder shall not have been accelerated, no further interest shall accrue. Any amounts past due hereunder, including accrued interest, shall bear interest at 12% per annum or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever shall be less.

 6) Default and Acceleration. Any default under the Contract, the Covenant or the Deed of Trust securing this Note shall constitute a default under this Note, and upon such default the holder of this Note shall have the right, without notice or demand, to declare all amounts owing hereunder immediately due and payable. This Section applies to a default by any successors in interest to the Maker of this Note with respect to any of the Property (as defined in the Covenant), whether or not the Maker shall have caused or permitted such default and whether or not the transfer to such successor shall have been approved or permitted by the holder hereof.

 7) Prepayment. The principal amount of this Note may be prepaid in full or in part at any time.

 8) Costs and Attorneys' Fees. In case Maker defaults in payment of this Note, Maker agrees to pay all of the holder's costs of collection, including but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the holder of this Note whether or not suit is instituted. If any legal proceedings are instituted relating to this Note, including without limitation any arbitration, bankruptcy, trial or appellate proceedings, Maker shall pay the holder's costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, in all such proceedings.

 9) Waivers. Maker hereby waives presentment, demand for payment and notice of dishonor. The holder of this Note may forgo or delay enforcing any rights or remedies under this Note without losing them.

Grantee acknowledges that adverse physical, economic or other conditions (including without limitation, adverse environmental soils and ground-water conditions), either latent or patent, may exist on the Property and assumes Grantor's responsibility for all environmental conditions of the Property, known or unknown, including but not limited to responsibility, if any, for investigation, removal or remediation actions relating to the presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance or other environmental contamination relating to the Property. Grantee also releases, covenants not to sue, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Grantor and its past, present and future officials, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties, fees, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to fees and costs of regulatory agencies, attorneys, contractors and consultants), and liabilities arising out of, or in any way connected with, the condition of the Property including but not limited to any alleged or actual past, present or future presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property, or any portion thereof or improvement thereon, from any cause whatsoever; it being intended that Grantee shall so indemnify Grantor and such personnel without regard to any fault or responsibility of Grantor or Grantee. Grantee is aware of the rights it might otherwise have to seek recovery from Grantor for costs of remediation and cleanup of Hazardous Substances under applicable law, including without limitation the Washington Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA") and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and Grantee hereby knowingly waives all such rights, now existing or hereafter arising, and voluntarily relinquishes those rights and forever releases the Grantor from any such obligation. The obligation to complete all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of the Property and the acknowledgements, releases, and covenants herein touch and concern the Property, are intended to run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and assigns.

 Grantee's release and covenant not to sue shall include both claims by Grantee as original plaintiff against Grantor and any cross-claims, third-party claims or other claims against Grantor by Grantee based upon claims made against Grantee by any third parties. The obligation to

 indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action costs and natural resources damages claims. This Covenant means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-is, where-is and with-all-faults," and that Grantee assumes all responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any environmental conditions on the Property and has no recourse against Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or liability with respect to the Property. This Covenant shall apply regardless of whether or not Grantee is culpable, negligent or in violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation. Nothing herein shall release, discharge or affect any rights or causes of action that Grantor or Grantee may have against any other person or entity, except as otherwise expressly stated herein, and each of the parties reserves all such rights including, but not limited to, claims for contribution or cost recovery relating to any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property.

 Nondiscrimination. Grantee further covenants that there shall be no discrimination upon the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in the sale, lease or rental, or in the use or occupancy, of the Property or any improvements erected or to be erected thereon. Both the Grantor and the United States of America shall be entitled to enforce this paragraph, which shall run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns.

 The terms of this Covenant are in addition to, and not in substitution for, those terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated ______________, 2005 between Grantor and Grantee (the "Contract") that, by the terms of such Contract, survive the delivery of this deed.

 Condition Subsequent / Power of Termination. This conveyance is subject to the following condition and power of termination which shall be binding on the Grantee and its successors and assigns, and to which Grantee agrees on behalf of Grantee and its successors and assigns:

 1. Condition Subsequent. This Deed and all rights of Grantee hereunder are subject to a condition subsequent upon the occurrence of which Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns shall have the absolute right, subject only to the express limitations set forth herein, to terminate, by notice to Grantee or by reentering and taking possession of the Property, the estate conveyed under this deed and all rights of all persons claiming by or through Grantee, whereupon fee simple title to the Property shall revest entirely in Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns. The condition subsequent shall have occurred unless the following shall have occurred on or before ___________: Grantee shall have obtained from the Seattle Department of Planning and Development ("DPD") the Certificate of Occupancy for the Property consistent with the Schematic Design and Summary Description.

 2. Certificate of Compliance. Upon recording of a Certificate of Compliance duly signed by the Director of the Office of Housing of the Grantor, stating that the Grantee has timely satisfied the above requirement such that the condition subsequent cannot occur, or that if such requirements have not been timely satisfied they have been waived by the City, the condition subsequent in this deed shall be of no further force or effect.

If, at any time, Median Income for a household size cannot be determined under the foregoing sentence based on data published by HUD for the Seattle area within the most recent thirteen months, then the City may determine "Median Income" for such household size based on any data for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion, adjusted for household size in such manner as the City shall determine in its sole discretion.

In any event the Owner shall not sell, lease, or otherwise transfer ownership, possession or control of (i) the entire Property; or (ii) more than one residential unit to the same transferee without the express written consent of the City.

No forbearance or delay by the City in enforcement of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver, nor in any way impair the rights or remedies of the City hereunder, and if any waiver shall be granted with respect to any instance of noncompliance with the terms hereof, such waiver shall not affect the right of the City to require compliance will all terms hereof in the future. Any consent of the City required hereunder shall be valid only if given by the Director of Housing or his or her designee expressly for the purposes of this Agreement, and no consent given for purposes of this Agreement shall be construed as a consent, permit, or approval for purposes of any other contract or instrument, nor for purposes of any law, ordinance, regulation or permit.

 7. Governing Law; Venue

 This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington. Owner, for itself and its successors and assigns, consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Washington and to venue of any proceedings brought hereunder in King County, Washington.

 8. Severability

 If any provision of this agreement, or the application thereof to any conditions or circumstances, shall be found to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties intend that the validity or enforceability of the other provisions, or of such provision as applied to other conditions or circumstances, as the case may be, shall not be impaired.

 9. Reporting

 Owner shall make annual certifications to the City that it is in compliance with the housing provisions of this Agreement and shall provide annual audited financial statements for the operation of the housing, including a statement of revenues and expenses for the operation of the housing units and a statement of assets and liabilities of the owner of the housing unit as of the end of the calendar year, in each case certified by an officer of such owner and including the auditor's report. Such certifications and the financial statements for the most recently ended year shall be submitted by June 30 of each year and shall include the most current rent schedule (showing which units are those maintained for extremely low-income households and, if there be more than a total of 32 units, which ones are maintained for extremely low-income households); the income and household size of each tenant household; a calculation justifying any increases in rents from the previous rent schedule, consistent with this Agreement, and the actual rents being charged to each tenant household.
