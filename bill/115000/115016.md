 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing Seattle Public Utilities to continue participating in environmental investigation and remediation of the Gas Works Sediment Site; to enter into an Agreed Order with the Washington State Department of Ecology and Puget Sound Energy, Inc.; to enter into an interim cost-sharing agreement with Puget Sound Energy, Inc.; and to seek and accept state Remedial Action Grants or other grant funds for work related to the MTCA site.

 WHEREAS, on March 29, 2002, the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) named the City of Seattle, along with Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE), as a "Potentially Liable Person" (PLP) for the release of hazardous substances to the Lake Union sediments adjacent to Gas Works Park (Gas Works Sediment Site) under the Washington State Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), Chapter 70.105D RCW; and

 WHEREAS, the City and PSE were previously named Potentially Liable Persons for the release of hazardous substances to the Gas Works Park uplands property, and both parties entered into an Agreed Order with Ecology in 1997 followed by a Consent Decree in 1999 (King County Superior Court Cause No. 99-2-52532-9SEA), under which agreements hazardous substances on the uplands property were investigated and remediated, and hazardous substances in the sediments offshore of the Park were expressly excluded; and

 WHEREAS, the Gas Works Park uplands property as described in the 1999 Consent Decree includes Gas Works Park, a City of Seattle public park, and the Seattle Harbor Patrol property, used for the Seattle Police Department's Harbor Patrol; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, under the lead of the Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), and PSE have nearly completed negotiations with Ecology regarding the terms of an Agreed Order for a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to investigate contamination in the sediments adjacent to the uplands property which is associated with historical gas manufacturing, tar refining and other activities on the uplands property, and to identify options for remediation; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor's Office designated SPU as the lead department to negotiate a coordinated approach on behalf of other involved city departments; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and PSE have nearly completed negotiations with PSE on a Memorandum of Agreement to implement a joint approach to conducting the RI/FS for the Gas Works Sediment Site and an interim cost-sharing arrangement for that work; and

 WHEREAS the work to be performed under the Agreed Order and the agreement with PSE is ongoing and currently expected to continue beyond the current budget cycle; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, as a public agency, may apply for state grants under the authority of the Model Toxic Control Act to pay for 50% of its costs for some of the activities associated with the Gas Works sediments site; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, under the lead of SPU, is researching whether other parties may be viable potentially liable parties under MTCA because those parties that have contributed to the contamination should be required to pay their fair share of the resulting costs; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to continue participating in the investigation and remediation of contamination at the Gas Works Sediment Site on behalf of all City Departments.

 Section 2. Seattle Public Utilities is further authorized to enter into an Agreed Order with the Washington State Department of Ecology and Puget Sound Energy, Inc. to undertake a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) at the Gas Works Sediment Site.

 Section 3. Prior to beginning negotiations with the Department of Ecology regarding any studies or activities at the Gas Works Sediment Site that would be performed under new Agreed Orders or under a Consent Decree, the Executive shall provide the Council with information on the proposed scope and parameters of the negotiations, along with potential costs, risks, alternatives and strategies, including strategies for sharing costs or seeking contribution toward costs from other potentially liable persons. If the Council adopts a resolution authorizing negotiations, then the Executive may proceed in accordance with the Council's resolution.

 Section 4. Seattle Public Utilities is also authorized to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with Puget Sound Energy that provides an agreed approach for cooperatively performing the RI/FS at the Gas Works Sediment Site and that provides for interim cost-sharing. For future agreements with Puget Sound Energy or any other party that make a final allocation of investigation or remediation costs at the Gas Works Sediment Site between the City of Seattle and those parties, or that agree to a binding process to allocate costs, the Executive shall brief the Council and shall submit any recommended agreement to the Council and the Council shall authorize or deny authorization for the Executive to execute the agreement.

 Section 5. Seattle Public Utilities is also authorized to seek and to accept Remedial Action Grants from the Washington State Department of Ecology or grants from other organizations for work related to the Gas Works Sediment Site, including the RI/FS studies, any interim actions and source control efforts.

 Section 6. In order to exercise the authority provided by this ordinance, Seattle Public Utilities may make commitments regarding the RI/FS at the Gas Works Sediment Site that will require funding beyond the current budget cycle.

 Section 7. Seattle Public Utilities is authorized, but not required, to fund its commitments by amortizing the costs over time and including the amortized costs in the applicable utility rates.

 Section 8. Seattle Public Utilities shall include the Gas Works Sediment Site in SPU's annual CIP budgets. Quarterly reports to the Council shall show the amount budgeted for the site in the current year, expenditures to date, and the year-end projected expenditures.

In addition, the leader of the Executive team for the Gas Works Sediment Site and the Assistant City Attorney assigned to that project shall confer as appropriate with the Chair of the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee and of the Utilities and Technology Committee, and with other Councilmembers and Council Central Staff, regarding significant strategic, policy, or budgetary issues.
