 B. On November 30, 2005, the Owner submitted to the City of Seattle an application for a contract rezone from Lowrise/Duplex/Triplex (LDT) to Neighborhood Commercial 1 with a 40' height limit (NC1-40). The purpose of the application is to allow the Property to be used for more intense mixed-use, commercial and multi-family, residential development.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to 23.34.004, the Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitation and condition in consideration of the rezone of the Property from LDT to NC1-40:

 Future development of the Property shall be restricted to a structure with non-residential uses at street level and residential uses above street level.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone shall expire two (2) years from the effective date of approval, unless, within the two (2) year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit, which permit is subsequently issued.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owner and the City; provided, such amendment shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner or its successor avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the Lowrise/Duplex/Triplex zone.
