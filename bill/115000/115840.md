 AN ORDINANCE relating to neighborhood fire stations; removing eight budget provisos that restricted expenditures in the Fleets and Facilities Department's 2007 budget.

 WHEREAS, the citizens of the City of Seattle approved the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy on November 4, 2003 in order to seismically upgrade, renovate and replace emergency facilities including 32 neighborhood fire stations; and,

 WHEREAS, unprecedented escalation in construction costs after 2003 has increased the costs of improving neighborhood fire stations by $67 million as identified in the Neighborhood Fire Station Financial Update written by the Fleets and Facilities Department in January 2006; and,

 WHEREAS, in order to reduce the costs of the neighborhood station program, the City Council commissioned a consultant report to recommend reductions in the scope of the neighborhood fire station projects that are cost-effective and would not have a negative impact on fire protection and emergency medical services; and,

 WHEREAS, the Mayor proposed a 2007-2012 Capital Improvement Program that provides an additional $67 million from Real Estate Excise Tax revenues in order to build the neighborhood fire station improvements identified as part of the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy; and,

 WHEREAS, the City Council, in approving the 2007-2012 Capital Improvement Program and the 2007 Budget, wanted to consider the report of its consultant before allowing the design of the eight neighborhood fire station projects that begin in 2007, and appropriated the funds in the amounts proposed with provisos that no more than $150,000 could be spent on each of these eight neighborhood fire station projects until such time as the Council passes an ordinance approving the spending of the remaining appropriated funds; and,

 WHEREAS, the eight fire stations affected by this spending limit are Fire Stations #14 (SODO), #33 (Rainer Beach), #30 (Mount Baker), #35 (Crown Hill), #37 (High Point), #38 (Ravenna/Bryant), #39 (Lake City), and #41 (Magnolia); and,

 WHEREAS, the Council's consultant did not recommend reductions in scope and the Council directs the Fleets and Facilities Department to proceed expeditiously with the neighborhood fire station projects; NOW, THEREFORE,
