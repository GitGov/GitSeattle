 WHEREAS, Section 4.36.193 of the Seattle Municipal Code was last amended in 1995; and

 WHEREAS, it is necessary to amend to Section 4.36.193 to reflect changes to the Internal Revenue Code's direct rollover requirements made by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA"), effective for distributions occurring after December 31, 2001, based on model language published by the Internal Revenue Service;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 4.36.193 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.193 Election to rollover to an eligible retirement plan.

 Notwithstanding any provision of the City Employee's Retirement System to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board of Administration to have any portion of any eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.

 The following definitions apply to this Section:

 A. Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income ~~(determined without regard to the exclusion, for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities~~unless it is paid to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.

 B. Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,~~and~~an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.~~However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.~~

 C. Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

 D. Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

 Section 2. The City's Code Reviser is authorized and directed to amend the Seattle Municipal Code accordingly.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
