 This ongoing project resurfaces asphalt and concrete arterial streets. The Department uses a pavement management system to track the condition of arterial street pavement, to develop maintenance needs and establish priorities, and to select the streets to be rehabilitated each year. Project selection for 2007 is completed early in 2007. Potential streets to be paved in 2007 include Denny Way from 1st Avenue North to 9th Avenue North, Dexter Avenue from Denny Way to Mercer Avenue, Mercer Avenue from Queen Anne Avenue North to 5th Avenue North, SW Roxbury from 35th Avenue SW to Delridge Way SW, Westlake from Olive Way to Denny Way, Boren Avenue from Broadway to Denny Way, Madison Avenue from Terry Avenue to 18th Avenue East, Broadway from Yesler Avenue to East Pine Street, and Seneca Street from Boren to East Union. The 2007 Budget Request includes $12.8 million from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.

 This project will analyze the remaining 65 bridges that were not retrofitted during Phase 1 Seismic Retrofit. The project will also complete partial retrofits that were part of Phase 1. The project will prioritize the bridges based on traffic importance and seismic vulnerability. On the highest ranked bridges, conceptual level analysis will be performed to develop a retrofit strategy and cost estimate. As funding allows, full retrofit design and construction will follow. Funding for 2007-2012 will be provided by the 20-year levy lid lift in the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.

 The project provides low-cost non-capital revisions to hazardous street locations. Annual collisions are reviewed at intersections and at mid-block locations. Locations with five or more annual vehicle collisions are checked for collision patterns. Revisions can include removal, relocation or shielding of fixed objects, improved signage, improved delineation with raised islands, or striping. Projects are selected, designed, and managed by Traffic Management staff. In 2007, an additional $46,000 is available in Levy Lid Lift funds as part of the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.

 This ongoing project improves 5-10 left-turn signals each year at locations with high left-turn collision occurrences. The Department established this project in 1992 to reduce accidents and meet state regulatory requirements. Locations are selected based on accident data. In 2006, left turn signals were installed at Aurora Ave. N. & Winona Ave., 15th Ave. S.W. and S.W. Roxbury St., Broadway and Pine, 4th Ave. & Industrial Way S., Rainier Ave. S. & S. Genesee, and Beacon Ave. S. & S. McClellan St. In 2007, there is an additional $92,000 of Levy LID Lift funds budgeted for this project. The funds are tied to the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.

 This ongoing project installs new traffic signals to improve traffic flow, reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents, and support pedestrian activity. Since 1988, the City has installed about 10 signals per year at selected locations where drainage, curb revisions, or pavement restoration were not required. At the current level of funding, the City is installing five or fewer signals per year for a total of 3-5 signals installed per year. Location choices are based upon pedestrian and vehicle volumes; school, senior citizen, and handicapped accessible crossing requirements; and accident frequency criteria. The program provides a match to State High-Hazard funds for new signals. In 2005, Ordinance 121796 appropriated $500,000 in REET II funds to pay for traffic signals. This supplemental appropriation is reflected in the fund table below. In 2007, an additional $277,000 of Levy Lid Lift funding is included in the project. This funding is part of the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.
