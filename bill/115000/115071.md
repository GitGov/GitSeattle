 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.35.060, as last amended by Ordinance 120985, is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 3.35.060 Garden plot fee schedule; permits

 A. To partially offset the costs of the P-Patch program, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods ("Director") is authorized to establish and collect fees for applications for, and for the use of, P-Patch garden plots and to grant revocable permits for such use. Fees shall include an application fee and a permit fee. The permit fee shall vary in accordance with the size of garden plot used by the program participant and shall generally be based on a standard unit of one hundred square feet. Beginning January 1, 2005~~2004~~, the base application fee shall be Twenty-one~~Twenty~~ Dollars ($21)~~($20)~~ per year for any size plot, and the base permit fee shall be Ten Dollars ($10) per year for each standard unit or any part of a standard unit. These ~~initial~~ base fees shall be subject to adjustments as authorized in subsections B, C and D of this section. The Director may waive fees and allow reductions from base fees as authorized in subsections E and F of this section.

 B. The Director shall adjust the base fees every two (2) years approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, published by the federal government, or a substitute or successor index selected by the Director. The ~~first~~next such adjustment shall take effect January 1, 200~~5~~7.

 C. The Director also may increase base fees for any year to reflect actual or expected increases in operating costs, including but not limited to water, lease fees, or equipment maintenance, provided that neither the base application fee nor the base permit fee for a standard unit shall vary by more than five per cent (5%) from the respective fee that would apply under subsections A and B of this section.

 D. The Director may establish reduced base application fees or base permit fees, or both, for plots substantially smaller than a standard unit, including accessible raised beds, so long as the total base fees per square foot are no less than an amount generally consistent with the total base fees per square foot for the standard unit.

 E. The Director may accept a reduced permit fee from a participant who is given access to a plot after a significant portion of the growing season has expired, prorated to reflect the number of months remaining in the growing season.

 F. The Director may waive application fees or permit fees, or both, or set reduced fees, for plots used by low-income persons, and for organizations using plots dedicated to food bank gardening, otherwise operated to benefit low-income persons, or dedicated to educational purposes. If the Director waives or reduces fees under this section, the Director shall adopt policies regarding the income levels eligible for waivers or reduced fees, the types of organizations and programs eligible for such waivers or reductions, and conditions of eligibility, consistent with the intended public purposes for such waivers and reductions. The Director may limit the amount of area for which specified waivers or reductions may be allowed in order to prevent undue impacts on the revenues of the program.

 Section 2. Nothing in this ordinance shall affect P-Patch fees for periods ending earlier than January 1, 2005. Subject to the foregoing, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
