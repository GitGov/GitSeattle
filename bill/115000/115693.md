 SHORT LEGAL: SECTION 1-22-5 ASSESSOR'S PROPERTY TAX PARCEL: 012205-9006

 SUBSTATION EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 This Substation Easement Agreement ("Substation Easement") is made this ___ day of _________, 200____ ("Effective Date"), by and between The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through Seattle Public Utilities (the "City" or "Grantor") and Puget Sound Energy, Inc., a corporation of the State of Washington ("PSE" or "Grantee").

 RECITALS

 A. The City owns certain real property in unincorporated King County, Washington, commonly referred to as the Lake Youngs Reservation (as shown in Attachment 1, the "Property").

 B. The City is constructing a water treatment facility on the Property, which facility requires primary voltage electric service.

 C. In the Installation and Service Agreement dated as of August 1, 2003 (the "I&S Agreement") between the City and PSE, the parties agreed that it would be most efficient and effective for both parties if PSE were to provide the required electric service through a substation located on the Property (as hereinafter further defined, the "Substation").

 D. Pursuant to a Temporary Construction Permit dated August 1, 2003 between the City and PSE, PSE has constructed and installed the Substation and certain electrical and communication facilities described in said permit.

 E. Prior to the date hereof, each of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Seattle City Council has authorized, approved or otherwise accepted without change or condition unacceptable to PSE or City, all documents required to be submitted (including this Substation Easement) to the applicable entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by the I&S Agreement.

 F. In accordance with the I&S Agreement, the City and PSE, on even date herewith, have entered into an Electrical and Communication Facility Easement Agreement with respect to electrical equipment and fiber optic communication facilities used in connection with the Substation.

 G. In accordance with the I&S Agreement, the City and PSE are entering into this Substation Easement.

 H. The Property is within the area protected for purposes of supplying drinking water to much of the City and surrounding communities. Consequently, any easement with respect to the Substation must delineate and control permissible activities within the Property.

 EASEMENT

 For and in consideration of ten and 00/100ths dollars ($10.00), the mutual promises contained herein and in the I&S Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the City as Grantor hereby conveys and quitclaims to PSE as Grantee, for the purposes hereinafter set forth, an exclusive perpetual easement over, under, along, across and through the real property in King County, Washington described in Attachment 2 hereto (the "Substation Area"), together with a non- exclusive, perpetual easement for ingress and egress over the real property in King County, Washington described in Attachment 3 hereto (the "Access Area").

 The Substation Area and the Access Area are described pictorially in Attachment 1 and are referred to collectively as the "Easement Areas." In the event of any conflict between the legal descriptions and the pictorial representation of the Easement Areas, the legal descriptions shall control.

 Purposes of Easement. Grantee shall have the right (i) within the Substation Area, to use, operate, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, improve and remove an electrical substation containing one 25 MVA transformer and related electrical equipment and, at any future time, one additional 25 MVA transformer and related electrical equipment (the "Addition") (as existing on the date hereof and with the Addition, the "Substation"), (ii) to construct the Addition and (iii) to use the Access Area for ingress to and egress from the Substation Area (collectively, the "Purposes"), ALL SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

 1. Use of Easement Areas

 A. Except for the Purposes set forth immediately above, Grantee shall not enter upon the Easement Areas or make any use thereof. Grantee shall at all times exercise its rights hereunder (i) in a manner designed to prevent bodily harm to persons (whomsoever) and damage to property (whatsoever), (ii) in accordance with the terms of this Substation Easement and with the terms of the letter to Grantee dated July 7, 2003 and the therein enclosed Cedar River and Lake Youngs Watershed Access & Quality Control Regulations ("Lake Youngs Regulations) and Additional Regulations - Part 2, Operations Phase ("Additional Regulations") and (iii) except to the extent in conflict with the other provisions of this Substation Easement, in accordance with the terms of any successor document of general application (as may be modified from time to time) to the Lake Youngs Regulations or the Additional Regulations. Precautionary measures to be taken by Grantee pursuant to the Lake Youngs Regulations and Additional Regulations shall include, without limitation, security measures necessary to prevent unauthorized access to the Easement Areas.

 B. At no time shall Grantee bring into or use in the Easement Areas fuel or explosive or flammable materials, other than those inherently or reasonably necessary in connection with the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement or improvement of the Substation or construction of the Addition. At no time shall Grantee store or keep any fuel or explosive or flammable materials whatsoever in the Easement Areas, other than (i) fuel or explosive or flammable materials contained in installed Substation equipment components and (ii) fuel or explosive or flammable materials contained in equipment or a tank firmly attached thereto), if such equipment is being used in connection with Substation work. If permitted under the previous sentence, fuel or explosive or flammable materials may be kept or stored for the shorter of the period specified in section 1.D or the duration of Substation work, No other storage of fuel or explosive or flammable materials is allowed. Grantor shall be notified at least two (2) full working days in advance of any use or storage (in which case notice shall include the proposed duration of storage) of fuel or explosive or flammable materials in the Easement Areas.

 C. Grantee shall promptly pay (and secure the discharge of any liens against the Easement Areas asserted by) all persons and entities furnishing any labor, equipment, services, supplies, materials or other items in connection with the exercise of Grantee's rights hereunder.

 D. Except for less than forty-eight (48) hours(or any longer period with the prior written consent of Grantor) and in connection with the exercise of its rights hereunder, Grantee shall not cause or permit any equipment, supplies or other items to be kept or stored upon the Easement Areas. Except while performing work on the Substation, Grantee shall not park vehicles in the Easement Areas.

 E. Grantee shall not construct or install any structure whatsoever, other than the Substation, in the Easement Areas. By way of example only, Grantee shall not construct or install a maintenance structure, storage structure, vault or garage in the Substation Area.

 F. Prior to the date hereof, Grantee has submitted to Grantor, and Grantor has approved, Grantee's Spill Clean-up Policy, Document No. 0150.3100, dated November, 2002, and the letter dated June 23, 2003 from Grantee to Grantor, together fulfilling Grantor's requirements for a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan ("SPCCP-O"), in connection with the operation, maintenance, modification, repair, replacement and removal of the Substation. Grantee shall use, operate, maintain, modify, repair and remove the Substation in accordance with the SPCCP-O, with modifications thereto, if any, that are either reasonably required or approved by Grantor to reflect changed physical or regulatory conditions that may arise over time. Five (5) years after the date on which electric power is provided to the Property through the Substation on a commercial basis (the "Commercial Operation Date"), and every five (5) years thereafter, Grantee shall deliver to Grantor a proposed revision to the SPCCP-O, and Grantee shall make such changes to said proposed revision as Grantor reasonably may request. Prior to the energization of any of the 12.5 kV feeder circuits extending from the Substation to Grantee's electrical facilities on Petrovitsky Road (the "Petrovitsky Feeders"), Grantor shall reimburse Grantee within thirty (30) days of receipt of Grantee's invoices (from time to time) for all increased costs and expenses incurred by Grantee to the extent that they are attributable to Grantee's compliance with any Grantor-required changes to the SPCCP-O, provided that such invoices are documented to the reasonable satisfaction of Grantor.

 G. At least forty (40) days prior to commencing work in the Substation Area on the Addition or any other work in the Substation Area that would result in a change in the one-line electrical drawings or civil drawings for the Substation last submitted to Grantor, Grantee shall submit to Grantor (i) a Temporary Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan ("TESCP"), (ii) a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan ("SPCCP") addressing the items outlined in the "Common Elements of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan" enclosed with the letter from Grantor to Grantee dated July 7, 2003 (as used in said enclosure, the term "hazardous materials," shall have the same meaning as the term "Hazardous Substances," defined in section 5.F hereof) and (iii) one-line electrical drawings and civil drawings in sufficient detail to provide Grantor with a clear understanding of the proposed modifications to the Substation Area.

 Grantee shall make such changes to the proposed TESCP, SPCCP, and one-line electrical drawings and civil drawings as Grantor reasonably may request to reflect then current best management practices or otherwise. Grantee shall not commence any work to which this section 1.G applies without obtaining the prior written consent of Grantor, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or denied; provided, that failure by Grantor to respond to the aforesaid submittals within thirty (30) days after receipt shall be deemed to constitute Grantor's consent; provided, further, that under emergency conditions Grantee shall provide the required submittals in such time and manner as is reasonable under the circumstances and may commence (and complete) work to which this section 1.G applies prior to obtaining the prior written consent of Grantor to do so. All work to which this section 1.G applies, except for work in response to emergency conditions, shall be done in accordance with the one-line electrical drawings, civil drawings, TESCP and SPCCP approved by Grantor. Promptly after completion of work to which this section 1.G applies, Grantee shall provide Grantor with as-built one-line electrical drawings and civil drawings in sufficient detail to provide Grantor with a clear understanding of the improvements located within the

 Substation Area.

 H. At least ten (10) working days prior to the commencement of any work to which section 1.G applies (except when emergency conditions make such prior notice impracticable), Grantee shall provide Grantor with a work schedule detailing the time of performance and completion of such activities. For projects of a duration longer than one (1) month, Grantee shall provide Grantor with an updated work schedule on a monthly basis.

 I. Grantee shall notify Grantor of any tests, surveys, drawings or other documents prepared with respect to the Easement Areas and, if requested by Grantor, Grantee promptly shall provide such documents to Grantor in hard format and, if feasible, electronic format.

 J. The information required under section 1.F through 1.I is for informational purposes only. Grantor's receipt of such information, and any review analysis or consideration thereof by Grantor, or Grantor's failure to review, analyze or consider such information (including without limitation failure to discover any error, defect or inadequacy of such information) shall not relieve Grantee of any of its obligations hereunder.

 K. Grantee shall comply with all requirements of Chapter 19.122 Revised Code of Washington, as it may be amended from time to time, with respect to the location of underground utilities.

 L. Grantee shall have the exclusive right of occupation of the Substation Area; provided, that Grantor (i) may enter and occupy (for such period as is reasonably necessary to accomplish Grantor's rights under section 2) the unfenced Substation Area at any time and (ii) upon three (3) working days' prior notice to Grantee, Grantor may enter and occupy (for such period as is reasonably necessary to accomplish Grantor's rights under section 2) the fenced portion of the Substation Area at any reasonable time, except that if Grantor desires to enter and occupy the fenced portion of the Substation Area in response to emergency conditions, Grantor shall provide only such notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. Grantor shall not enter or occupy the fenced portion of the Substation Area unaccompanied by an employee of Grantee. If Grantee fails to provide an accompanying employee, Grantee shall be in breach of this Substation Easement, but such breach shall not entitle Grantor to enter or occupy the fenced Substation Area. In the event of a breach by Grantee of its obligations under this section 1.L, the provisions of section 10 shall apply.

 M. In its use of the Easement Areas, Grantee shall comply with all security requirements generally imposed by Grantor (including without limitation the locking of gates) and provided by Grantor in writing to Grantee, as such requirements may be modified from time to time, provided such requirements are not in direct conflict with this Substation Easement. Grantee shall use the Access Area in a manner that does not interfere with ingress or egress by other persons and their equipment and vehicles; provided, that Grantee may request, ten (10) working days in advance, a temporary blockage of roads in the Access Area so that Grantee may perform scheduled maintenance or construction. Grantee's request shall include detailed information regarding the activity to be performed, equipment to be utilized and duration of blockage. Grantee's request shall not unreasonably be delayed or denied. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Substation Easement, Grantee shall not use any portion of the Access Area to keep, park or store any vehicles, equipment, supplies, or other items. Grantee shall not bring into the Easement Areas any vehicle with a live load that exceeds the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials HS20-44 Standard Truck Loading, without the prior written consent of Grantor.

 N. As used in this section 1, the terms Grantor and Grantee shall include the employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors (of any tier), licensees or invitees of each.

 2. Reservation

 A. Grantor reserves to itself the right to use the Easement Areas for its own purposes in any way that does not conflict with the rights herein granted; provided that, subject to section 1.L, Grantee's rights hereunder shall not preclude Grantor from taking any measures with respect to the Easement Areas that Grantor deems necessary to protect public health or safety. In addition, Grantor reserves to itself the right (i) to require Grantee to relocate the Substation within or outside the Substation Area, but in any event within the Lake Youngs Reservation (as depicted in Attachment 1) or on other property owned by Grantor and, if outside the Substation Area, to require the amendment of the Substation Area under this Substation Easement to reflect such relocation, and (ii) subject to section 1.L, to enter upon and occupy the Easement Areas from time to time to take such actions as Grantor deems necessary to remediate Hazardous Substances (as defined in section 5.F) or to assure compliance with Environmental Laws (as defined in section 5.E), other than those of The City of Seattle, or the provisions of this Substation Easement regarding Hazardous Substances (each, an "Environmental Action"), whether or not the Environmental Action is required (directly or indirectly) for compliance with any law or regulation (other than a law or regulation of The City of Seattle) or is necessitated by an agreement between Grantor and another governmental or regulatory agency with respect to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances. With respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of the previous sentence, (x) Grantor shall provide reasonable notice to Grantee of the schedule and nature of any required Substation relocation or Environmental Action, and Grantor shall provide a reasonable opportunity for Grantee to review and comment thereon, (y)to the extent reasonably feasible, Grantor shall plan any required Substation relocation and shall plan and execute any Environmental Action so as to minimize adverse effects on Grantee's service to its customer load, and (z) Grantor shall reimburse Grantee for costs and expenses incurred by Grantee only to the extent that Grantee's costs and expenses are documented to Grantor's reasonable satisfaction and are attributable to (a) a required Substation relocation or (b) an Environmental Action that is not an action taken by Grantor in accordance with section 5.C or 5.D. Any use of the Substation Area by Grantor not specifically addressed in this Substation Easement shall be subject to Grantee's prior written consent.

 B. Grantee accepts the reservations contained in section 2.A, acknowledges that its rights with respect to the Access Area are non- exclusive, and agrees that Grantor itself may use the Access Area and may grant other easements, property interests or use rights with respect thereto, so long as such grants (or any use pursuant to such grants) do not conflict or interfere with Grantee's exercise of its rights hereunder.

 3. Condition of Easement Areas. Without limiting any of the provisions of sections 5.G and 7.B, Grantee represents that it has inspected the Easement Areas and conducted such assessments as it deems appropriate, and Grantee accepts the Easement Areas, solely for the Purposes, in their present condition, "As Is," with all faults known and unknown; provided, that Grantor agrees, at Grantor's sole expense, to perform wetland buffer mitigation on the Property, and related monitoring, reporting and maintenance as required by any governmental authority with jurisdiction. Grantee's acceptance and use of the Easement Areas is not, and shall not be deemed, acceptance of Hazardous Substances that previously have been released in the Easement Areas, nor is Grantee responsible to remediate such prior conditions to bring the Easement Areas into compliance with Environmental Laws. Grantor retains, and as between Grantor and Grantee, shall remain liable for, such obligations, if any.

 Grantee represents that it is not relying on any statements, written or oral, made by or on behalf of Grantor with respect to the condition of the Easement Areas, although Grantee acknowledges receipt of the report entitled Environmental Site Assessment and Soil Removal Oversight, prepared by Herrera Environmental Consultants and dated July 3, 2003. Grantee acknowledges that no representations or warranties, express or implied, have been made by or on behalf of Grantor with respect to the condition of the Easement Areas or the use or occupancy of that may be made of them by Grantee, including without limitation their suitability or sufficiency for Grantee's intended use or purposes.

 4. Vegetation and Pest Control

 A. Grantor hereby approves Grantee's Vegetation Management Plan ("VMP") with respect to the Substation Area dated March 21, 2003. At Grantor's request, Grantee and Grantor shall meet to discuss and review Grantee's implementation of its VMP. Five (5) years after the Commercial Operation, and every five (5) years thereafter, Grantee shall deliver to Grantor a proposed revision to Grantee's VMP identifying the trees outside the Substation Area but on the Property that Grantee has determined met the criteria of "non-imminent danger trees" set forth in the then-current, approved VMP and that Grantee desires to remove in the next five (5) years, as well as other possible changes to the VMP reflecting then-current best management practices and/or changed conditions. In addition, prior to taking any action that does not conform to the then-current, approved VMP, Grantee shall submit to Grantor a proposed revision. Grantee shall make such changes to its proposed revision as Grantor may reasonably require. Grantor shall promptly reimburse Grantee upon receipt of Grantee's invoices (from time to time) for all direct increased costs incurred by Grantee that are attributable to such changes to the proposed VMP that Grantor has reasonably required.

 B. Grantee shall use no chemical pesticides, including without limitation herbicides, rodenticides and insecticides (collectively, "Biocides") in the initial removal or subsequent management of vegetation within the Property. As used in this Substation Easement, "vegetation" means all forms of plant life, including, without limitation, trees. In addition, Grantee shall not apply plant nutrients in the Easement Areas without the prior written approval of Grantor.

 C. Grantee shall have the right to cut, trim, remove and dispose of any tree on the Property that falls within the criteria for a "non-imminent danger tree" or an "imminent danger tree" set forth in the then-current, approved VMP; provided, that such right shall be exercised strictly in accordance with the terms of this Substation Easement, Grantee's approved VMP, and all applicable laws or regulations. Grantee shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary governmental permits for trimming, cutting or removal of trees and other vegetation. Grantee shall pay Grantor the actual amount received by Grantee (if any) from the sale of any merchantable timber that Grantee cuts. Grantee also shall have the right, in conformity with the terms of this Substation Easement and Grantee's approved VMP, to manage and control the establishment and growth of all vegetation in the Substation Area.

 D. In the Substation Area, Grantee shall control noxious weeds (as such term is defined in RCW 17.10.010 as amended from time to time) in a manner conforming to the terms of this Substation Easement, the requirements of the King County Noxious Weed Control Program (or successor programs), and Grantee's VMP shall describe such activities.

 E. In the Access Area, Grantee shall have no obligation to control noxious weeds, nor shall Grantee have any right to control vegetation in any manner.

 5. Hazardous Materials; Waste

 A. All Grantee's operations or activities on or about the Property, and any use or occupancy of the Easement Areas, including without limitation any use or occupancy of the Easement Areas by any employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor (of any tier), licensee or invitee of Grantee, shall be in all material respects in compliance with all Environmental Laws (as defined in section 5.E), including those governing, or in any way relating to, the generation, handling, storage, use transportation, discharge or disposal (whether legal or illegal, accidental or intentional) of any Hazardous Substance (as defined in section 5.F). More specifically, Grantee shall not cause to occur upon the Easement Areas, or permit the Easement Areas to be used to, generate, manufacture, refine, transport, treat, store, handle, dispose discharge, transfer, or process any Hazardous Substance, except in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and with Grantor's prior written consent. Grantee shall not allow the release, storage, use or disposal of any Hazardous Substance on or about the Property except for their intended purposes as reasonably necessary for activities of Grantee permitted hereunder, and only upon the prior written consent of Grantor and in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. Grantee shall dispose offsite of all spent materials (waste), whether they are Hazardous Substances or not, in accordance with all applicable laws.

 B. Prior to bringing into, using in (including without limitation treating or taking any other action with respect to any Hazardous Substance then being used in the Easement Areas), or removing from the Easement Areas any Hazardous Substance except for vehicle fuel and vehicle operating fluid (each, a "Use"), Grantee shall provide written notice to Grantor (which notice shall be received at least five (5) days prior to the Use) of the type and quantity of Hazardous Substance involved in the Use, together with a statement on which Grantor may rely that the then-current SPCCP-O or SPCCP, as applicable, adequately addresses Grantee's intended Use, or Grantee shall deliver a proposed revision to that SPCCP-O or SPCCP, as applicable; provided, that the requirements of this section 5.B shall not apply to any Use of Hazardous Substances addressed in the approved SPCCP-O or SPCCP. Grantor's notice shall include the schedule and purpose of the Use. Grantee shall engage in no Use without Grantor's written approval, which shall not unreasonably be withheld or denied. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 5.B, in response to emergency conditions, Grantee shall provide the aforesaid notice at such time as is reasonable under the circumstances, and Grantee may engage in such Use prior to obtaining Grantor's written approval. Promptly after completing the activities described in the approved notice, Grantee shall report to Grantor in writing on the Use that actually occurred, including without limitation type and amount of Hazardous Substances involved and incidents of spills or dangerous waste disposal.

 C. With respect to the Substation Area, if Grantee, any employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor (of any tier), licensee or invitee of Grantee, or any other person (other than Grantor, its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors of any tier, licensees or invitees) violates any of the terms of this Substation Easement concerning compliance with Environmental Laws or the presence, Use, handling or storage of Hazardous Substances, Grantee shall promptly take such action as is necessary to mitigate and correct the violation. Grantor shall have no liability or responsibility for any costs that may be incurred by Grantee in connection with or as a result of actions taken by Grantor in accordance with this section 5.C. If Grantee does not so act in a prudent and prompt manner, Grantor reserves the right, but not the obligation, subject to all other provisions of this Substation Easement, to act in place of Grantee (for which purpose Grantee hereby appoints Grantor as its agent), to enter onto the Substation Area and to take such actions as Grantor deems necessary to ensure compliance or to mitigate the violation, provided Grantor has provided reasonable notice to Grantee of its intentions. All costs and expenses incurred by Grantor in connection with any such actions performed by Grantor shall become immediately due and payable by Grantee upon Grantor's presentation of an invoice therefor.

 D. With respect to the Access Area, if Grantee, any employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor (of any tier), licensee or invitee of Grantee violates any of the terms of this Substation Easement concerning compliance with Environmental Laws or the presence, Use, handling or storage of Hazardous Substances, Grantee shall promptly take such action as is necessary to mitigate and correct the violation. Grantor shall have no liability or responsibility for any costs that may be incurred by Grantee in connection with or as a result of actions taken by Grantor in accordance with this section 5.C. If Grantee does not so act in a prudent and prompt manner, Grantor reserves the right, but not the obligation, subject to all other provisions of this Substation Easement, to act in place of Grantee (for which purpose Grantee hereby appoints Grantor as its agent), to enter onto the Access Area and to take such actions as Grantor deems necessary to ensure compliance or to mitigate the violation, provided Grantor has provided reasonable notice to Grantee of its intentions. All costs and expenses incurred by Grantor in connection with any such actions performed by Grantor shall become immediately due and payable by Grantee upon Grantor's presentation of an invoice therefor.

This section 7.C has been mutually negotiated by the parties.

Grantee shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the specified breach or default, or such longer period as is reasonably necessary to effect such cure if cure cannot be accomplished within such 30-day period, so long as such cure has been commenced within such 30-day period and is being diligently pursued; provided, that in the event of a breach or default that may affect public health or safety (including without limitation Grantee's failure to meet its obligations under section 5) or in an emergency situation, Grantee shall have one (1) working day after receipt of notice to commence curing the breach or default and shall proceed diligently to effect such cure.

 11. Termination

 A. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, all of Grantee's rights under this Substation Easement shall terminate automatically in the event that Grantee ceases to use the Substation Area for a period of three (3) years or other mutually agreed upon time.

Such removal and restoration shall be done at Grantee's sole expense and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Grantor. If Grantee fails, within a reasonable time, to remove the Substation or take such other measures as are mutually agreed upon, Grantor may, after reasonable notice to Grantee, remove the Substation and restore the Substation Area at the expense of Grantee. In lieu of removal of the Substation and site restoration as provided above, Grantor may, at its option, direct Grantee to transfer the Substation to Grantor, whereupon this Substation Easement shall be deemed terminated and Grantee shall have no further responsibility or liability hereunder arising after the date of transfer, except with respect to provisions hereof that survive termination.

 14. Survival. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions hereof, sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 and all other provisions hereof that reasonably may be interpreted or construed as surviving termination of this Substation Easement shall survive such termination.

 Grantee hereby assumes all risk of damage to the Substation Area and Grantee's property therein, or injury to its officers, directors, agents, contractors, or invitees, in or about the Property from any cause, and hereby waives all claims against the City other than claims for negligence or willful misconduct. The Grantee further waives, with respect to the City only, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance, of the Revised Code of Washington. In addition, Grantee shall secure its liability for any Federal Workers' Compensation Act exposure, such as the United States Longshoreman's & Harbor Workers Act (USL&H Act) and Maritime Employers Liability (Jones Act), by purchasing insurance coverage as appropriate.

 G. INSURANCE TO PROTECT GRANTEE'S EQUIPMENT

 Grantee shall purchase and maintain property insurance upon the Grantee's equipment for the Actual Cash Value of such equipment as of the time of any loss. This insurance shall insure for "All Risk" perils.

 Grantee shall be responsible for any deductibles or coinsurance penalties. Grantee waives its right of action against Grantor for loss or damage to any equipment used in connection with this Substation Easement and covered by property insurance, other than any right of action for negligence or willful misconduct.

 H. ADJUSTMENTS

 Grantor reserves the right to review annually the appropriateness of the coverage and limits set forth herein in view of inflation and/or changing industry conditions. Grantor may require an increase in such coverage or limits upon ninety (90) days prior written notice.

 ELECTRICAL AND COMMUNICATION FACILITY EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 This Electrical and Communication Facility Easement Agreement ("ECF Easement") is made this ___ day of _________, 200____ ("Effective Date"), by and between The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through Seattle Public Utilities (the "City" or "Grantor") and Puget Sound Energy, Inc., a corporation of the State of Washington ("PSE" or "Grantee").

 RECITALS

 A. The City owns certain real property in unincorporated King County, Washington, commonly referred to as the Lake Youngs Reservation (described pictorially on Attachment 1, (the "Property").

 B. The City is constructing a water treatment facility on the Property, which facility requires primary voltage electric service.

 C. In the Installation and Service Agreement dated as of August 1, 2003 (the "I&S Agreement") between the City and PSE, the parties agreed that it would be most efficient and effective for both parties if PSE were to provide the required electric service through a substation located on the Property (the "Substation") and through related electrical equipment and fiber optic communication facilities, some of which will be installed in conduit and some of which will continue to be directly buried, also located on the Property as described in Attachment 2 (the "ECF," and collectively with the Substation, the "PSE Facilities").

 D. In the I&S Agreement, the parties also agreed that it would be most efficient and effective for both parties if certain communications facilities required by the City on the Property, listed on Attachment 2 (the "City Facilities"), were co-located in a common trench with the ECF, as described in Attachment 2.

 E. Pursuant to a Temporary Construction Permit Agreement dated August 1, 2003 between the City and PSE, PSE has constructed and installed the PSE Facilities and the City Facilities.

 F. Prior to the date hereof, each of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Seattle City Council has authorized, approved or otherwise accepted, without change or condition unacceptable to PSE or City, all documents required to be submitted (including this ECF Easement) to the applicable entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by the I&S Agreement.

 G. In accordance with the I&S Agreement, the City and PSE, on even date herewith, have entered into a Substation Easement Agreement with respect to operation of the Substation.

 H. In accordance with the I&S Agreement, the City and PSE are entering into this ECF Easement.

 I. The Property is within the area protected for purposes of supplying drinking water to much of the City and surrounding communities. Consequently, any easement with respect to the ECF, and access thereto, must delineate and control permissible activities within the Property.

 EASEMENT

 For and in consideration of ten and 00/100ths dollars ($10.00), the mutual promises contained herein and in the I&S Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the City as Grantor hereby conveys and quitclaims to PSE as Grantee, for the purposes hereinafter set forth, a nonexclusive perpetual easement over, under, along, across and through the real property in King County, Washington described in Attachment 3 hereto (the "ECF Area" ), together with a nonexclusive, perpetual easement for ingress and egress over the real property in King County, Washington described in Attachment 4 hereto (the "Access Area").

 The ECF Area and the Access Area are described pictorially in Attachment 1 and are referred to collectively as the "Easement Areas." In the event of any conflict between the legal descriptions and the pictorial representation of the Easement Areas, the legal descriptions shall control.

 Purposes of ECF Easement. Grantee shall have the right (i) within the ECF Area, to use, operate, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, improve and remove the ECF, as described in Attachment 2, and to add electrical equipment or fiber optic communication facilities (collectively, "Additions") to the ECF as may be necessary to support the Substation, as it now is configured or as may be configured in the future pursuant to the Substation Easement Agreement and (ii) to use the Access Area for ingress to and egress from the ECF Area (collectively, the "Purposes"), ALL SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

 1. Use of Easement Areas

 A. Except for the Purposes set forth immediately above, Grantee shall not enter upon the Easement Areas or make any use thereof. Grantee shall at all times exercise its rights hereunder (i) in a manner designed to prevent bodily harm to persons ( whomsoever) and damage to property (whatsoever), (ii) in accordance with the terms of this ECF Easement and the letter to Grantee dated July 7, 2003, including the therein enclosed Cedar River and Lake Youngs Watershed Access & Quality Control (the "Lake Youngs Regulations") and Additional Regulations - Part 2, Operations Phase ("Additional Regulations") and (iii) except to the extent in conflict with the other provisions of this ECF Easement, in accordance with the terms of any successor document of general application (as may be modified from time to time) to the Lake Youngs Regulations or the Additional Regulations. Precautionary measures to be taken by Grantee pursuant to the Lake Youngs Regulations and Additional Regulations shall include, without limitation, security measures necessary to prevent unauthorized access to the Easement Areas.

 B. At no time shall Grantee bring into or use in the Easement Areas fuel or explosive or flammable materials, other than those inherently or reasonably necessary in connection with the operation, maintenance, repair or replacement of the ECF or construction of Additions. At no time shall Grantee keep or store any fuel or explosive or flammable materials whatsoever in the Easement Areas, except that with respect to equipment being used in connection with ECF work and for the shorter of the period specified in section 1.D or the duration of such work, Grantee may keep or store fuel that is contained in such equipment or in a tank that is firmly attached to such equipment. No other storage of fuel or explosive or flammable materials is allowed. Grantor shall be notified at least two (2) full working days in advance of any use or storage (in which case notice shall include the proposed duration of storage) of fuel or explosive or flammable materials in the Easement Areas.

 C. Grantee shall promptly pay (and secure the discharge of any liens against the Easement Areas asserted by) all persons and entities furnishing any labor, equipment, services, supplies, materials or other items in connection with the exercise of Grantee's rights hereunder.

 D. Except in connection with the exercise of its rights hereunder and for less than forty-eight hours (or any longer period with the prior written consent of Grantor), Grantee shall not cause or permit any equipment, supplies or other items to be kept or stored upon the Easement Areas. Except while performing work on the PSE Equipment and Facilities, Grantee shall not park vehicles in the Easement Areas.

 E. Grantee shall not construct or install any above-surface structure whatsoever in the Easement Areas. By way of example only, Grantee shall not construct or install a maintenance structure, storage structure, vault or garage in the ECF Area.

 F. Prior to the date hereof, Grantee has submitted to Grantor, and Grantor has approved, Grantee's Spill Clean-up Policy, dated November, 2002, Document No. 0150.3100, fulfilling Grantor's requirements for a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan - Operations Phase, November, 2002 ( "SPCCP-O"), all in connection with the operation, maintenance, modification, repair, replacement and removal of the PSE Facilities. Grantee shall use, operate, maintain, modify, repair and remove the ECF in accordance with the SPCCP-O, with modifications thereto, if any, that are approved by Grantor to reflect changed physical or regulatory conditions that may arise over time. Five (5) years after the date on which electric power is provided to the Property through the Substation on a commercial basis (the "Commercial Operation Date"), and every five (5) years thereafter, Grantee shall deliver to Grantor a proposed revision to the SPCCP-O, and Grantee shall make such changes to said proposed revision as Grantor reasonably may request. Prior to the energization of any of Grantee's 12.5 kV distribution equipment extending from the Substation to Grantee's electrical facilities on Petrovitsky Road (the "Petrovitsky Feeders"), City shall reimburse Grantee within thirty (30) days of receipt of Grantee's invoices (from to time to time) for all increased costs and expenses incurred by Grantee to the extent that they are attributable to Grantee's compliance with any such Grantor-required changes to the SPCCP-O, provided that such invoices are documented to the reasonable satisfaction of Grantor. Grantee shall give Grantor written notice at least ten (10) working days prior to pulling electrical lines or fiber optic cable through conduit in the ECF Area or otherwise maintaining, repairing or replacing ECF, except that in an emergency such notice shall be given as soon as practicable.

 G. Any Additions permitted under this ECF Easement shall be no less than one (1) foot vertically from the City Facilities or any other facilities of Grantor, as they may exist at the time Grantee commences construction of such Additions.

 At least forty (40) days prior to commencing work on an Addition or any other work in the ECF Area that would result in a change in the one-line electrical drawings or civil drawings for the ECF last submitted to Grantor, Grantee shall submit to Grantor (i) a Temporary Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan ("TESCP"), (ii) a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan ("SPCCP") addressing the items outlined in the "Common Elements of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan" enclosed with the letter from Grantor to Grantee dated July 7, 2003 (as used in said enclosure, the term "hazardous materials" shall have the same meaning as the term "Hazardous Substances," defined in section 5.F hereof) and (iii) one- line electrical drawings and civil drawings in sufficient detail to provide Grantor with a clear understanding of the proposed modifications to the ECF Area.

 Grantee shall make such changes to the proposed TESCP, SPCCP, and one-line electrical drawings and civil drawings as Grantor reasonably may request to reflect then current best management practices or otherwise. Grantee shall not commence any work to which this section 1.G applies without obtaining the prior written consent of Grantor, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or denied; provided, that failure by Grantor to respond to the aforesaid submittals within thirty (30) days after receipt shall be deemed to constitute Grantor's consent; provided, further, that under emergency conditions Grantee shall provide the required submittals in such time and manner as is reasonable under the circumstances and may commence (and complete) work to which this section 1.G applies prior to obtaining the prior written consent of Grantor to do so. All work to which this section 1.G applies, except for work in response to emergency conditions, shall be in accordance with the one-line electrical drawings and civil drawings, TESCP and SPCCP approved by Grantor. Promptly after completion of work to which this section 1.G applies, Grantee shall provide Grantor with as-built one-line electrical drawings and civil drawings, both in sufficient detail to provide Grantor with a clear understanding of the improvements located within the ECF Area.

 H. At least ten (10) working days prior to the commencement of any work to which section 1.G applies (except when emergency conditions make such prior notice impracticable), Grantee shall provide Grantor with a work schedule detailing the time of performance and completion of such activities. For projects of a duration longer than one (1) month, Grantee shall provide Grantor with an updated work schedule on a monthly basis.

 I. Grantee shall notify Grantor of any tests, surveys, drawings or other documents prepared with respect to the Easement Areas and, if requested by Grantor, Grantee promptly shall provide such documents to Grantor in hard format and, if feasible, electronic format.

 J. The information required under section 1.F through 1.I is for informational purposes only. Grantor's receipt of such information, and any review analysis or consideration thereof by Grantor, or Grantor's failure to review, analyze or consider such information (including without limitation failure to discover any error, defect or inadequacy of such information) shall not relieve Grantee of any of its obligations hereunder.

 K. Grantee shall comply with all requirements of Chapter 19.122 Revised Code of Washington, as it may be amended from time to time, with respect to locating underground utilities.

 L. Grantee recognizes that the ECF is located close to the City Facilities in the ECF Area. Grantor recognizes that the City Facilities are located close to the PSE Equipment and Facilities in the ECF Area. Neither Grantee nor Grantor shall have any rights with respect to the other party's equipment or facilities in the ECF Area, except as may be set forth herein. Neither Grantee nor Grantor shall have any obligations with respect to the other party's equipment or facilities in the ECF Area, except (i) that neither party shall engage in or permit any activity that interferes with, disturbs or damages the other party's equipment or facilities in the ECF Area and (ii) as may be set forth herein.

 M. In its use of the Easement Areas, Grantee shall comply with all security requirements generally imposed by Grantor (including without limitation the locking of gates) and provided by Grantor in writing to Grantee, as such requirements may be modified from time to time, provided such requirements are not in direct conflict with this ECF Easement. Grantee shall use the Easement Areas in a manner that does not interfere with ingress or egress by other persons and their equipment and vehicles; provided, that Grantee may request, ten (10) working days in advance, a temporary blockage of roads in the Easement Areas so that Grantee may perform scheduled maintenance or construction. Grantee's request shall include detailed information regarding the activity to be performed, equipment to be utilized and duration of blockage. Grantee's request shall not unreasonably be delayed or denied. Grantee shall not use any portion of the Easement Areas to keep or store any vehicles, equipment, supplies, or other items. Grantee shall not bring into the Easement Areas any vehicle with a live load that exceeds the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials HS20-44 Standard Truck Loading, without the prior written consent of Grantor.

 N. As used in this section 1, the terms Grantor and Grantee shall include the employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors (of any tier), licensees or invitees of each.

 2. Reservation

With respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of the previous sentence, (x) Grantor shall provide reasonable notice to Grantee of the schedule and nature of any required ECF relocation or Environmental Action, and Grantor shall provide a reasonable opportunity for Grantee to review and comment on the Environmental Action, (y) to the extent reasonably feasible, Grantor shall plan any required ECF relocation and shall plan and execute any Environmental Action so as to minimize adverse effects on Grantee's service to its customer load, and (z) Grantor shall reimburse Grantee for costs and expenses incurred by Grantee to the extent that Grantee's costs and expenses are documented to Grantor's reasonable satisfaction and are attributable to (a) a required ECF relocation or (b) an Environmental Action that is not an action taken by Grantor in accordance with section 5.C.

 B. Grantee accepts the reservations contained in section 2.A, acknowledges that its rights with respect to the Easement Areas are non-exclusive, and agrees that Grantor itself may use the Easement Areas and may grant other easements, property interests or use rights to third parties with respect to the Easement Areas, so long as such grants (or any use pursuant to such grants) do not conflict or interfere with Grantee's exercise of its rights hereunder.

 3. Condition of Easement Areas. Without limiting any of the provisions of sections 5.D and 7.B, Grantee represents that it has inspected the Easement Areas and conducted such assessments as it deems appropriate, and Grantee accepts the Easement Areas, solely for the Purposes, in their present condition, "As Is," with all faults known and unknown.

All Grantee's operations or activities on or about the Property, and any use or occupancy of the Easement Areas, including without limitation any use or occupancy of the Easement Areas by any employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor (of any tier), licensee or invitee of Grantee, shall be in all material respects in compliance with all Environmental Laws (as defined in section 5.E), including those governing, or in any way relating to, the generation, handling, storage, use transportation, discharge or disposal (whether legal or illegal, accidental or intentional) of any Hazardous Substance (as defined in section 5.F). More specifically, Grantee shall not cause to occur upon the Easement Areas, or permit the Easement Areas to be used to, generate, manufacture, refine, transport, treat, store, handle, dispose, discharge, transfer, or process any Hazardous Substance, except in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and with Grantor's prior written consent.

 B. Prior to bringing into, using in (including without limitation treating or taking any other action with respect to any Hazardous Substance then being used in the Easement Areas), or removing from the Easement Areas any Hazardous Substance except for vehicle fuel and vehicle operating fluid (each, a "Use"), Grantee shall provide written notice to Grantor (which notice shall be received at least five (5) days prior to the Use) of the type and quantity of Hazardous Substance involved in the Use, together with a statement on which Grantor may rely that the then-current SPCCP or SPCCP-O, as applicable, adequately addresses Grantee's intended Use, or Grantee shall deliver a proposed revision to that SPCCP or SPCCP-O, as applicable; provided, that the requirements of this section 5.B shall not apply to any Use of Hazardous Substances addressed in the approved SPCCP or SPCCP-O. Grantee's notice shall include the schedule and purpose of the Use. Grantee shall engage in no Use without Grantor's written approval, which shall not unreasonably be withheld or denied. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 5.B, in response to emergency conditions, Grantee shall provide the aforesaid notice at such time as is reasonable under the circumstances and Grantee may engage in such Use prior to obtaining Grantor's written approval. Promptly after completing the activities described in the approved notice, Grantee shall report to Grantor in writing on the Use that actually occurred, including without limitation type and amount of Hazardous Substances involved and incidents of spills or dangerous waste disposal.

Grantor shall have no liability or responsibility for any costs that may be incurred by Grantee in connection with or as a result of actions taken by Grantor in accordance with this section 5.C.

 If Grantee does not so act in a prudent and prompt manner, Grantor reserves the right, but not the obligation, subject to all other provisions of this ECF Easement, to act in place of Grantee (for which purpose Grantee hereby appoints Grantor as its agent), to enter onto the Easement Areas and to take such actions as Grantor deems necessary to ensure compliance or to mitigate the violation, provided Grantor has provided reasonable notice to Grantee of its intentions. All costs and expenses incurred by Grantor in connection with any such actions performed by Grantor shall become immediately due and payable by Grantee upon Grantor's presentation of an invoice therefor.

 D. With respect to any Hazardous Substances that are on the Easement Areas as of the Effective Date or are released on the Easement Areas thereafter by Grantor or any employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor (of any tier), licensee or invitee of Grantor, a disturbance or movement (without more) of such Hazardous Substances within the ECF Area or between the Access Area and the ECF Area by Grantee or any employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor (of any tier), licensee or invitee of Grantee during activities of Grantee permitted hereunder shall not be a violation of the terms of this ECF Easement concerning compliance with Environmental Laws, the presence or Use of Hazardous Substances in the Easement Areas, or the handling or storing of Hazardous Substances.

 E. For the purposes of this ECF Easement, the term "Environmental Law(s)" means any local, state or federal law, regulation, ordinance, order or other source of law, now or hereafter in effect relating to the protection of human health or the environment including, but not limited to: the Federal Clean Air Act; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act; the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Solid and Hazardous Waste Amendments of 1984; the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Federal Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act of 1986; the Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Control Act of 1980; the Federal Water Act of 1977; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; the Federal Waste Management Recovery and Recycling Act; the Washington Hazardous Waste Management Act; the Washington Hazardous Waste Fees Act; Washington Model Toxics Control Act; the Washington Nuclear Energy and Radiation Act; the Washington Radioactive Waste Storage and Transportation Act; the Washington Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks Act; and any regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time.

 6. Taxes and Assessments.

 A. Prior to the energization of any of the Petrovitsky Feeders and only to the extent Taxes (as defined below) when due and payable are not recoverable by Grantee through its general rates, Grantor shall pay or, if paid by Grantee, reimburse to Grantee, the amount of leasehold excise taxes and any other taxes, fees, assessments or charges (however termed) by governmental entities that are imposed on Grantor or Grantee specifically because of the property interests granted to Grantee hereunder, the ECF, Grantee's use of the ECF and the Easement Areas or Grantee's personal property in the Easement Areas (collectively, "Taxes"), whether imposed on Grantor or Grantee.

 C. Without limiting sections 6.A and 6.B, Grantor and Grantee acknowledge that, based on state law and regulation existing as of the Effective Date, they anticipate that a leasehold excise tax as referred to above will not be payable.

 D. In the event that Grantee breaches or otherwise does not fulfill its obligations under this section 6, Grantor reserves the right, but not the obligation, on reasonable notice to Grantee, to pay any such Taxes that are due and owing. All costs and expenses incurred by Grantor in connection with its actions pursuant to the previous sentence shall become due and payable by Grantee within one working day of Grantor's presentation of an invoice therefor. Any overdue payment shall be made with interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and actual days elapsed from (and including) the date on which such payment was due, to (and including) the date on which such payment is made.

In the case of joint or concurrent negligence of Grantor and Grantee (or either or both Grantor, Grantee and others), the resulting Loss shall be borne by the parties hereto in proportion to their respective degrees of negligence.

 B. Environmental Indemnity. In addition to all other indemnities provided in this ECF Easement, and notwithstanding its termination, the Indemnitor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnitees from and against all claims, causes of action, regulatory demands, judgements, liens, damages, penalties, fines, costs, expenses, liabilities or losses (including, without limitation, clean up or remedial costs, injuries to third persons, sums paid in settlement of claims, attorneys' fees, consultant fees, and expert fees) which are imposed on, paid by, or asserted against the Indemnitees (or any of them) in connection with (i) any violation of Environmental Law by the Indemnitor or Related Persons, (ii) any Use, storage or release of any Hazardous Substance by the Indemnitor or Related Persons or (iii) the existence of a Hazardous Substance on account of the Use, storage or release of a Hazardous Substance by the Indemnitor or Related Persons (or, with respect only to Grantor, any prior owner or occupant of the Property), on or about the Easement Areas or into the surrounding environment, whether (y) made, commenced or incurred during or prior to the term of this ECF Easement, or (z) made, commenced or incurred after the termination of this ECF Easement if arising out of an event occurring during or prior to the term of this ECF Easement.

 C. Waiver. As between the parties and solely for the purpose of effectuating the indemnities contained in subsections A and B of this section 7, Grantee and Grantor each expressly waives any immunity, defense or protection that may be granted to it under the Washington State Industrial Insurance Act, Revised Code of Washington Title 51 or any other industrial insurance, workers' compensation or similar laws of the State of Washington. This section shall not be interpreted or construed as a waiver of either Grantor's or Grantee's right to assert any such immunity, defense or protection directly against any of its own employees or such employee's estate or other representatives. This section 7.C has been mutually negotiated by the parties.

 Initialed by: ______________________ ______________________ Grantor Grantee

 8. Insurance. Grantee shall at all times maintain for the protection of Grantor such insurance policies as are specified in Attachment 5 hereto, under the terms and conditions set forth therein.

 9. Conformity with Law. Grantee shall exercise all of its rights and responsibilities hereunder in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

 10. Default. If Grantee commits a material breach of or default under this ECF Easement, the Grantor may give Grantee written notice of the breach or default (including a statement of the facts relating to the breach or default and the applicable provisions of this ECF Easement). Grantee shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the specified breach or default, or such longer period as is reasonably necessary to effect such cure if cure cannot be accomplished within such 30-day period, so long as such cure has been commenced within such 30-day period and is being diligently pursued; provided, that in the event of a breach or default that may affect public health or safety (including without limitation Grantee's failure to meet its obligations under section 5) or in an emergency situation, Grantee shall have one (1) working day after receipt of notice to commence curing the breach or default and shall proceed diligently to effect such cure. If Grantee has not cured the breach or default in accordance with the previous sentence, an "Event of Default" will be deemed to have occurred. If an Event of Default occurs, Grantor may seek all remedies available in law or equity, and such remedies shall be cumulative.

 11. Termination

 A. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, all of Grantee's rights under this ECF Easement shall terminate automatically in the event that Grantee ceases to use the ECF Area for a period of three (3) years or other mutually agreed upon time.

 B. In the event that Grantee ceases to use the ECF Area in accordance with section 11.A, Grantee shall, upon written notice from Grantor, remove, at the direction of Grantor, any or all of the ECF from the ECF Area, restore the ECF Area to a condition as good or better than it was prior to construction of the ECF, conduct environmental assessments of the ECF Area (performed in accordance with industry standards at the time of termination), clean-up any portion of the ECF Area so indicated in the environmental assessments, deliver a copy of the environmental assessments and report of clean-up activities (if any) to Grantor, and comply with any closure requirements of Grantor reasonably required to ensure that the ECF Area has been left in an environmentally sound condition and that no latent conditions exist that might adversely impact the ECF Area or Grantor's Cedar River water supply. Such removal and restoration shall be done at Grantee's sole expense and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Grantor. If Grantee fails, within a reasonable time, to remove any or all of the ECF or take such other measures as are mutually agreed upon, Grantor may, after reasonable notice to Grantee, remove the ECF and restore the ECF Area at the expense of Grantee. In lieu of removal of the ECF and site restoration as provided above, Grantor may, at its option, direct Grantee to transfer the ECF to Grantor, whereupon this ECF Easement shall be deemed terminated and Grantee shall have no further responsibility or liability hereunder arising after the date of transfer, except with respect to provisions hereof that survive termination.

 C. Upon the completion of Grantee's obligations under section 11.B, this ECF Easement shall terminate automatically. At Grantor's request, Grantee shall execute a release of this ECF Easement or a similar document, and either party may record such document.

 12. Successors and Assigns. Grantee may not assign, apportion or otherwise transfer its rights, benefits, privileges and interests arising in or under this ECF Easement without the prior written approval of Grantor, and any assignment, apportionment or transfer without Grantor's prior written approval shall be null, void and without effect. Grantor approves transfer of Grantee's rights, benefits, privileges and interests arising in or under this ECF Easement to Grantee's mortgage trustees or their successors and assigns under indentures in effect as of the date of this ECF Easement that grant to such mortgage trustees a security interest in this ECF Easement or in Grantee's rights or interests herein or hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the rights and obligations of the Grantor and Grantee shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon their respective successors and assigns.

 13. Nonwaiver. The failure of Grantor to insist upon or enforce strict performance by Grantee of any of this provisions hereof or to exercise any rights or remedies hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of Grantor's right to assert or rely upon any such provisions or rights in that or any other instance; rather, the same shall be and remain in full force and effect.

 14. Survival. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions hereof, sections 3, 6 and 7 and all other provisions hereof that reasonably may be interpreted or construed as surviving termination of this ECF Easement shall survive such termination.

 15. Attorneys Fees. Attorneys' fees owing to Grantor under this ECF Easement shall be calculated at the rate charged by attorneys and paralegals in private practice in a downtown Seattle law firm comparable in size to The City of Seattle Law Department who have been working as such for approximately the same period of time as the attorneys and paralegals representing Grantor.

 16. Notices. All notices, reports and approvals required in connection with this ECF Easement shall be in writing and deemed to have been duly given if personally delivered or sent by United States mail or overnight delivery service, each with proof of receipt, to the addresses shown below or as otherwise indicated in written notice from one party to the other:
