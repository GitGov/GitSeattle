 AN ORDINANCE relating to wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Section 21.28.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust the wastewater volume rate; and amending Section 21.76.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust credits to low-income wastewater customers.

 WHEREAS, the wastewater volume rate was last increased on January 1, 2007, as authorized by Ordinance 122292; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) has identified wastewater infrastructure needs requiring capital funding, including combined sewer overflow projects at Windermere and South Henderson and utility relocation and replacement work necessitated by the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Replacement Project; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing wastewater volume rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay debt service and the costs of providing wastewater services; and

 WHEREAS, proposed new drainage rates, consistent with Resolution 30886, fund a portion of the combined sanitary and storm sewer expenses, including some wastewater treatment expenses, which are currently funded entirely by wastewater rates revenue; and

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers not billed directly by SPU for water or wastewater services are based on typical residential bills, and credits for such customers need to be revised to reflect changes in the wastewater volume rate; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 21.28.040 B of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 21.28.040 Wastewater volume charge.

 * * * * *

 B. The wastewater volume rate shall be the sum of the treatment rate, the system rate and, where applicable, the MMRD surcharge, as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the wastewater share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal services ~~provided by King County~~and any associated costs required to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund financial policies. ~~("treatment cost"). Effective January 1, 2005, the treatment rate shall be $4.72 per CCF. For rates effective January 1, 2007 and thereafter, Seattle Public Utilities shall calculate annually a new treatment rate.~~ The ~~new~~ treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected wastewater treatment cost is divided by (b) the projected billed wastewater consumption, each for the next calendar year, and ~~(b)~~ the result is multiplied by one hundred sixteen and seven-tenths percent (116.7%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which ~~projected treatment cost~~ may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the total expected treatment cost ~~expected to be paid by Seattle Public Utilities in~~for the current year and the total wastewater volume charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. ~~No later than October 1 of each year, Seattle Public Utilities shall submit a written report of the proposed treatment rate for the following year and its effect on the total wastewater volume rate to the Chair of the Environment, Emergency Management and Utilities Committee. Such treatment rate shall be effective the following January 1, unless otherwise directed by ordinance.~~The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such changes.

 2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to pay the cost of carrying and discharging all wastewater and any wastewater funded-share of  stormwater into the City sewerage system, as presently maintained and operated and as may be added to, improved and extended. ~~The system rate shall be in accordance with the following schedule:~~Effective Date Rate per CCF January 1, 2004 $1.68 January 1, 2005 $1.86 January 1, 2006 $2.04

3. The wastewater volume rate shall be in accordance with the following schedule:

 Effective Effective Effective Jan. 1, 2007 Jan. 1, 2008 Jan. 1, 2009 Treatment Rate $5.41 $5.22 $5.24 System Rate $2.04 $2.53 $2.86 Wastewater Volume Rate $7.45 $7.75 $8.10

~~3.~~4. MMRD Surcharge: Master metered premises with an eligible project (as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.04.280) that have received funding from Seattle Public Utilities for sewer improvements under Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.16.270 B shall pay a volume rate for sewer improvements of $3.34 per CCF.

 * * * * *

 Section 2. Subsection 21.76.040 A of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 21.76.040 Utility low income rate assistance.

 A. Drainage, Wastewater, and Water. Persons qualified by the Human Services Department as eligible recipients of low income utility credits provided for in Section 21.76.010 (eligible recipients) shall be granted low income billing credits in the following amounts:

 1. Wastewater. Eligible recipients billed directly by Seattle Public Utilities for wastewater services and residing in single- family dwellings shall receive a credit equal to 0.5 times the total current wastewater volume charge~~billing~~. Eligible recipients not billed directly by Seattle Public Utilities for wastewater services shall receive the following credits based on dwelling type:

 Effective Date Single-family Multifamily dwelling and duplex

~~January 1, 2005 $17.12 per month $11.52 per month~~

 January 1, 2007 $19.37 per month $13.41 per month

January 1, 2008 $20.15 per month $13.95 per month January 1, 2009 $21.06 per month $14.58 per month

 At the time of a change to the wastewater volume rate~~charge~~ described in SMC 21.28.040, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall calculate new credits based on dwelling type for eligible recipients not billed directly by Seattle Public Utilities. The credit for Single-family and duplex customers shall be 0.5 times the wastewater volume rate~~charge~~ multiplied by 5.2 CCF, which is typical single family residential sewer billed consumption. The credit for Multifamily dwelling customers shall be 0.5 times the wastewater volume rate~~charge~~ multiplied by 3.6 CCF, which is typical multifamily sewer billed consumption.

 * * * * *

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
