 AN ORDINANCE relating to Municipal Court operations; increasing and decreasing appropriations in the 2006 budget; establishing salary levels for Seattle Municipal Court Judges serving in elected positions equivalent to ninety-five percent of district court judicial salaries; and creating a Trial Court Improvement Account; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the State of Washington passed Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5454 (E2SSB 5454) in April 2005; and

 WHEREAS, E2SSB 5454 provides state funding to help offset the cost of municipal court judicial salaries if certain requirements are met; and

 WHEREAS, to qualify for a state contribution towards municipal court judicial salaries, E2SSB 5454 requires jurisdictions in the State of Washington to set municipal court judicial salaries, for judges serving in elected positions, at a rate equivalent to at least ninety-five percent, but not more than one hundred percent, of district court judicial salaries; and

 WHEREAS, at any time in the future, the City of Seattle ("the City") may decide not to fund Seattle Municipal Court judicial salaries at the level necessary to qualify for a state contribution per E2SSB 5454; and

 WHEREAS, the City will periodically evaluate its participation in this program to ensure that it does not result in a negative fiscal impact to the City; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Beginning July 1, 2006, Seattle Municipal Court judges serving in elected positions will receive a salary equivalent to 95% of district court judge salaries, to be determined in a manner consistent with Article 30, Section 1 of the Washington State Constitution. Partial additional funding to accomplish this in 2006 is provided in Section 2 of this ordinance.

 Section 2. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred in 2006, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriation for the following in the 2006 budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Amount Level

 General Seattle Court Operations $39,032 Subfund Municipal (M2000) Court

 The General Subfund is expected to be reimbursed for this appropriation by the State of Washington with monies made available for judicial salaries under E2SSB 5454.

 Section 3. As long as the Seattle Municipal Court judicial salaries are set at a level of at least 95% of district court judicial salaries, Seattle Municipal Court judges shall not receive any cost of living adjustments or other salary increases.

 Section 4. The Department of Executive Administration shall create a Trial Court Improvement Account (TCIA) Budget Control Level in the Finance General Department of the General Subfund. Money in the TCIA shall be appropriated, in the annual budget or by separate ordinance from time to time, solely to fund allowable Seattle Municipal Court related expenditures per E2SSB 5454.

 A. To set aside $39,032 into the TCIA, which is an amount equal to the quarterly payments anticipated to be received in 2006 from the state for judicial salaries, the appropriations for the 2006 budget are modified as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 General Finance Reserves (2QD00) ($39,032) Subfund General "Reserve for Community (00100) Court-related Services."

 General Finance Trial Court $39,032 Subfund General Improvement Account (00100)

 B. For 2007 and future years, the Mayor may propose in the annual budget an amount to be placed in the TCIA based upon anticipated state funding under E2SSB5454 for the budget year.

 Section 5. As part of the City's annual budget process, the Mayor and/or City Council may elect not to participate in the judicial salary funding program per E2SSB 5454. Accordingly, the City may adopt salary levels for Seattle Municipal Court judges that are not tied to salary levels of district court judges.

 Section 6. The Department of Finance (DoF) is requested to report by September 1 of each year on projected and actual revenues received from the state for Seattle Municipal Court judicial salaries and determine the added costs, if any, that the City incurs complying with the requirements of this program. The City Council may request that DoF provide additional periodic updates to the City Council.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
