 Reg Side Sewer Code

 November 28, 2005

 Version. 7

 1

 Attachment A

 Changes Made by the Proposed Legislation

 * A new first-time registration fee of $200 for registered side sewer contractors (RSSC) and an annual renewal fee of $150 are added to cover the costs of administering the registration program.

 * The examination fee is increased from $60 to $100 in order to recover the cost of administering the exam.

 * RSSC's are required to give DPD a list of employees who have passed the examination.

 * All work on side sewers located in a public way must be supervised by a person who has passed the examination.

 * The liability insurance requirements are modified. The current regulations require comprehensive general liability insurance with bodily injury limits of $300,000 for each person injured, and $1,000,000 for more than one person injured, plus liability limits of at least $100,000 for all damages to property. The proposed legislation requires commercial general liability coverage of $1,000,000 for each occurrence of single-limit bodily injury combined with property damage. This change was made at the suggestion of the City's Risk Management office, and is consistent with the requirements for grading in environmentally critical areas.

 * The amount of the bond required of RSSCs is increased from $15,000 to $30,000. The bond requirements have not changed in fifteen years or more. The increased bond amount is a more realistic estimate of the cost of restoring streets and other public places and potential City liability if the contractor fails to complete the work. A higher bond is also necessary because contractors often work on several projects at one time. The Risk Management Division consulted with the bonding and insurance community to help determine the appropriate amount.

 * Indemnification of the City for any claims resulting from the RSSC's work is required of all RSSCs.

 * The grounds and procedures for cancelling or suspending RSSC's registrations are modified; and the procedures for appealing are modified.

 * Failure to have a current City business license or a current State contractor's license are added to the list of reasons for which DPD can refuse to issue a permit for work in a public place to an RSSC..

 * The requirement that RSSCs restore disturbed areas is modified to require disturbed areas be restored according to SDOT standards. The current code contains vague language about restoration to a condition as good as when the work began.

 * Civil enforcement procedures and penalties are added.

 * The length of time a side sewer permit is valid is lengthened from 90 days to 18 months, the same as building permits.
