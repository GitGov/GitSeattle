 WHEREAS, this year, the University District Ratepayers Advisory Group requested an additional 10% increase in the assessment rates, as well as a 10% increase in the minimum and maximum assessments allowed by Ordinance 118412, to prevent reduction in PBIA services caused by inflation in prices since 2001; and

 WHEREAS, a public hearing regarding the proposed rate adjustment was held on __________, 2006, and comments regarding the increase have been considered by City Council; and

 WHEREAS, based upon information provided by the University District Ratepayers Advisory Group and comments received during the public hearing, the City Council believes it is in the best interests both of the PBIA and the City to adjust the rate structure to maintain appropriate levels of service; NOW, THEREFORE,
