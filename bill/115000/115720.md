 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE adopting the tunnel alternative as the City of Seattle's preferred alternative for replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seattle Seawall.

 WHEREAS, the Alaskan Way Viaduct is a deteriorating structure that was significantly damaged in the Nisqually Earthquake of 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the Viaduct is seismically at risk and engineers estimate it has a 1 in 20 chance of failure in an earthquake in the next ten years; and

 WHEREAS, the nearby Seattle Seawall is also a deteriorating structure that continues to be damaged by "gribbles" and other underwater marine borers; and

 WHEREAS, because of the proximity of the Viaduct and Seawall, a failure of either is likely to cause failure of the other; and

 WHEREAS, the Alaskan Way corridor carries more than 100,000 vehicle trips a day, or one quarter of the vehicle trips moving through the downtown Seattle area on limited access highways; and

 WHEREAS, continued deterioration or failure of the Viaduct and Seawall represent a threat to our region's public safety and economy; and

 WHEREAS, replacement of the Viaduct and Seawall is a decision that will impact the City for up to 100 years and will profoundly affect the region's transportation network and the future enjoyment of the waterfront as a destination for residents of Seattle and the region; and

 WHEREAS, for the continued mobility of people and freight, the replacement of the Viaduct and Seawall must preserve capacity for our region's transportation network; and

 WHEREAS, the replacement must also preserve vital north-south connections for residents of West Seattle, Ballard and other communities; and

 WHEREAS, the replacement is an opportunity to reconnect Seattle to its waterfront and remove a structure that casts a blighting shadow on Seattle's downtown; and

 WHEREAS, the public is the owner of the greatest amount of land on the waterfront and development there should serve the public's use and enjoyment of public facilities; and

 WHEREAS, building another double-decker freeway on the waterfront is not desirable to the City as it would continue pollution, noise and shadowing, all of which degrade the public enjoyment of the waterfront; and

 WHEREAS, building another double-decker freeway would conflict with the Comprehensive Plan's goals of making Center City neighborhoods more attractive as places to live and more attractive and efficient for use by pedestrians, bicyclists and transit; and

 WHEREAS, building another double-decker freeway on the waterfront would conflict with numerous City comprehensive plan policy and codes, including shoreline environment height limits, zone height limits, view corridors, and protected public views; and

 WHEREAS, in order to finance such a substantial investment, the replacement project must enjoy a wide base of community support to build a coalition for local, regional, state and federal financing; and

 WHEREAS, since the 2001 earthquake, the City of Seattle together with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) (collectively "the partner agencies") have completed substantial engineering, planning, and environmental analysis, including preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) comparing five alternatives for replacement of the Viaduct and Seawall structures, and a Supplemental DEIS further analyzing the impacts of an elevated structure and a tunnel structure, including impacts of closing the corridor during construction; and

 WHEREAS, the public has been actively involved in the activities undertaken by the partner agencies, including participation in more than 300 public meetings, briefings and hearings; preparation and submittal of thousands of written and oral comments; participation in the City's Central Waterfront Planning process, and a public involvement process lead by the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the tunnel alternative would replace SR99 for 4.1 miles between approximately S.

 Spokane Street in the south to Comstock Street in the north, include 3 lanes in each direction along the central waterfront, with the tunnel extending from approximately S. Dearborn Street at the South to approximately Pine Street to the north, connecting to the four lane (two lanes in each direction) Battery Street Tunnel. On- and off- ramps to/from the stadium area and downtown will be located at S. King Street in the south, with a northbound off-ramp at Western Avenue and a southbound on-ramp at Elliott Avenue in the north in addition to a northbound on-ramp and southbound off-ramp at Denny Way; and

 WHEREAS, in January 2005 the City Council adopted Resolution 30726 declaring the tunnel alternative as the City's preferred alternative for replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seattle Seawall Project; and

 WHEREAS, the State Legislature delegated authority to the City legislative authority in Engrossed Substitute House Bill (ESHB) 2871 to adopt by ordinance a preferred alternative for the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seattle Seawall Replacement Project (Project); and

 WHEREAS, The City Council has reviewed and considered the report of the Expert Review Panel (ERP) created by ESHB 2871 concerning the finance plan and project implementation plan for the Project; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has held public hearings on September 11, 2006 and September 22, 2006 on the ERP's findings and recommendations concerning the finance plan and project implementation plan as required in ESHB 2871; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has received and considered the mitigation plans included in the Draft EIS as well as the most recent available mitigation plans prepared by WSDOT and the most recent comprehensive cost estimate review prepared by WSDOT in conjunction with the Project; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to reaffirm a vision for the central waterfront that will reclaim the waterfront and reconnect it with downtown consistent with Resolution 30664 and Resolution 30724; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City hereby adopts the tunnel alternative as its preferred alternative for the replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seattle Seawall. This alternative includes demolition of the existing Viaduct structure and its replacement with a tunnel through the central waterfront.

 Section 2. The City explicitly rejects the aerial rebuild alternative for the central waterfront.

 Section 3. In the event a tunnel proves to be infeasible, the City recommends the development of a transit and surface street alternative that meets the intent of Resolutions 30664 and 30724.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2006, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2006.
