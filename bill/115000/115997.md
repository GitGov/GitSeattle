 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Fleets and Facilities Department Director to execute an amendment to a lease agreement with the General Services Administration of the U.S. Government for warehouse space at Federal Center South, 4735 East Marginal Way South, in Seattle.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Police Department leases two warehouse spaces at Federal Center South for the purpose of storing vehicles and equipment obtained as evidence, under two separate lease agreements; and

 WHEREAS, the General Services Administration has agreed to combine, by amendment, the two leases into one lease agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Police Department anticipates a need for one or both leased warehouse spaces for up to five additional years; and

 WHEREAS, the amount of warehouse space the Seattle Police Department needs cannot be accommodated within City-owned buildings now and for the foreseeable future; and

 WHEREAS, Federal Center South is especially suitable to the Seattle Police Department's needs because of the low rental rate and the security available at the site; and

 WHEREAS, the General Services Administration only leases property at Federal Center South for one-year terms with the provision for negotiated agreement of renewal; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 3.18.240 requires City Council approval of the lease amendment, because the total warehouse square footage leased in one calendar year will exceed 9,000 square feet; and

 WHEREAS, it is standard City practice for the Fleets and Facilities Department to procure leased warehouse space on behalf of the Seattle Police Department, pay rent to the landlord for such leased space, and subsequently receive reimbursement from the Seattle Police Department; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 2. The Fleets and Facilities Department Director is authorized to extend the term of the existing lease for one year and to renew the lease each year for up to five additional years under the same terms and conditions, with adjustments for rents based upon current market rates for similar space.

 Section 3. The rental payments contemplated by the terms of the lease agreement authorized in Section 1 hereof shall be charged to the appropriate expenditure allowance or allowances in the budget of the Fleets and Facilities Department and shall be reimbursed to that Department by the Seattle Police Department.
