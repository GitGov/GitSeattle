 WHEREAS, the City intends to be in compliance with Chapter 35.102 RCW in the imposition and administration of its gross receipts B & O taxes; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Legislature passed Chapter 256, Session Laws of 2006, which amended the deficiency assessment penalty provisions contained in RCW 82.32.090 and the City is required to adopt such amendment; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new section 5.30.065 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 5.30.065 Definitions - References to Chapter 82.32 RCW.

 Where provisions of Chapter 82.32 RCW are incorporated in Chapter 5.55 of this Title, "Department" as used in the RCW shall refer to the "Director" as defined in SMC 5.30.025 and "warrant" as used in the RCW shall mean "citation or criminal complaint."

 Section 2. Section 5.55.090 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 5.55.090 Interest on underpayment of tax.

 A. If, upon examination of any returns, or from other information obtained by the Director, it appears that a~~an amount of~~ tax or penalty less than that properly due has been paid, the Director shall assess the additional amount found to be due and shall add ~~interest~~ thereto interest on the tax only~~as provided in subsection B of this section. Interest shall be added to delinquent tax only and shall not be calculated upon penalty or interest~~. The Director shall notify the person by mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, or within such time as the Director may provide in writing.

B. After December 31, 2004 the Director shall compute interest in accordance with RCW 82.32.050 as it now exists or as it may be amended. If SMC 5.55.090 B is held to be invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.050 existing at the effective date of this ordinance shall apply.~~Interest calculations on underpayments:~~1. Interest on underpayments of taxes for periods prior to January 1, 2002 shall be computed from the date of underpayment until paid at a rate of ten (10) percent per year on the balance due.

 2. Interest on underpayments of taxes for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002 shall be computed from the last day of the month following the end of the reporting period and will continue to accrue until payment is made. In case of a deficiency assessment the interest shall be computed from the first day of the month following each calendar year or portion thereof included in the assessment. The rate of interest to be charged to the taxpayer shall be an average of the federal short-term rate as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1274(d) plus two (2) percentage points. The rate set for each new year shall be computed by taking an arithmetical average to the nearest percentage point of the federal short-term rate, compounded annually. That average shall be calculated using the rates from four (4) months: January, April, and July of the calendar year immediately preceding the new year, and October of the previous preceding year.

 Section 3. Section 5.55.095 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 5.55.095 Time in which assessment may be made.

~~1~~A. Against a person who is not currently registered or licensed or has not filed a tax return as required by this chapter ~~,~~ for taxes due within the period commencing ten (10) years prior to the close of the calendar year in which the person was contacted in writing by the Director;

~~2~~B. Against a person that has committed fraud or who misrepresented a material fact ~~, for all taxes due~~; or

~~3~~C. Against a person that has executed a written waiver of such limitations ~~, for taxes due within the period authorized by the waiver~~.

~~B. The Director shall notify the person by mail of the amount of the deficiency, which shall become due and shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, or within such additional time as the Director may provide in writing.~~

Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest ~~accrued and~~ paid more than four (4) years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

 B. The execution of a written waiver ~~, pursuant to SMC 5.55.095,)~~ shall extend the time for applying for, or making, a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the Director discovers that a refund or credit is due.
