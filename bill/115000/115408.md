 c. Nonresidential uses in zones designated NC2/R and NC3/R with a height limit of sixty-five (65) feet may be increased in size up to two (2) times the lot area if the nonresidential use is in a mixed use structure according to the provisions of Section 23.47.008, and if a minimum of thirty-five (35) percent of the gross floor area of the mixed use structure is in residential use, not including parking.

 3. For each lot, office uses in C1 and C2 zones shall be limited to the size of the lot area or thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet, whichever is greater. Office uses in C1 and C2 zones are exempt from this limit if the structure meets the following standards for NC zones:

5.Impacts to adjacent residential areas from loading activities are mitigated using screening, buffers or other techniques;

6.The Director finds that the expansion or replacement is compatible with the character and scale of the area in which it is located; and
