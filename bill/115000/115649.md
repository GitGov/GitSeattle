The final assessments and the Final Assessment Roll of Local Improvement District No. 6750, for the purpose of constructing a modern streetcar line serving downtown Seattle, Denny Triangle and South Lake Union, as provided by Ordinance 121951 as amended by Ordinance 122046, and as modified in accordance with Section 1above, are hereby approved and confirmed in the total amount of Twenty-six Million, One Hundred Ninety-seven Thousand, Nine Hundred Twenty-nine Dollars and Twelve Cents ($26,197,929.12).

 Section 3. Each of the lots, tracts, parcels of land and other property shown upon the assessment roll is determined and declared to be specially benefited by this improvement in at least the amount charged against the same, and the assessment appearing against the same is in proportion to the several assessments appearing upon the roll. There is levied and assessed against each lot, tract or parcel of land and other property appearing upon the roll the amount finally charged against the same thereon.

 Section 4. The City Clerk shall transmit the assessment roll as approved and confirmed to the Director of Executive Administration for collection and the Director of Executive Administration shall publish notice as required by law stating that the roll is in his hands for collection and that payment of any assessment thereon or any portion of such assessment can be made at any time within 30 days from the date of first publication of such notice without penalty, interest or cost, and that thereafter the sum remaining unpaid may be paid in 18 equal annual installments.

 FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND DECISION

 Introduction

 On March 17, 2006, the proposed final assessment roll levying the special assessments against the property located in Local Improvement District No. 6750 in the City of Seattle, Washington, was filed with the City Clerk.

 The Council fixed a date and location of May 2, 2006 at 10:00 a.m. in the Seattle Municipal Court for a hearing on protests and objections to the proposed final assessment roll. The City Clerk's Office mailed individual notice of the hearing to each property owner shown on the roll.

 On May 2, 2006 the City Council's Hearing Officer held a hearing and considered the roll and the special benefits to be received by each lot, parcel and tract of land. All written protests received were considered and all persons appearing at the hearing who wished to be heard were heard by the Officer.

 The City Council's Hearing Officer issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to the City Council on May 16, 2006 ("Hearing Officer Report").

 The City Clerk's Office mailed the Hearing Officer Report to each property owner who filed a timely protest. A timely appeal from the Hearing Officer Report was filed by Robin Hirao, and Douglas Otani ("Appellants"), owner and manager, respectively, of the property listed as Parcel # 622 on the assessment roll and located at 400 Fairview Avenue North. A written response to the appeal was filed by counsel for Local Improvement District 6750.

 By Resolution 30877, the Council fixed the time and place for a hearing on the appeal by the Transportation Committee. On July 11, 2006, the Transportation Committee considered the appeal, the written response, and the record from the Hearing Officer's open record hearing.

 Findings of Fact

 The Council hereby adopts the Findings of Fact as stated in the Hearing Officer Report dated May 16, 2006. Additionally, the Council makes the following further findings:

 1. In their appeal to the Council the Appellants assert that a) a postal service delivery error precluded them from presenting expert appraisal testimony; b) their property, a wholesale floral warehouse, is not specially benefited; and c) the beginning appraised value should be the 2005 assessed value of the property.

 2. Appellant Douglas Otani presented testimony on behalf of his wife in addition to that of their chosen representative, Harley Hoppe, and entered their written protest into the record as an exhibit at the May 2, 2006 hearing. There is nothing in the record that indicates that any delay in receipt of their written protest precluded them from presenting expert appraisal testimony from anyone other than Mr. Hoppe.

 3. The record is similarly bereft of any evidence that the method of assessment used by the District's expert appraisal witness does not fairly reflect the special benefits to the Hirao property resulting from the streetcar improvement.

 Conclusions

 The Council hereby adopts the Hearing Officer's Conclusions as stated in the Hearing Officer Report dated May 16, 2006. Additionally, the Council makes the following further conclusions:

 1. The Council has jurisdiction over this matter. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) section 20.04.090.

 2. On appeals to the Council, the recommendation from the Hearing Officer must be accorded substantial weight and the appellant carries the burden of proof. SMC section20.04.090.F.

 3. In reviewing appeals the Council applies the standard of review applied by the Hearing Officer below. Specifically, an assessment roll must be upheld unless the assessment can be shown to stand on a fundamentally wrong basis or the assessing body acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Abbenhaus v. Yakima, 89 Wn.2d 855, 858, (1978).

 4. Appellants presented testimony to the Hearing Officer, entered exhibits and received a full and fair hearing on their protest.

 5. The Hearing Officer did not err in rejecting the argument that the assessment should be based on the Appellants' current use of the property as a florist's warehouse and distribution center. Future development and use may be considered in valuing special benefits to a property. Seattle v. Rogers Clothing for Men, Inc., 114 Wn.2d at 231 (1990).

 6. Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the assessment of their property was done on a fundamentally wrong basis or that the assessment was arbitrary and capricious.

 Decision

 The Final Assessment Roll for Local Improvement District No. 6750, with the revision recommended by the Hearing Officer at Conclusion 7 of the Hearing Officer Report, is hereby approved. The appeal of the Appellants is hereby denied.

 Dated this __________ day of _________________________, 2006.
