 PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

 This Property Use and Development Agreement (the "Agreement") is executed this ____ day of _______________, 2005, in favor of the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (herein called "City"), by Pryde Johnson Ashworth LLC, a Washington limited liability company, ("Owner").

 RECITALS

 Pryde Johnson Ashworth LLC is the Owner of that certain real property in the City of Seattle legally described on Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference ("Property" herein). The Property address is 8016 Ashworth Avenue North in the Green Lake neighborhood of Seattle.

 B. According to the City of Seattle zoning maps, the Property currently has an SF-5000 zoning designation.

 C. The 34,552 square foot Property is currently developed with an approximately 15,000 sq. ft., one-story brick building originally built as a utility service facility and over the past 35 years has been used as the operational center of a limousine service.

 D. On February 26, 2004, Pryde Development, LLC, Owner's predecessor in interest, submitted to the City of Seattle an application to rezone the Property to L-1, subject to a Property Use and Development Agreement. The purpose of the application is to allow the Property to be redeveloped with a 20-unit, residential development consisting of 12 detached "cottage-style" single-family units, two clusters of four attached "carriage-style" units, one accessory building and accessory parking, all arranged around two connected landscaped common spaces with pedestrian access to both Ashworth Avenue North and Densmore Avenue North. Because the units are to be developed as a common project and individually do not meet the lot size requirements of the SF 5000 zone, rezoning of the Property is required.

 E. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 F. Owner desires the City to rezone the Property to L-1, pursuant to SMC 23.34.004 to facilitate redevelopment of the Property and the City is willing to rezone the Property pursuant to the Owner's Agreement to ensure the rezoning of the Property does not permit unrestricted development to occur.

 AGREEMENT

 Zone Changes Limited to Current Proposal. Pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, the Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successor and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from SF 5000 to L-1: The changes in zone designation are established only for development of a project substantially the same in height, design, materials and site layout and with substantially the same amenities and improvements, both public and private, as depicted in the application for MUP 2307253 and represented in the Clerk's File 306618.

 Agreement Runs With the Land. This Property Use and Development Agreement ("Agreement") shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after- acquired title of the Owner of the Property; provided the covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect five (5) years from the effective date of the approval of this rezone unless an application is filed for a building permit for the building contemplated in the MUP 2307253 and that buildings are completed and Certificates of Occupancy obtained from DPD within the time the permit is active and valid.

 Amendment, Exercise of Police Power, No Precedent. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owner and the City, provided such amended agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Land Use Code or exercising the City's police power as it may deem necessary in the public interest. Owner agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to authorize any use or dimension not otherwise permitted in a L-1 zone. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property, and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the Owners of the Property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such Property Owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.
