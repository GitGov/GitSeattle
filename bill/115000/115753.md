This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2007. The following sentence is provided for information only: This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Thirty-seven and one- half Cents ($3.375) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043 (which includes up to Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060); and Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes and the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Three Million Seven Hundred Four Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty-two Dollars ($3,704,722) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low-income households, in accordance with Ordinance 120823; an amount of Sixteen Million Six Hundred Eighty-four Thousand Dollars ($16,684,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 121529; an amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) to improve the Opera House, replace the Flag Pavilion, and expand nine Parks Department community recreation centers in accordance with Ordinance 119522; an amount of Twenty-seven Million Six Hundred Twenty-three Thousand Five Hundred Seventy-one Dollars ($27,623,571) for neighborhood parks, green spaces, trails, and the Woodland Park Zoo in accordance with Ordinance 120024; and an amount of Twenty-one Million Dollars ($21,000,000) for firefighting, life-safety and other emergency response facilities in accordance with Ordinance 121230.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Eight Million Five Hundred Eighty Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-two Dollars ($8,580,992), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105 and pursuant to Ordinance 120823, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsections 1.A (i) and (ii), or the total of the tax rate stated in subsection 1.A (i) and the rate necessary to generate the amount of taxes stated in subsection 1.A (ii), would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law or approved by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, then such taxes shall be reduced to the maximum amount allowed or approved or the amount computed by applying the maximum rate to the value of the taxable property. The maximum amount of regular property taxes approved by vote of the people shall be determined for purposes of this subsection as follows: There shall be determined the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 2007 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 120823, 121529, 119522, 120024, and 121230. This amount shall be computed as One Hundred One percent (101%) of the general purpose regular property taxes levied for collection in 2006, plus the levy for tax refunds authorized by RCW 84.68.040 and RCW 84.55.070, plus the allowance for new construction and increases in state-assessed property value authorized by RCW 84.55.010 as calculated by the King County Assessor. Then, to that total amount shall be added the five (5) dollar amounts set forth in the last sentence of subsection 1.A (i) as authorized for 2007 collection in the approvals given by the voters of the City pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and those enumerated ordinances, plus the dollar amount set forth in subsection 1.A (ii).

In addition, a further tax is hereby levied to raise revenue to provide for the interest on and redemption of voter-approved general obligation bonds for the fiscal year 2007 in the amount of Twenty-six Million Three Hundred Forty-five Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty-six Dollars ($26,345,966). This tax is applicable to all taxable property within the City of Seattle.
