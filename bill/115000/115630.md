 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or the Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to lend and cause the disbursement of up to Four Million One Hundred Forty Four Thousand Dollars ($4,144,000) from the proceeds of the City's Replacement Note to Northgate South Commons, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Obligor"), pursuant to the Loan Agreement authorized in Section 2 of this ordinance, to finance development costs of the Northgate Commons Project located at 301 NE 103rd Street ("Property"). The Mayor or the OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to cause there to be drawn from the federal treasury and deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, No. 17820, companion Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant funds in the amount of Four Hundred Sixty- Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-One Dollars ($467,871), and pursuant to the appropriation in Section 4 of this ordinance, to cause the disbursement of such amount for the purposes of reducing or subsidizing interest obligations on the Section 108 loan and to provide loan loss reserves on the Section 108 loan. The amount of such BEDI Grant funds is based on the ratio of the maximum amount of the Section 108 loan ($4,144,000) to the maximum proceeds of the City's original Section 108 note and Replacement Note (i.e., $15,500,000).

 Section 2.

 (A) The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed: (1) a Loan Agreement with the Obligor based on the form attached as Exhibit B to this ordinance and the Project Description attached as Attachment B to Exhibit B, with such additions and modifications as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance; and (2) such amendments and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Section 108 loan shall be secured by a deed of trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED Director, against the Property. Such deed of trust may be subordinated to one or more other mortgages or deeds of trust, and the OED Director may grant partial reconveyances and modifications to the extent of the security when the Obligor shall have created one or more condominiums to separate the uses on the Property, if the OED Director determines that the remaining security will be adequate in light of the senior liens on the remaining security. The provisions for security shall be designed with the intent that there will be a loan-to-value ratio no higher than 80%, computed at the time of project stabilization (i.e., achievement of a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2) by dividing the total principal amount of debt secured by such senior mortgages and deeds of trust, together with the principal amount of the Section 108 loan, by the total fair market values of all property subject to the City's deed of trust. The Section 108 loan shall also be recourse to Obligor and shall be guaranteed by the principals of the Obligor, Lorig Associates, L.L.C. and Bruce C. and Andrea H. Lorig, under an unconditional guaranty in form satisfactory to the OED Director ("Guaranty"). The Guaranty may provide that if the Section 108 loan is not in default, the guarantors will be released upon the satisfaction of specified criteria, including a minimum of three consecutive years in which the Obligor meets or exceed the above debt service coverage ratio.

 (B) Without limiting the authority in this Section, the Mayor and OED Director is each authorized to allow the Obligor to grant a lease to Century Theatres, or any substitute movie theater operator approved by the Mayor or OED Director, subject to the City's deed of trust, for air rights to a portion of the Property above the level of improvements to be financed with the Section 108 loan.

 Section 3. The Loan Agreement shall provide, consistent with HUD regulations, that the Obligor shall take affirmative steps to assure that minority and women's business enterprises are used when possible, that Obligor shall maintain records of those steps, and that nothing in the Loan Agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to applicable law.

 Section 4. To the extent that BEDI Grant funds (in addition to BEDI Grant funds previously received and disbursed under Ordinances 120873 and 121201), are received by the City in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, the appropriation for the following in the 2006 Budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 Special Office of Economic 6XD20 $467,871 Purpose Development (BEDI Grant Grants funds) Fund, No. 17820

 Section 5. The revised maturity schedule for the Replacement Note, attached to this ordinance as Exhibit A, is hereby approved. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized to implement the terms of the Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance with HUD made pursuant to Ordinance 120873, as amended, and the Loan Agreement, and to negotiate and execute such additional amendments and agreements and perform such other acts as the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and to implement the Section 108 loan guaranty. The additional amendments and agreements authorized by this Section 5 shall be in the form and contain such terms and conditions as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance.

 Section 6. The Mayor or OED Director may require the Obligor to pay a loan origination fee of no more than one percent (1%) of the loan amount, i.e., no more than Forty-One Thousand Four Hundred Forty Dollars ($41,440). Such fee shall be paid directly to the Custodian to be held in trust for the purposes set forth in this Section 6. The OED Director is authorized to cause all of this fee to be disbursed to the National Development Council for consulting services related to the loan authorized hereby, in accordance with the City's existing contract with the National Development Council.

 Section 7. The Director of the Human Services Department ("HSD Director") is authorized to (a) further amend the City's 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan, including the 2006 Table of Proposed Projects, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this ordinance and (b) provide OED with technical assistance to ensure compliance with Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") regulations applicable to the Section 108 loan program. The Mayor, OED Director, and the HSD Director are authorized to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement the actions authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 8. This ordinance is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, any contractual or otherwise binding obligation upon, or commitment by, the City for the benefit of Obligor, Lorig Associates, L.L.C. or any other party interested in the Northgate Commons Project. The commitments to the Obligor authorized by this ordinance, subject to the limitations herein and under applicable law, shall become effective only if and when the agreements authorized hereby are duly executed and delivered by the City and other necessary parties.

 Section 9. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance taken after the passage of this ordinance is

 hereby ratified and confirmed. If any provision of this ordinance is determined to be invalid or

 unenforceable the remainder shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 A. Obligor will purchase the real property described in Attachment A, attached hereto and made a part hereof by this reference (the "Property"). On the Property, Obligor will develop improvements that will include approximately 278 rental housing units, 50,150 square feet of retail space and a 60-65,000 square foot movie theater (all such development is referred to as the "Project"). Obligor will use the proceeds of the Loan (described in Section 1.1 below) to develop a portion of the Project, more specifically 28,650 square feet of ground floor retail space (the "Facility"). The Facility, together with such movie theater to be located above the Facility, are referred to as "Building 1".

 B. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") has agreed, subject to certain conditions, to guarantee a non-recourse note or notes (collectively, as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any replacements thereof issued by the City and guaranteed by HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract described below, the "City Note") issued by City in part to fund the Loan, in accordance with Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (such Act and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder are hereinafter collectively called the "Act"). As of the date hereof, the City Note is a Variable/Fixed Rate Note, no. B-02-MC-53-0005 in the maximum commitment amount of $7,484,000, which is one of two notes that are the subject of a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance between the City and HUD (as amended by an Amendment dated August 21, 2003 and as it may be further supplemented or amended from time to time, the "HUD Contract") and certain Letter Agreements for Section 108 Guarantee Program Custodial Account (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Letter Agreements") among the City, HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (hereinafter referred to, with any successors under such agreement or successor agreement, and in its capacity as trustee in connection with the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, as "Custodian"). City has also entered into an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement with the Custodian (as supplemented or amended from time to time, together with any substitute therefor in accordance with Section 7.2 below, the "Custodial Agreement"), which provides for, among other things, the Custodian to hold certain security for the City Note on behalf of HUD and for the establishment and management of certain accounts pursuant to the HUD Contract and Letter Agreements. The HUD Contract is entered into pursuant to an application submitted to HUD by the City dated June 18, 2002, a copy of which Obligor has received and reviewed (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Application"). The Application, HUD Contract, Letter Agreements and Custodial Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the HUD Contract or City Note, as applicable.

 C. The Office of Economic Development of the City ("OED") is responsible within The City of Seattle for making, subject to City Council approval, loans of funds obtained from HUD by pledges of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds to be made available to the City by HUD, pursuant to the Act. Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED. The Director of OED, or his or her duly authorized designee, and any official of the City succeeding to the functions of such Director, is referred to herein as the "OED Director."

 D. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by Obligor's Promissory Note ("Obligor Note") in the form attached hereto as Attachment C and hereby incorporated by reference, and together with Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing in the form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any other assignments of leases, tenant estoppels, subordination and attornment agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement, the "Deed of Trust") on the Property, dated on or about the date hereof. The Obligor Note, this Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity (defined in Section 3.1 of this Agreement) and any other documents or instruments executed by Obligor in favor of City pursuant hereto, are collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents". Where the context so requires, to the extent that the Loan Documents provide that Obligor's obligations or duties thereunder are determined by reference to any terms or provisions of documents incorporated by reference in any of the Loan Documents, any reference to the "Loan Documents" shall include such terms or provisions. The delivery by the Obligor of all documents and satisfaction of all other conditions for disbursement hereunder, and the first disbursement of City Note proceeds to or for the benefit of Obligor hereunder, is referred to as "Closing."

 E. Obligor's obligations under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Certificate and Indemnity shall be unconditionally guaranteed under a Guaranty (defined in Section 1.4(b) of this Agreement), executed by Lorig Associates, L.L.C. and Bruce Lorig (collectively, the "Guarantor") and delivered to the City as a material inducement to the City's agreement to make the Loan in accordance with this Agreement.

 F. The portion of principal on the City Note that is scheduled to become due and payable in any year, equal to that portion of principal on the Obligor Note scheduled to become due in the same year, is referred to as the "Corresponding Advance" to such portion of principal on the Obligor Note, and the aggregate of all Corresponding Advances is referred to as the "Corresponding Portion" of the City Note.

 G. The City will transfer funds in the maximum aggregate amount of Four Hundred Sixty-Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-One Dollars ($467,871), derived solely from a Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant from HUD, to the Custodian, for deposit into a reserve account (the "BEDI Grant Reserve Account") to be established by the Custodian at Closing. A portion of the BEDI Grant Reserve Account in the amount of One Hundred Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($103,600) shall be held as loan loss reserves ("Loan Loss Reserve"). The remaining portion of the BEDI Grant Reserve Account in the amount of Three Hundred Sixty-Four Thousand Two Hundred Seventy-One Dollars ($364,271) shall be held for interest subsidy as described in Section 4.6(c) below.

 NOTICE: ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the covenants, conditions, representations and warranties contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I - THE LOAN

 1.1 The Loan. In reliance upon Obligor's representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the HUD Contract, the Letter Agreements and the Custodial Agreement, the City hereby agrees to cause funds to be advanced to Obligor through the Custodian (which advances collectively shall constitute the "Loan") in a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to Four Million One Hundred Forty- Four Thousand Dollars ($4,144,000), solely for the purposes set forth in Section 1.2 below. Loan disbursements shall be made only to the extent of available funds received by the Custodian for such purposes through issuance by the City of the City Note, and except with respect to the payment of interest from BEDI Grant funds allocated for such purpose as more particularly described in Section 4.6(b) of this Agreement and the Custodial Agreement, the City shall have no obligation to make disbursements to or for the benefit of Obligor for development of the Property, payment of costs of the Project or otherwise, from any other source. Obligor shall have the right to receive Loan funds only pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Act.

 1.2 Purpose of Loan. Loan proceeds shall be used by Obligor solely for the costs of developing the Facility in accordance with this Agreement.

 1.3 Loan Documentation; Payment of Principal and Interest.

 (a) Loan Documentation. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by the Obligor Note, and together with Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, shall be secured by the Deed of Trust.

 (b) Principal and Interest. The principal of and interest on this Loan shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms set forth in the Obligor Note.

 1.4 Security.

 (a) Deed of Trust. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents at all times shall be secured by the Deed of Trust, which shall be a lien on the Property, and security interest in all personal property associated with the Property, subject only to encumbrances permitted in accordance with Sections 2.4 and 7.16 below, and subject to any other encumbrances, modifications, partial releases or substitutions of security that the OED Director may authorize in writing, in the discretion of the OED Director. The liens and security interests granted pursuant to the Deed of Trust shall be perfected, to the extent possible, by recording in the real property records of King County, Washington, and by filing with the Department of Licensing of the State of Washington, and Obligor agrees to take all action reasonably requested by the City or Custodian, and to pay all fees and costs reasonably required to continue such perfection so long as the Loan or any of Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents remain outstanding. The Deed of Trust shall include an assignment of leases and rents; however, upon request by the City, the Obligor agrees to obtain, execute and deliver such additional assignments of leases, and consents to assignment and subordination and attornment agreements from tenants of the Property as the City may reasonably request prior or subsequent to Closing. Provided that the Obligor is in full compliance with the terms hereof, the terms of any lease for a portion of Building 1 are acceptable to the City, and the tenant executes and delivers a Job Creation Agreement acceptable to the City in compliance with Section 5.7(a) hereof, the City shall agree, as part of a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement in form acceptable to the City, not to terminate the tenancy of such tenant or disturb its possession in case of foreclosure of the Deed of Trust so long as the tenant complies with its obligations under its lease and job creation agreement. Obligor understands and agrees that City may assign the Deed of Trust to HUD as security for HUD's rights in connection with its guarantee of all notes of the City that are subject to the HUD Contract.

 (b) Unconditional Guaranty. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents and the Certificate and Indemnity, at all times shall be secured by an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Guaranty") from the Guarantor, in form and content acceptable to the City.

 (c) Reserve Accounts. Obligor's obligations under the Loan Documents also shall be secured by all funds and investments in all of the accounts now or hereafter established under the Loan Documents, including without limitation, the Custodial Agreement, relating to the Obligor and specifically including without limitation, the respective subaccounts related to the Obligor Note in the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account, the Guaranteed Loan Funds Investment Account, the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account, and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account (all such accounts are collectively referred to herein as the "Reserve Accounts," and to the extent that the Custodian maintains any account for the purpose of more than one loan, all references to any such account, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, shall refer to the subaccount thereof related to the Obligor Note). Obligor hereby pledges to the City, and grants the City a security interest in, all right, title and interest of Obligor, if any, in and to the funds and investments now or hereafter in the Reserve Accounts, and all earnings thereon and proceeds thereof. Obligor agrees that such funds and other assets shall constitute "cash collateral" as described in the United States Bankruptcy Code. Obligor shall promptly take such actions as shall be reasonably requested by the City or Custodian, and pay all fees and costs reasonably required in order to perfect and continue perfection as a first priority lien and security interest, so long as the Loan remains outstanding, the City's security interest in such accounts, the funds and investments therein, and the proceeds thereof.

 (d) Recourse Loan. The Loan shall be made with full recourse to the Obligor and the corporate assets of Obligor.

 (e) Proceeds of Transfers. Upon any transfer of any interest in the Property permitted by the City pursuant to this Loan Agreement, the City shall have a security interest in all proceeds, rents, receivables, notes, and security for any of the foregoing, resulting from such transfer, and/or resulting from any use of proceeds, and Obligor shall execute and deliver promptly to the City all documents requested by the City in order to establish, continue, perfect, or protect such security interests.

 4.6 Loan Repayment Account.

 (a) Monthly Deposits. Commencing in the first month disbursement of principal of the City Note in respect of the Obligor Note is to be made, Obligor shall make monthly installment payments to the Custodian for deposit in an account maintained by the Custodian for the accumulation of funds for payments on the Obligor Note (the "Loan Repayment Account," established under the Custodial Agreement and Letter Agreements), in order that the Custodian shall have sufficient funds to pay installments on the Obligor Note as they come due (each such due date being an "Obligor Note Payment Date"). Obligor shall pay to the Custodian on each Deposit Day, the Interest Component and the Principal Component, each for deposit into the Loan Repayment Account. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account shall be used to make payments on the City Note as they come due. Each such monthly deposit shall be due and payable, in immediately available funds, on the "Deposit Day," which shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of the month, or if such day is not a Business Day, then on the previous Business Day; subject to adjustment in respect of any Conversion Date. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.6(b) hereof, the Interest Component payable each month shall be in an amount equal to the interest accrued and to accrue on the Obligor Note during that entire calendar month, except that the Interest Component shall be adjusted ratably in any month the Loan is not outstanding for the entire month. Each Principal Component shall be one-twelfth (1/12th) of the total principal coming due on the Obligor Note on the next Obligor Note Payment Date on which principal shall become due, except that the Principal Component on each Deposit Day during the period from the date hereof to the first such Obligor Note Payment Date shall be the principal amount then falling due divided by the number of Deposit Days scheduled to occur during such period. Except as provided in Section 4.6(b) below, Obligor shall not be entitled to any reductions in, or credits against, deposits to the Loan Repayment Account based upon interest or earnings credited to the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account or the BEDI Grant Reserve Account. The Obligor hereby irrevocably assigns all of its right, title and interest, if any, in funds deposited in the subaccounts of the Loan Repayment Account, Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account related to the Obligor Note, to the Custodian and the City, and shall have no residual interest in any portion of such Reserves. Obligor shall have no interest in the Loan Loss Reserve.

 (b) Interest Subsidy. The City agrees that funds in the amount of Three Hundred Sixty-Four Thousand Two Hundred Seventy-One Dollars ($364,271), derived solely from a BEDI Grant, shall be used to pay interest first coming due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. Each such payment of interest shall constitute a grant to the Obligor, and shall be credited against interest on the Obligor Note, when the funds are applied to payment on the City Note under Section 4.6(c). Obligor shall not be required to deposit an Interest Component until the month before the month in which the cumulative interest accruing on the Corresponding Portion shall exceed the amount set forth above in this subsection (b).

 (c) Transfers Authorized; Crediting Payments on Obligor Note. The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to transfer from the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the Loan Repayment Account on each Obligor Note Payment Date, funds in the full amount due on the Obligor Note on each such date, and so long as no Interest Component is required from the Obligor, to transfer from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, the amount of the Interest Component that would be required from the Obligor but for the terms of Section 4.6(b). The Custodian is then authorized and directed to apply funds in the Loan Repayment Account to the timely payment of amounts due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Obligor further agrees that upon direction of the City, the Custodian may apply funds in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to make any payments on the Corresponding Portion for which there are insufficient funds in the Loan Repayment Account as a result of failure by Obligor to pay funds to the Custodian for deposit therein as required hereunder, but no application of any funds in any account to payments on the City Note shall waive or reduce any such required payments from Obligor. Obligor's monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account shall not constitute payments under the Obligor Note. Obligor shall be credited with the payment of interest and principal on the Obligor Note only when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit and/or transferred to the Loan Repayment Account under this Section 4.6(c), not including any amounts in the Loan Loss Reserve, are applied to the payment of the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Custodian is further irrevocably authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments in the Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account, in the Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any loss on any such liquidation, for the purposes described in this Section 4.6(c). The authorization by Obligor in this Section 4.6(c) is in addition to, and not in limitation of, the authorization in Section 1.4 above.

 (d) Investment of Funds; Earnings Remain on Deposit. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall be invested at the direction of City, but only in instruments that mature (or are redeemable without penalty) within six (6) months and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days before the next Obligor Note Payment Date, and that are guaranteed as to payment of principal by the United States Government, or in money market funds that invest solely in such instruments. All earnings in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall remain therein until applied in accordance with this Agreement, or until all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, or in the case of the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, until any earlier date when any right of the Obligor to have amounts in such Account applied for its benefit shall have terminated hereunder. When all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, then the remaining balance shall be disbursed to or upon the order of the City.

 (e) Late Charge. If any deposit required to be made into the Loan Repayment Account is not received within ten (10) days after the date when such deposit is due, in addition to additional interest required to be paid in accordance with the Obligor Note, Obligor agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5.0%) of the amount past due, as compensation to the City and Custodian for the staff time and resources required to handle such delinquencies, and not as a penalty. Such late charges shall not be credited to the Loan Repayment Account, but shall be retained by the City and/or Custodian. Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.

 4.7 Application of Payments. Any amounts to be applied to the Obligor Note in accordance with this Agreement shall be applied first to accrued interest on the Obligor Note, next to any premium then due, and the balance, if any, to reduction of principal.

 5.7 Federal Regulations. Obligor acknowledges that the Loan is to be made with funds received by the Custodian under the Section 108 program of the Act and that such funds are subject to CDBG program regulations of HUD, and certain other federal laws and regulations. Accordingly, Obligor agrees, represents and warrants that Obligor shall comply with all applicable requirements under HUD regulations for the CDBG program and under other laws and regulations applicable to loans of such federal funds, including without limitation those cited in this Section 5.7, and shall comply with all of the provisions below, some of which extend beyond federal requirements:

 (a) Benefit to Low- and Moderate Income Individuals. Obligor's Project shall benefit low- and moderate-income persons as defined by HUD in 24 CFR Section 570.3 ("LMIs") to the maximum extent feasible. Development of the Facility and the 60-65,000 square foot movie theater in the Project shall result in the creation of at least one hundred ninety (190) new permanent jobs (full-time equivalent), of which at least fifty-one percent (51%) of such jobs will be held by, or will be available to LMIs, as determined under HUD CDBG regulations. Obligor shall require each initial tenant of Building 1, as a condition to the tenant's use or occupancy of any part of Building 1, to sign a Job Creation Agreement, in a form and content acceptable to the OED Director, under which the tenant will commit to hire LMIs or make jobs available to LMIs, so that the Obligor will be able to ensure and demonstrate, consistent with HUD standards, that at least fifty-one percent (51%) of all of the jobs created in Building 1, on a full-time equivalent basis, are held by, or made available to, LMIs, based on the incomes of the initial job holders or applicants as of the date that Loan funds are provided hereunder. Obligor shall provide reports at such times as the City shall require containing data required by the City on the jobs created and the demographics of persons initially hired and interviewed for such jobs, and shall maintain records sufficient to satisfy HUD requirements for job creation activities, as set forth in 24 CFR Part 570.

 (b) Nondiscrimination. No person shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with CDBG funds. Obligor shall comply fully with all requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq., which provides that no person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; and with Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") regulations implementing such requirements, 24 C.F.R. Part 1.

 Obligor shall comply with all of the requirements and prohibitions of 24 C.F.R. Section 570.602, implementing the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended; those of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations at 28 C.F.R. Parts 35 and 36 thereunder; those of HUD regulations under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. Section 6101 et seq., at 24 C.F.R. Part 146; and those of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Section 794), and implementing regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 8. Obligor shall include, in any instrument effecting or recording any transfer of its interest in the Property, the covenant required by 24 C.F.R. Section 8.50 with regard to compliance with regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

 Obligor shall ensure compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled "Equal Opportunity", as amended, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, 41 C.F.R. Part 60, which provide that no person shall be discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in all phases of employment during the performance of federal contracts and subcontracts, and Obligor shall take affirmative action to ensure fair treatment in employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation and selection for training or apprenticeship. The "equal opportunity clause" set forth in 41 C.F.R. Section 60-1.4(a) is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth, with Obligor as "Contractor" thereunder. Obligor shall cause the appropriate "equal opportunity clause" to be set forth in each "federally assisted construction contract" (as defined in 41 CFR Section 60-1.3, including subcontracts) for the Project, except as expressly exempted under 41 C.F.R. Part 60.

 No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

 (c) Conflict of Interest. Obligor shall ensure compliance with the provisions of 24 CFR Section 570.611, which provide generally that no officer, agent, employee, consultant or elected or appointed official of The City of Seattle, or of a designated public agency, or of any subrecipient receiving CDBG funds, who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted by CDBG funds or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with respect to these activities, shall obtain any financial interest or benefit from, or have any financial interest in, the activity funded under this Loan Agreement or any contract or subcontract or agreement with respect thereto or the proceeds thereof, for himself or herself or those with whom he or she has business or immediate family ties; nor shall (s)he for one year after completion of his or her tenure with the City or such subrecipient obtain or have any such financial interest or benefit. Obligor shall incorporate in all such contracts or subcontracts a provision prohibiting any conflict of interest prohibited by this subsection.

 (d) Debarred Contractors. No portion of the Loan shall be used directly or indirectly to employ, award contracts to, or otherwise engage the services of, or fund, any contractor or subrecipient during any period of debarment, suspension, or placement in ineligibility status of such contractor or subrecipient under the provisions of 24 C.F.R. Part 24. Obligor represents and warrants that neither Obligor nor its principals is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in federal assistance programs under such regulations or Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension." Obligor shall obtain, and shall require contractors and subcontractors to obtain, the certification required by appendix B of

 24 CFR part 24 from each prospective contractor or subcontractor on the Project.

 (e) Lobbying. Obligor hereby certifies and agrees as follows, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Section 1352, to the best of its knowledge and belief:

 (1) No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of Obligor, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement;

 (2) If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with this Federal loan, it will complete and submit Standard Form-LLL, "Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying," in accordance with its instructions; and

 (3) It will require that the language of this Section be included in the award documents for subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly.

 This certification is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was made or entered into. Submission of this certification is made a prerequisite for making or entering into this transaction by section 1352, title 31, U. S. Code. Any person who fails to file the required certification shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

 (f) Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Obligor shall comply with any and all applicable requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and related acts. These requirements include, but are not limited to: language within each contract for construction work; payment of prevailing wages and fringe benefits; the submittal of various documents as evidence of compliance; withholding of funds; equal employment opportunity; and work hours.

 The requirements are defined in the: Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 276(a) et seq.; Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 328 et seq.; Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback Act), 18 U.S.C. Section 874; the Fair Labor Standards Act, and regulations under such Acts, including 29 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 5. If under other applicable law or any other agreement with respect to the Project, minimum levels of wages or benefits are required, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with such levels, and if both Davis-Bacon Act requirements and any other such requirements shall apply, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with higher of the applicable levels.

 (g) Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons. Obligor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with any and all applicable provisions of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u, the purpose of which is to ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. Obligor shall comply, and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable provisions of regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Secretary of HUD and set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 135, and with all applicable rules and orders of HUD issued thereunder.

 (h) Relocation and Acquisition. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that no residential tenants have been or will be displaced in connection with the Project and the Obligor has taken and shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) in connection with the Project. If the Obligor or its affiliate has acquired or entered into an agreement to acquire real property for the Project, then Obligor represents and warrants that prior to making an offer for such property, (1) Obligor or such affiliate clearly advised the owner in writing that it lacked the power of eminent domain and therefore was unable to acquire the property in the event negotiations failed to reach an amicable agreement, and (2) it informed the owner in writing of what Obligor or such affiliate believed to be the fair market value of the property. Obligor represents and warrants that Obligor has provided to City a complete and accurate list of all occupants of the Property as of the date that Obligor obtained site control, and Obligor shall provide a complete and accurate list of all persons occupying the Property at any time after site control and through the date of full occupancy after Project completion. Obligor shall comply fully, at Obligor's sole expense, with the City's Residential Anti-displacement and Relocation Assistance Plan ("RARAP"). If the Project involves the temporary and/or permanent displacement of persons, Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that Obligor has provided and shall provide, at a minimum, all relocation assistance required by 24 CFR Section 42; the federal Uniform Relocation Act and regulations thereunder, 49 CFR Part 24; 24 CFR Section 570.606 and any other applicable federal laws or regulations, and shall maintain complete and accurate records demonstrating such compliance. Obligor agrees that any determination by City of the amount of relocation assistance due to any person shall be final and binding upon Obligor, unless a different determination is made by HUD at the request of such person, in which case the HUD determination shall be final and binding on Obligor. Obligor agrees that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any payment by the City for such person shall, at City's option, constitute an advance on the Loan, without any requirement for a draw request by, or consent of, Obligor. If, as a result of any such direct payments, the amount advanced by City shall exceed the maximum Loan amount stated herein, then the excess shall be immediately due and payable by Obligor to City, at City's demand. Obligor represents and warrants that, except as expressly stated in a relocation plan submitted by Obligor to City in connection with this Loan, no residential tenants have been required to vacate or will be required to vacate the Property permanently because of the Project. Obligor shall carry out the terms of any relocation plan approved by City, but the terms of any such plan shall not limit Obligor's obligations under this Loan Agreement or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.

 (i) Architectural Barriers. Obligor shall ensure that the Property, upon completion of the Project, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (see 42 U.S.C. Sections 4151-57), and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).

 (j) Flood Insurance Protection. If the Property is in a special flood hazard area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, then Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that flood insurance is and shall remain in effect, at Obligor's expense, in accordance with Section 102(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001), so long as any amount is outstanding on the Obligor Note.

 (k) Records. Obligor shall maintain and make available to the City and HUD all records reasonably required to demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of this Agreement, for at least four (4) years after full repayment of the Loan.

 (l) Disclosures. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that it has provided to the City any and all disclosures required by the HUD Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3545, and regulations thereunder, 24 CFR Part 4; that it will provide timely updated disclosures to OH to the extent required by such act and regulations; and that all such disclosures are and shall be complete and accurate.

 (m) Prior Actions. Obligor represents and warrants that in all actions related to the Project to date Obligor and each of its affiliates involved in the acquisition of the property, each has complied with all requirements referred to in this Section 5.7.

 (n) Indemnity. Obligor shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand resulting from Obligor's failure to comply with any federal requirement to be complied with pursuant to this Agreement or failure to maintain adequate records to demonstrate such compliance. This provision shall survive expiration of this Agreement.

 5.8 Reports. Obligor shall deliver to the City reports and information as City may require for purposes of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Obligor, which may include copies of tenant certifications, rent rolls, leases, property management agreements and any other contracts affecting the Property.

 5.9 Liens or Claims of Liens. Obligor shall keep the Property free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, superior or inferior to the Deed of Trust, except for those permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 above and any of the following:

 (a) Liens for property taxes on the Property not yet due and payable;

 (b) The rights of tenants as tenants only under leases entered into in the ordinary course of Obligor's operation of the Property and in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but only to the extent that such leases are subordinate to the lien of the Deed of Trust, to the Leases (as defined herein), and to any other material leases, which subordinate status shall be insured by endorsement to the City's title insurance policy, at Obligor's expense, within thirty (30) days of request to Obligor by the City; and

 (c) Liens subordinate to the lien of the Deed of Trust, created after the date of Closing with the prior written consent of the OED Director, in his or her discretion.

 If any claims of lien shall be asserted against the Property other

 than as permitted by this Section, Obligor, regardless of any action that City may otherwise be authorized to take, shall obtain a release and satisfaction of such lien claim, bond the lien claim, procure title insurance satisfactory to City protecting City from any loss relating to such lien claim, or otherwise provide to City assurances and security satisfactory to City that the lien claim will be paid or satisfied not later than ten (10) days after a judgment on the lien claim. Provided Obligor complies with the previous sentence, Obligor may in good faith contest any worker's or material supplier's lien in legal proceedings that will prevent enforcement of the lien claim and prevent foreclosure of the Property. If such a lien claim is not released or satisfied or a bond or other security satisfactory to City provided within forty-five (45) days of written request from City to Obligor, then the failure to do so shall allow the City to declare an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6.1 below) regardless of whether such lien claim is or is not superior to the Deed of Trust.

 Nothing in this Section shall be construed to imply that property of a public corporation may be subject to a statutory mechanic's or materialmen's lien or other involuntary lien, nor be construed as consent by Obligor or the City to any such lien.

 5.10 Political Activity. No portion of the Loan shall be used for any political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 5.11 Further Actions. Obligor will at any time and from time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents, opinions, or other instruments or obtain such additional insurance as City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or county regulatory agency.

 5.12 Other Agreements. Obligor shall fully comply in a timely manner with all other agreements for the financing of the Project, including without limitation construction loans, bridge loans, and equity investment contracts ("Other Agreements"), but nothing in this Section shall be construed to waive, or excuse noncompliance with, and provisions of this Agreement or any applicable City ordinances or permits. Obligor shall timely satisfy all conditions under any Other Agreements to the receipt of funding for the Project and for the conversion of construction or temporary financing to a term loan.

 5.13 Payment of Compensation of Custodian. Obligor shall be

 responsible for and pay its prorata portion of the fees of the Custodian as provided under the Custodial Agreement. The Custodian's acceptance fee, prorated first annual fee and counsel fees and expenses shall be disbursed to Custodian from the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account at the time of initial Loan disbursement. Thereafter, Obligor shall promptly pay the Custodian's fees and expenses directly to the Custodian.

 5.14 Payment of Other Indebtedness. Obligor shall timely pay the principal, interest and all other amounts due on any other indebtedness or liability now or hereafter owing by the Obligor to any person and secured by the Property; provided, that nothing in this Section shall authorize Obligor to make any payment from any funds or assets pledged to the City hereunder.

 5.15 Transfer of Property. Obligor shall not cause or permit any transfer of the Property or any interest of Obligor therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent of the City, except for the creation of liens, encumbrances or leases that are expressly permitted under the Loan Documents without the City's consent.

 ARTICLE VI - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 6.1 Events of Default. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events and prior to the complete cure thereof by Obligor in a manner satisfactory to the City, the City shall have the right to declare an Event of Default hereunder, without notice or demand by City, except as expressly provided in this Section:

 (a) Any failure to pay when due any deposit into the Loan Repayment Account in respect of principal or interest on the Obligor Note;

 (c) Any transfer of the Property or any interest therein, voluntary or involuntary, contrary to Section 5.15 of this Loan Agreement;

 (d) Any failure to comply with the terms of Section 5.9 of this Loan Agreement (relating to lien claims) within the time period permitted by such Section;

 (e) Any breach or nonperformance by Obligor of any provision of any of the Loan Documents not included within any of Subsections (a)- (d) above that is not cured within sixty (60) days after notice to Obligor of such breach or nonperformance, or such longer cure period as may be permitted under the specific terms of the Loan Document; provided, however, that unless HUD shall otherwise require, if (1) such breach or nonperformance is susceptible to cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such cure period, (2) Obligor shall commence to cure such breach or nonperformance within such cure period and shall thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceed to cure the same, and (3) Obligor shall inform the City in writing of the status of the cure at the expiration of such cure period and every thirty days thereafter, then such cure period may be extended in the sole discretion of the OED Director for such time as the OED Director determines is reasonably necessary for Obligor in the exercise of due diligence to cure such breach or nonperformance;

 (f) A petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or for a receiver or trustee for any of Obligor's property is filed by Obligor, or is filed against Obligor and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or if Obligor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or any attachment or execution is levied against a substantial portion of the property of Obligor and is not discharged within ninety (90) days, or if any law or court order shall require the City, Custodian or any other party to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount paid under the Obligor Note or this Agreement as a preference or for any other reason except refund of duplicative payment;

 (g) Any representation, warranty or disclosure made to City by Obligor, or contained in any information submitted by Obligor to City or to any government agency in connection with the Loan or the Property, proves to be materially false or misleading as of the date when made or reaffirmed, whether or not such representation or disclosure appears in this Agreement;

 (h) Any default by Obligor of its obligations under the Certificate and Indemnity, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure provisions thereunder;

 (i) Any default under the Guaranty.

 6.2 Declaration of Event of Default. City's declaration of an Event of Default hereunder shall be made by notice to Obligor pursuant to Section 7.15 of this Agreement and shall be effective as provided therein.

 6.3 Remedies.

 (a) Upon declaring an Event of Default, City may, in addition to any other remedies which City may have hereunder or under the Loan Documents or by law, at its option and without prior demand or notice take any or all of the following actions:

 (1) Immediately terminate any further advances of Loan funds hereunder and revoke any instructions to any third party holding any such funds;

 (9) Seek judicial appointment of a receiver.

 (b) All remedies of City provided for herein and in any other Loan Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law. The exercise of any right or remedy by City hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default, or prejudice City in the exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless, in the exercise of said rights, City realizes all amounts owed to it under such Loan Documents.

 6.4 No Default Prior to Declaration. No default or Event of Default shall exist under this Agreement or the Obligor Note until the same shall have been declared by the City or other party authorized to make such declaration; provided, that failure to declare, or delay in declaring, a default hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies or excuse any failure by Obligor to strictly comply with its obligations under all of the Loan Documents.

 ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any noncompliance or breach by Obligor hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such noncompliance or breach, and no express waiver shall affect any breach or noncompliance other than as specified in the waiver. Any waiver shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or of, any act by Obligor requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Delegation to Custodian; Changes in Custodian and Custodial Agreement. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of City, HUD, and Obligor, their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder. The terms hereof shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Obligor's interest hereunder cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of City. Obligor acknowledges and agrees that City may assign to HUD or any custodian or trustee for HUD any or all of City's rights under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents and may direct that any payment or performance be provided directly to HUD or such custodian or trustee, whether or not the Obligor Note or this Agreement have been assigned. Obligor agrees that City may delegate to the Custodian the right to make demands and give directions on behalf of City under the Loan Documents, but that the scope of any such delegation shall be strictly limited to the terms of a written instrument duly signed on behalf of the City. Obligor further acknowledges that the Custodial Agreement may be modified or terminated, or a substitute Custodial Agreement executed, or a successor Custodian appointed, in each case without the consent of Obligor so long as the obligations of Obligor are not increased and the rights of the Obligor under the Loan Documents are not adversely affected in any material respect. Except for minor modifications to the Custodial Agreement not affecting Obligor, City agrees to give reasonable advance notice to the Obligor of any action as described in the preceding sentence, and agrees in each case to provide a copy of any modification or substitute Custodial Agreement to Obligor within fifteen (15) days after the execution thereof.

 7.3 No Defense Based on City Regulatory Actions. Obligor understands that (a) the operations of Obligor in the Property and elsewhere are subject to numerous laws, regulations, ordinances and permits, including those of City and other governmental bodies relating to land use, environmental hazards, and other regulatory matters, and (b) the modification, interpretation, application, or revocation of such laws, regulations, rules or permits could adversely affect economic return to Obligor from the Property. Obligor has conducted its own investigation and relied on the advice of its own counsel and experts as to all such matters in connection with Obligor's acquisition of the Property. Obligor acknowledges that by entering into this Agreement the City does not make, and that the City expressly disclaims, any representation or assurance whatever as to (1) the present or future status of the Property or the uses thereof under applicable laws or regulations, including those of the City; or (2) the availability, issuance or continuation of any permits, approvals, or interpretations of any kind that may be required or desired by Obligor or any other party in connection with the Property. Obligor agrees that notwithstanding any regulatory action or omission of City affecting Obligor or affecting the use or development of the Property (whether or not such action or omission shall be determined to be consistent with applicable law in any proceeding), no defense, offset or reduction of liability shall be available to Obligor, at law or in equity.

 7.4 Time. Time is of the essence of all provisions of the Loan Documents.

 Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, the OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under

 this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED.

 7.16 Additional Terms and Conditions

 The terms of this Section are intended to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the terms and conditions set forth above, but in case of any irreconcilable conflict, the terms of this Section shall control. The inability of Obligor to satisfy any condition below for any reason shall not excuse any failure to comply in a timely manner with any other provision hereof. All provisions and conditions in this Section, and all other conditions to disbursement set forth in this Agreement, are for the benefit only of the City (and where applicable, HUD) and may be waived in whole or in part by the OED Director in his or her discretion, but no waiver shall be valid unless in writing signed by the OED Director.

 (a) Commitment. Obligor represents and warrants that _________________("Construction Lender") has committed to providing construction financing for the Project ("Construction Loan"), and that as a condition to providing such financing, ________________ requires that Obligor deposit the entire amount of the Loan (net of deductions authorized hereunder) in an account controlled by Construction Lender ("Loan Proceeds Account"). Obligor shall ensure that Construction Lender shall disburse funds from the Loan Proceeds Account solely to pay for construction costs, and any other development costs approved by OED, that are eligible for Loan funds.

 (b) Notices to the City; Construction Draw Documentation. At least ten (10) days prior to each disbursement made by Construction Lender, Obligor shall provide documentation satisfactory to OED that Obligor has complied with conditions to disbursement from the Loan Proceeds Account, as such conditions have been approved by the City, for eligible costs of the Facility not otherwise funded or to be funded, and shall supply all documentation required by OED to support such costs (including, in the case of payments to contractors, vendors, consultants or service providers, copies of contracts complying with this agreement and invoices acceptable to OED).

 (c) Approved Budget. Loan funds shall be used for commercial development costs as described in Attachment D attached hereto and made a part hereof, with no adjustments except as approved by OED.

 (d) Permanent Loan. No later than __________ months after the Closing of this Loan ("Permanent Loan Funding Date"), the Obligor shall cause the Construction Loan to be repaid in full, and for such purpose may grant a new first lien deed of trust on the Property to _______________ ("Permanent Lender") securing a loan in the amount of no more than $19,000,000 ("Permanent Loan"), with a term loan of no less than _____ (___) years, and with payments based on an amortization of at least thirty (30) years, and otherwise on commercially reasonable terms. The City, upon request of Obligor and reasonable opportunity to review all relevant documents, shall execute and deliver a subordination agreement for such new deed of trust on terms substantially equivalent to the subordination terms for the Construction Loan, provided that the Obligor shall cause any other monetary lien with priority over the City's Deed of Trust to be fully released or reconveyed of record so that the City's Deed of Trust is a second lien on the Property and on the landlord's interest in all Leases, and provided that if so required by the City the Obligor shall cause endorsements to the City's policy of title insurance, satisfactory to the OED Director, to be issued at the Obligor's sole expense, insuring such priority.

 (e) Collateral Assignment. No later than the Closing date of this Loan, and as a condition to disbursement of Loan proceeds, the Obligor shall have executed and delivered to the City a Collateral

 Assignment of Interest in Accounts ("Collateral Assignment"), in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director, assigning and pledging to the City, among other things, the Obligor's interest in the Loan Proceeds Account and one or more additional bank accounts of Obligor in the additional cumulative amount of no less than $130,000 (such additional amount, as it may be increased hereunder, is the "Cash Collateral"), as security for the Loan, which shall be maintained until the Obligor shall have achieved stabilized operating income of the Property. The City shall have a first priority perfected security interest in the Cash Collateral. Obligor shall be deemed to have achieved stabilized operating income only when the Obligor has obtained the Permanent Loan and has achieved a 1.2 debt service coverage ratio, i.e., has received over the previous 12 months, net operating income from the Property, determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("NOI") in an amount of at least 1.2 times the sum of the actual debt service payable in that period on the Loan, plus the maximum annual debt service on the Permanent Loan (such sum is referred to as "Annual Debt Service"). Until the Obligor achieves stabilized operating income, the amount of the Cash Collateral shall be adjusted on an annual basis as needed to maintain a 1.2 debt service coverage ratio so that the Cash Collateral is no less than the excess of 120% of Annual Debt Service, determined annually beginning ____________, over NOI for the preceding 12 month period. The OED Director shall determine the amount of such annual adjustment following OED's annual review of the Property financial statements.

 (f) Asset Management and Loan Monitoring. Obligor acknowledges that it has reviewed the City's Section 108 loan monitoring and asset management policies under City of Seattle Resolution Number 30872, and agrees to provide information and otherwise comply with the requirements of such policies. Nothing in any such policies shall in any way impair or limit the obligations of the Obligor or others under the Loan Documents or limit any rights or remedies of the City. Furthermore, no later than February 1st of each year of the Loan, Obligor agrees to pay an asset management and loan monitoring fee, in the annual amount of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) until all amounts owing hereunder shall have been paid in full. It is anticipated that the loan monitoring and asset management duties will be performed by a private entity under contract to OED, and Obligor shall make payment directly to such private entity according to instructions provided by OED. Moreover, Obligor acknowledges that loan monitoring costs will increase due to periodic CPI adjustments under the City's contract with the private monitoring entity, and Obligor shall increase the amount of its annual payment according to such national CPI adjustments.

 (g) No later than the Closing date of this Loan, and as a condition to disbursement of Loan proceeds, the Obligor shall have executed and delivered to the City a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with the Seattle Jobs Initiative ("SJI"), in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director. Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, the Obligor shall cooperate with SJI and other workforce development partners in the outreach and recruitment of LMIs for the permanent positions made available by the Project. In addition, the Obligor shall provide access to the training and employment opportunities created by the construction of the Project as identified in the MOU. The obligations of the Obligor under this subsection and the MOU are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the obligations under Section 5.7 above and related HUD regulations.

 (h) Formation of Condominium; Amendment of Deed of Trust and Partial Reconveyance.[to be revised]

 If, on or before the date by which the Project is to be completed hereunder:

 (1) Obligor shall have substantially completed the Project consistent with this Loan Agreement, applicable permits and any recorded agreements, or shall have achieved such progress as shall be acceptable to the OED Director in his or her discretion;

 (2) Obligor shall have formed a condominium that includes the entire property and shall have created condominium units that include the entire Facility [and the residential space in the same buildings] ("Permanent Security Units"), all on terms acceptable to the OED Director in his or her discretion;

 (3) Obligor shall not be in default under any of the terms of the Loan Documents;

 (4) the OED Director shall have determined that the security provided by the Permanent Security Units will be substantially consistent with the underwriting policies as adopted in Seattle Resolution Number 30872;

 (5) [other specific conditions]

 then upon request of Obligor, the City shall execute and deliver a request for partial reconveyance so that the lien of the Deed of Trust shall be removed from the portions of the Property other than the Permanent Security Units, provided that (i) Obligor agrees to such additional provisions in the Deed of Trust, as amended, related to the condominium and the changed nature of the security, as the City shall reasonably require; and (ii) City receives, at Obligor's expense, one or more endorsements to the City's policy of title insurance, insuring that the Deed of Trust is a valid lien on one or more validly created condominium units, subject to no prior monetary liens except the Permanent Loan deed of trust, and with title endorsements covering such other issues related to the condominium declaration and any other matters as the City shall require.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Obligor and City have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above by and through their duly authorized representatives.

 FORM OF OBLIGOR NOTE

 VARIABLE/FIXED RATE PROMISSORY NOTE

 Seattle, Washington $4,144,000

 _________, 2006

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, NORTHGATE SOUTH COMMONS, LLC ("Obligor"), a Washington limited liability company, promises to pay to THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Payee"), a Washington municipal corporation, or order, at the time or times provided herein, in lawful money of the United States, the sum of Four Million One Hundred Forty-Four Thousand Dollars ($4,144,000), with interest as provided herein.

 This Note is given to evidence a loan (the "Loan") made pursuant to the Loan Agreement dated as of _________, 2006 (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), between the Obligor and the Payee. The funds used by the Payee to make the Loan have been obtained by Payee exclusively through the issuance of a note in the maximum commitment amount of $7,484,000 issued by the Payee, a copy of which note, with a schedule of Principal Due Dates as modified by agreement of the City and HUD, is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference (as so modified, and including any note issued in replacement therefor or for a portion thereof that includes the amount disbursed in order to fund the Loan evidenced hereby, the "City Note") pursuant to Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC section5308) and 24 CFR 570.700, et seq., pursuant to which the Payee has entered into certain agreements, including, but not limited to, (a) with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance, as amended ("HUD Contract") which contract incorporates by reference, an Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement between HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), which agreement, as amended or amended from time to time, may be referred to collectively as the "Master Agreement;" (b) with HUD, the BEDI Grant Agreement #B- 99-BD-53-0015 ("BEDI Agreement"); and (c) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement (as it may be amended, the "Custodial Agreement"). The Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is made subject to all of the terms and conditions of the HUD Contract, Master Agreement, BEDI Agreement and the City Note. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the City Note, the Loan Agreement, the Custodial Agreement or the Master Agreement as applicable.

 Each portion of principal outstanding on this Note shall bear interest from the date hereof at the rate applicable to the Corresponding Advance of principal under the City Note. For each installment of principal shown on Exhibit 1 hereto, the Corresponding Advance consists of an equal amount of principal on the City Note maturing in the same year as such installment of principal hereunder.

 Interest on this Note shall be due and payable on the 15th day of each calendar month next preceding each of the following dates if interest on the City Note is scheduled to become due and payable on such date: February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year. The amount of interest payable on this Note on each such 15th day shall include interest accrued through such date and interest to accrue through the end of the month in which the interest payment becomes due under this Note. Interest on this Note also shall be due 15 days before any other date when interest shall become due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, and the amount of interest then payable on this Note shall include interest accrued and to accrue up to such date when interest shall become due on the City Note. Interest on the City Note is due and payable quarterly in arrears prior to the Conversion Date, on the Conversion Date, and semiannually thereafter. Principal on this Note is due and payable as set out on Exhibit 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by

 this reference. Each date upon which principal or interest, or both, is due and payable hereunder is an "Obligor Note Payment Date."

 The principal amount due under this Note on each Obligor Note Payment Date shall be as set forth on the attached Exhibit 1, except to the extent such principal amount shall have been reduced by prepayment before such Obligor Note Payment Date as provided herein.

 On and after the Conversion Date (whether conversion to a fixed rate or rates is effected with the consent of the Obligor or otherwise), as more fully set forth in the City Note, each Corresponding Advance will accrue interest on the City Note at the fixed rate that the underwriters of the City Note, or securities representing participation interests in a pool of notes guaranteed by HUD, including the City Note, determine will enable them to sell the City Note or such participation interests under then prevailing market conditions as of the Conversion Date at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount thereof. Conversion to a fixed rate is subject to limitations set forth in the Loan Agreement.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of any default hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, which default is not cured as permitted by the Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and this Note shall bear interest at the greater of the rate set as provided above or twelve percent (12%) per annum.

 Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest after the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The period of time over which interest is computed in order to determine the amount payable on any Obligor Note Payment Date is referred to as the "Interest Period" for such Obligor Note Payment Date.

 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all principal, interest, fees, costs and other charges that Obligor is obligated to pay in connection with this Note and the Loan shall be due and payable, in full, no later than July 15, 2022.

 This Note, together with other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Deed of Trust"), of even date herewith, from the Obligor for the benefit of the Payee. This Note, together with other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents, are secured by other collateral, including without limitation security interests in the monies and investments held in certain Reserves established in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Master Agreement, and by an assignment of leases and rents.

 The principal hereof and any interest accrued hereon may be prepaid, subject in the case of principal to approval by HUD of prepayment by the Payee of an equal amount of each respective Corresponding Advance on the City Note, and provided, however, that any prepayment shall be applied to the principal installment(s) with latest maturity unless otherwise agreed in writing by the holder hereof and by HUD, and provided, further:

 (a) On or before the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Payee and with, and only with, the consent of HUD. Any prepayment of the principal hereof shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, and partial prepayments shall be credited against the principal amount last becoming due hereunder.

 (b) After the Conversion Date, Obligor shall give 90 days prior written notice of its intention to make any prepayment. Any prepayment shall be applied to the payments last becoming due under this Note. No partial prepayment shall relieve the Obligor of the obligation to make any future payments due after the date of any prepayment. Any prepayment shall be in an amount not less than the amount that is sufficient to defease the Corresponding Advances on the City Note, as provided in the Master Agreement. If in the event of any prepayment, the Payee incurs any costs, expenses, fees, charges, premiums or losses, the Obligor shall pay such items upon demand in addition to the principal and interest due hereunder.

 Any prepayment by Obligor or any third party, or recovery from the disposition of any collateral, after default shall constitute a prepayment and be subject to all terms and conditions regarding prepayment.

 In the event of any default by Obligor in any term or condition of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, which default is not cured as permitted by the applicable document, the entire principal and accrued interest hereunder shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand at the option of the holder of this Note. If the entire balance of principal and interest shall be declared due and payable after the Conversion Date, then the Obligor shall pay to the holder hereof, in addition to all other amounts owing, any further amount required in order that the holder is able to fully defease, solely from the payments by Obligor hereunder and without costs to such holder, all of the outstanding Corresponding Advances under the City Note. Obligor acknowledges that such additional amount, if any, is intended to protect the holder hereof from potential loss resulting from the enforcement of the terms hereof after default, and not as a penalty.

 If Obligor is in default under the provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, and Payee or other holder of this Note commences any action to enforce collection hereof or foreclosure under any security document given in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligor agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Payee, including but not limited to Payee's or such holder's reasonable attorneys' fees.

 Demand, protest, and notice of demand and protest are hereby waived, and the Obligor, to the extent authorized by law hereby waives any and all homestead or other exemption rights which otherwise might apply to the obligation evidenced by this Note, and/or any property covered by any security document given in connection herewith.

 The Obligor executes this Note as a principal and not as a surety.

 ORAL AGREEMENTS, OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LEND MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.
