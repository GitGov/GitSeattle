 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Authorizing Ordinance and Resolution 30638 (the "Note Resolution" and, together with the Authorizing Ordinance, the "Note Legislation"), the City issued its Solid Waste System Revenue Bond Anticipation Note, 2003 (Nonrevolving Line of Credit) (the "Note"), as a short-term subordinate lien obligation of the Solid Waste System, with a maturity date of July 1, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 121779, the City amended the Note Legislation to extend the maturity date of the Note to December 31, 2006; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that it is in the best interest of the City to extend the maturity date of the Note to December 31, 2007, and to increase the authorized principal amount of the Note to an aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $31,800,000, and Bank of America, N.A., as owner of the Note, has agreed to the extension of maturity and increase the aggregate principal amount; NOW, THEREFORE,
