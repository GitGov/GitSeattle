 WHEREAS, the Power Purchase Agreement provides for City Light to schedule the operation of the project on a monthly basis; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Klamath Falls has offered to modify the contract to allow City Light to schedule operation of the project on a daily basis which, together with some other modifications would, on an aggregate basis, allow City Light to derive more value from the Agreement; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Delete Article 4.5.3 in its entirety.

 8. Daily Schedules. Delete Article 6.2 (Monthly Schedules) in its entirety and replace it with the following:

 "6.2 Daily Schedules.

 6.2.1 Power Purchaser's Daily Schedule. Power Purchaser may pre- schedule under this Agreement (as set forth in this Article 6.2) at the Contract Delivery Rate for all On-Peak hours and/or all Off-Peak hours. No later than 06:30 PPT on each Prescheduling Day, Power Purchaser shall provide Seller with a schedule or schedules of Power to be delivered to the Power Purchaser under this Agreement for the Day or Days being pre-scheduled. If Power Purchaser has not timely provided such a pre-schedule or pre-schedules to Owner as set forth above, a flat 100-MW schedule shall apply for the Day or Days being pre-scheduled. Except for Force Majeure events and Forced Outages that have not yet occurred, Seller shall notify Power Purchaser at the time of pre-scheduling if Seller is not making capacity available for the Day or Days being pre-scheduled for reasons of declared Force Majeure, Forced Outages, or Scheduled Maintenance Outages. If deliveries are changed by Force Majeure or as otherwise permitted herein, Seller and Power Purchaser shall adjust the pre-schedules to reflect actual deliveries. Such adjusted schedules and pre-schedules not needing to be adjusted shall collectively become final schedules ("Final Schedules") at the end of the active Day. These Final Schedules will be the basis for settlement. The Parties intend that scheduling hereunder shall follow the procedures established by the WECC. Once schedules are established, changes to schedules shall be made only as provided in this Article 6 or as agreed by the Parties. Power Purchaser shall have no rights to make hourly or intra-hourly schedule changes.

 6.2.2. Cycling Costs. For flat 24-hour schedules, a cycling charge of $5400 (100 MW * 24 hours * $2.25/MWh) shall apply on any day in which the schedule increases from the previous day. No cycling charge shall apply on decreases in flat schedules or on flat schedules that are unchanged from the previous day's flat schedule. For example, if Power Purchaser elects a 0-MW flat 24-hour schedule on day one and a 100-MW flat 24-hour schedule on day two, a $5400 cycling charge shall apply to day two. If Power Purchaser then elects a 100-MW flat 24-hour schedule on day three, no cycling charge shall apply on day three. If Power Purchaser then elects a 0-MW flat 24-hour schedule on day four, no cycling charge shall apply on day four.

 On any day that Power Purchaser elects an On Peak-only schedule, a cycling charge of $5600 (100 MW * 16 hours * $3.50/MWh) shall apply on such day."

 15. Exhibit K. Exhibit K (Example of Monthly Invoice Calculation for December, 2001) is hereby revised as follows:
