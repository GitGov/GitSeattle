The site is currently owned by King County and is used as a ~~park and ride~~park-and-ride facility. King County and the City of Seattle have negotiated a purchase and sale agreement, which provides for the sale of the property for $9,262,500.~~are currently negotiating a purchase and sale agreement, which will determine the final purchase price. King County has ordered an appraisal of the property to facilitate negotiations.~~The City and County have also agreed to a related lease agreement, which provides that the County may, on a month-to-month basis, continue to use the property as a park-and-ride facility for up to 30 months. Development of a park on the site will likely not take place until after ~~2008~~ 2007 when King County is expected to relocate its ~~park and ride~~park-and-ride facility to the south end of Northgate Mall.

 Section 6. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

Buyer shall protect, defend and hold Seller harmless from any claims, liabilities, costs or liens that may be filed against Seller or the Property as a result of such due diligence investigation, which indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event will Buyer be liable for, or required to indemnify Seller on account of any preexisting soil, groundwater or other environmental contamination of the Property, or any other physical condition in, on, over, under or concerning the Property.

 In the event Buyer obtains information, which indicates the potential for contamination of the Property by Hazardous Materials, Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require further sampling and analysis of the Property by its environmental consultants.

 4.2 Document Inspection Contingency: Buyer's purchase of the Property is contingent upon Buyer's review and approval in Buyer's sole discretion, of the following documents in Seller's possession or control which Seller agrees to deliver to Buyer within five (5) days following mutual execution of this Agreement (to the extent not previously delivered): any and all surveys of the Property; any environmental reports or studies, including any hazardous or toxic waste assessments; all soils, traffic or other engineering reports; all governmental approvals, permits or licenses; any and all current (within the last 3 years) appraisals of the Property; and all agreements or contracts with any utility providers.

Buyer shall have ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of any Intervening Lien, together with a description thereof and a copy of the instrument creating or evidencing the Intervening Lien, to submit written objections thereto. If Seller does not within five (5) days after receipt of such objections provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that it will remove such Intervening Liens, Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement.

 4.4 Removal of Contingencies: Buyer shall have a period of fifteen (15) days, the Contingency Period, from the date all parties have signed this Agreement to remove or waive the above contingencies (collectively the "Contingencies"), which decision shall be at Buyer's sole discretion.

This Agreement is for the benefit of, and binding upon, Buyer and Seller and their heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. The captions of this Agreement are for convenience and reference only and in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Agreement.

 THIS LEASE ("Agreement") made and entered into this_____ day of ____________, 2006, ("Commencement Date") by and between The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("City"), and King County, a political subdivision of the State of Washington ("County").

 RECITALS

 A. City has on today's date acquired from County the property in King County, Washington, described in Paragraph 1, below.

 B. County has used the property primarily for surface parking for the King County Metro Transit System's "Park and Ride" operations.

 C. City intends to construct a public park on the property. Construction of the park will displace some of the surface parking now serving the Park and Ride needs of the Northgate area. While King County is developing replacement parking, there is a continuing need for Park and Ride parking spaces. To meet this need, the parties have agreed, as a condition of County's sale of the property to City, to allow County to continue to lease the property upon the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement for a period of time not to exceed two and a half years after the sale.

 AGREEMENTS

 NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed between City and County:

 1. Agreement.

 9. Surrender Upon Termination. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, County shall remove County's personal property and equipment and any Alteration not approved by City pursuant to Section 8 (d), and shall surrender the Property to City.

 10. Discharge of Liens. County will not directly or indirectly create or permit to be created or to remain, and will discharge any mortgage, lien, security interest, encumbrance or charge on, pledge of or conditional sale or other title retention agreement with respect to the Property or any part thereof.

 11. Damage or Destruction. In the event of damage to or destruction of any improvements on the Property, County shall, at its option, either (i) repair and restore the improvements so damaged or destroyed to a condition permitting the continued use of the Property as a surface parking lot, or (ii) elect not to so repair and restore such improvements. If County elects not to repair and restore such improvements, County shall remove any such damaged improvements or take such actions with respect to such damaged improvements as are necessary to avoid any danger to the safety of persons coming on to the Property.

 12. Insurance.

 limit of liability of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) each occurrence. Promptly upon City's request, County shall provide to City a copy of the insurance policy or a self-insurance letter evidencing such coverage. Such liability policy or self-insurance program shall not be materially changed or cancelled with respect to City except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice from County to City.

 13. Inspection of Premises. City and City's agents and representatives shall be entitled, from time to time, upon reasonable notice to County, to go upon the Property during normal business hours for the purpose of inspecting the Property or the performance by County of the agreements and conditions of this Agreement.

 14. Indemnity. Each party shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the other party, its officers, officials, employees and agents while acting within the scope of their employment as such, from any and all suits, costs, claims, actions, losses, penalties, judgments, and/or awards of damages, of whatsoever kind arising out of, or in connection with, or incident to this Lease Agreement caused by or resulting from each party's own negligent acts or omissions, violations of law or breaches of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it is fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its own subcontractors, their employees and agents, acting within the scope of their employment as such, as it is for the acts and omissions of its own employees and agents. Each party agrees that its obligations under this provision extend to any claim, demand, and/or cause of action brought by or on behalf of any of its employees, or agents. The foregoing indemnity is specifically and expressly intended to constitute a waiver of each party's immunity under Washington's Industrial Insurance act, RCW Title 51, as respects the other party only, and only to the extent necessary to provide the indemnified party with a full and complete indemnity of claims made by the indemnitor's employees. The parties acknowledge that these provisions were specifically negotiated and agreed upon by them.

 15. Assignment and Subletting. County may not assign this Agreement, or any interest therein, nor sublet the Property or any portion thereof, without City's prior written consent.

 16. Event of Default. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:

 16.1. Payments to City. Failure of County to duly and punctually make any payment owing to City hereunder, or to pay any Imposition or any other payment which if not paid may result in a lien on the Property as and when the same becomes due and payable, or the failure to maintain any of the insurance coverage required hereunder or pay any of the premiums required to be paid with respect thereto, and such occurrence or failure continues for a period of ten (10) business days after notice thereof given to County by City.

 16.2 Other Covenants. County being in breach of, or County failing to perform, comply with, or observe any other term, covenant, warranty, condition, agreement or undertaking contained in or arising under this Agreement other than those referred to in Section 16.1 and such occurrence or failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days after notice thereof is given to County.

 17. Termination of Agreement. In addition to all other rights and remedies available to City by law or equity, City may, at any time after the occurrence of any Event of Default, and while the same remains unremedied, give notice to County of its intention to terminate this Agreement, in which case, unless within ten (10) business days after the giving of such notice, the condition giving rise to the notice of default is cured, this Agreement shall terminate and City may reenter upon the Property and have possession of it. However, if the Event of Default is one described in Section 16.2 and is one which can be cured, but cannot with due diligence (without regard to the availability of funds or the financial condition of County) be cured within ten (10) business days, and County proceeds promptly and prosecutes with all due diligence the curing of such default, then the time for curing of such Event of Default shall be extended for such period as may be necessary to complete the same with all due diligence.

 18. Damages and Remedies. City's exercise of any remedy arising by virtue of an Event of Default are not exclusive, and City may exercise any and all other rights or remedies provided by this Agreement or by law or equity. A termination under Section 17 shall not extinguish the right of either party to collect damages arising from the breach of this Agreement by the other party.

 19. No Waivers. No failure by either party hereto to insist upon the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right, power or remedy consequent to any breach thereof, and no waiver of any such breach, or the acceptance of full or partial rent during the continuance thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any such provision. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, or the rights of any party hereto with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach.

 20. Payment by City of County's Defaulted Payments. In case of default on the part of County to pay any money, or do any act to satisfy any of the obligations or covenants which it is required to pay, do, or satisfy under the provisions of this Agreement, City may, at its option, after notice to County, pay any or all such sums, or do any or all such acts which require the payment of money, or incur any expense whatsoever to remedy the failure of County to perform any one or more of the covenants herein contained. When such payment or satisfaction is to a third party, City shall obtain a full release and waiver from the third party releasing any waiving any and all claims the third party may have against the County. County shall repay the same to City on demand together with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, such interest to be calculated from the date payment is made by City.

 21. No Partnership. Nothing contained herein or in any instrument relating hereto shall be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture between City and County or between City and any other party, or cause City to be responsible in any way for debts or obligations of County or any other party. All revenues generated by County's parking operations on the Property shall belong solely to County.

 22. Time of the Essence. Time is hereby expressly declared to be of the essence of this Agreement and of each and every term, covenant, agreement, condition and provision hereof.

 25. Agreement Construed as a Whole. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall in all cases be construed as a whole according to its fair meaning and neither strictly for nor against City or County.

 26. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this Agreement shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 27. Effect of Assignment. The term "City" means the person who from time to time holds all of the original City's right, title and interest in and to the Property. City shall have the right to freely assign or, otherwise transfer such right, title and interest and upon notice of such transfer given by the City to County, City shall be entirely freed and relieved of all future covenants and obligations of City hereunder except to the extent that the transfer is for purposes of security only; provided that the release shall be effective only upon the assignee or transferee having expressly assumed, by duly recorded documents, all obligations of City hereunder.

 28. Survival.

 Northgate Urban Center Park - Acquisition

 Project ID: K732287

 Location: NE 112th

 Neighborhood Plan: Northgate Neighborhood Plan Matrix: I.G. 12.6

 Neighborhood District: North Urban Northgate

 This project covers the debt issuance for the acquisition of a 3.73- acre site on the north end of the Northgate Urban Center for development as a park. The 1993 Northgate Area Comprehensive Plan identified the site as a possible park, and there is considerable community expectation that the site will one day be a park. The site is currently owned by King County and is used as a park-and-ride facility. King County and the City of Seattle have negotiated a purchase and sale agreement, which provides for the sale of the property for $9,262,500. The City and County have also agreed to a related lease agreement, which provides that the County may, on a month-to-month basis, continue to use the property as a park-and-ride facility for up to 30 months. Development of a park on the site will likely not take place until after 2007 when King County is expected to relocate its park-and-ride facility to the south end of Northgate Mall.
