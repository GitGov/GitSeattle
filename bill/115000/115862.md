 AN ORDINANCE related to the revision of plumbing permit fees; amending Section 22.504.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2007, Section 22.504.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 120983, is amended as follows:

 22.504.010 Permit Fees.

 An applicant for a permit to do work under this Plumbing Code shall pay for each permit, at the time of issuance, a fee in accordance with the following schedule, and at the rate provided for each classification shown in the schedule:

 A. Schedule of Fees

 Base plumbing permit for one (1) fixture or trap $((95))110.00 (other than reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices or double check valve assemblies, for which a separate permit shall be obtained at the rates in this schedule)

 For each additional plumbing fixture or trap ((10))$12.00 (including water drainage vent piping and backflow protection therefor)

 For each atmospheric vacuum breaker in irrigation systems, tanks, vats, etc., or for installation on unprotected plumbing fixtures including necessary water piping

 Vacuum breaker-one (1) to five (5) - each device $10.00

 Vacuum breaker - over five (5) - each device $5.00

 Pressure vacuum breaker - each $10.00

 Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device or double check valve assembly

 Base plumbing permit for one (1) device or assembly ((95))$110.00

 Each additional device or assembly ((10))$12.00

 B. Fees for Miscellaneous Inspection Services

 Fees for inspection service outside regular working hours or for inspection service requested but not covered by a permit will be charged for at a rate equal to the cost of performing the service.

 Fees for permanent location inspection of factory $20.00 housing or modular unit containing plumbing - For each single-family dwelling or each modular unit containing plumbing

 Plumbing permit includes on-site connections of building drain extensions, water service and necessary gas piping connections.

 Additional plumbing fixtures installed after factory $10.00 installation of plumbing for each plumbing fixture or trap

 Fees for reconnection and retest of plumbing systems $20.00 in relocated buildings - For each building containing plumbing

 Plumbing permit includes on-site connections of building drain extensions, water service and necessary gas piping connections.

 Additional plumbing fixtures installed after $10.00 relocation for each plumbing fixture or trap

 C. For the purpose of this section, "fixture" means and includes an appliance that is connected with a water, drain or vent pipe, but a sillcock faucet or hose bibb is not considered a fixture. A sanitary plumbing outlet on or to which a plumbing fixture or appliance may be set or attached shall be construed to be a fixture.

 D. Any person who commenced any work for which a permit is required by this Plumbing Code without first having obtained such permit~~,~~ shall upon subsequent application for the permit pay double the fee fixed by the schedule of fees for the work in subsections A and B of this section unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the Administrative Authority that the work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit prior to the commencement of the work. In all such emergency cases, a permit shall be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there is an unreasonable delay in obtaining the permit, a double fee shall be charged as provided in this Code.

 E. A reinspection fee of One Hundred Fifteen Dollars ~~($100)~~($115.00) may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection if the portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or if corrections called for are not made. This subsection does not require inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with this Code, but ~~as controlling~~is intended to control the practice of calling for inspection or reinspection.

 Reinspection fees may be assessed if the permit is not properly posted on the work site, the work to be inspected is not under test, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested or for failure to make required corrections. Requests for reinspection shall be made in writing upon forms furnished for that purpose, and shall be accompanied by the reinspection fee in accordance with this section. If reinspection fees have been assessed, additional inspection of the work shall not be performed until the required fees have been paid.
