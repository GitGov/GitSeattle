 AN ORDINANCE relating to Local Improvement District (LID) No. 6750 (to construct a modern streetcar line serving downtown Seattle, Denny Triangle, and South Lake Union); adding a new section to Ordinance 121951 to authorize filing and confirmation of the final assessment roll before completion and acceptance of the improvement; appointing a hearing officer; authorizing the dollar amount for the Maximum Allowable Construction Contract (MACC); and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a two thirds vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Article VII, Section 9, of the Washington Constitution authorizes the legislature to vest special assessment powers in cities by statutory enactment, and the legislature has vested such powers to cities in, among others, chapters 35.43 and 35.44 RCW; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle established and codified in chapter 20.04 SMC certain procedures for the management of LID processes, and those procedures have not encompassed the full range of options for preparing the final assessment roll while an improvement is under way, as allowed in Chapters 35.43 and 35.44 RCW; and

 WHEREAS, by passing Council Bill 115504, amending chapter 20.04 SMC, the City Council has reconciled the procedures for management of LID processes consistent with the City's statutory powers; and

 WHEREAS, the ordinance that was introduced as Council Bill 115504, amending chapter 20.04 SMC, authorizes consideration of a final assessment roll at any time before, during or after the commencement or completion of the improvement; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121951 passed by the City Council on October 3, 2005, ordered the construction of a modern streetcar line serving downtown Seattle, Denny Triangle, and South Lake Union and created LID No. 6750; and

 WHEREAS, work is under way on portions of the improvement ordered in Ordinance 121951 (for example, the acquisition of street cars); and

 WHEREAS, if the City applies the remaining $2 million in South Lake Union property proceeds towards the South Lake Union Streetcar capital costs, as authorized in Ordinance 121951, a $2.8 million gap between project revenues and expenditures will remain; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121850 states that General Fund will not be used for the South Lake Union Streetcar line except as authorized in Section 1 of that ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council directs the Executive to continue working to secure alternative funding sources, other than the City's General Fund, to pay for any gap between the revenues and expenses associated with the construction of the South Lake Union Streetcar project; and

 WHEREAS, although it is the City Council's preference that the Executive secure grant revenues to pay for the gap between revenues and capital costs associated with the South Lake Union Streetcar project, the Executive has proposed using up to $2.5 million in revenues from the South Lake Union Developer Mitigation Payment Program and developer mitigation payments from other neighborhoods along the streetcar line if the Executive is unsuccessful in securing the necessary grants; and

 WHEREAS, the Council intends to use funds from the South Lake Union Developer Mitigation Payment Program and developer mitigation payments from other neighborhoods along the streetcar line if the City does not receive additional grants to cover the gap between revenues and capital costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive has agreed to provide the Transportation Committee with written quarterly reports on the revenues and expenditures associated with the construction of the South Lake Union Streetcar as described in Section 6 of this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, after completion of construction the Executive will provide the City Council with a final accounting of revenues and costs for the construction of the South Lake Union Streetcar project; and

 WHEREAS, after consulting with LID assessment payers and the City Council's Transportation Committee, the Executive will recommend a plan for paying for any gap between revenues and capital costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive's plan may include all revenue sources the city is authorized to use exclusive of General Fund revenue to cover any gap between revenues and capital costs; and

 WHEREAS, the current proposal to pay for the South Lake Union Streetcar contemplates a LID at $26.2 million; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has the authority to reassess or supplement the final assessment roll for LID 6750, pursuant to Chapter 35.44 RCW, to help pay for any difference between revenues and capital costs; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds it appropriate to authorize the maximum dollar amount of the Maximum Allowable Construction Contract (MACC) authorized under Ordinance 121951; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed assessment roll for LID No. 6750 has been prepared as provided by law, and the Council wishes to consider and finalize the assessment roll for LID No. 6750 prior to completion of the improvement in LID No. 6750; NOW, THEREFORE,

The Director of Executive Administration immediately shall post the proposed assessment roll upon his index of local improvement assessments against the properties affected by the local improvement.
