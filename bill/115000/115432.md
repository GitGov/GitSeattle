 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment, to be known as the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program Ordinance, creating an electric utility executive compensation program for the City Light Department, and specifying provisions for the administration of said compensation program; adding a program element to the strategic advisor and the manager compensation programs for electric utility pay administration and amending SMC 4.20.390.

 WHEREAS, the City requires competitive compensation in order to recruit, retain and motivate effective executives, managers and policy experts; and

 WHEREAS, City Light competes for talent in the highly competitive electric utility market; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council commissioned a study on City Light operations which recommended there be a stronger compensation program to attract the necessary talent to guide improvement of the electrical utility; and

 WHEREAS, the reorganization phase of the Transforming City Light initiative will result in some City Light positions being redesigned to be similar to comparable positions in other electric utilities both public and private; and

 WHEREAS, a compensation consultant's study commissioned by Seattle City Light has shown that the City's existing pay bands may in some specific cases be too low to recruit or retain employees in the electric utility market; and

 WHEREAS, as a department of Seattle's City government, City Light is subject to the same classification and compensation systems as other City departments; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Establishing a Compensation Program. As recommended by the Personnel Director, there is hereby established a discretionary pay program to be known as the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program to be used exclusively for positions working in the electric utility.

 A. Base Pay: The Electric Utility Executive pay band is hereby established as overlapping pay zones applicable to various position levels:

Position class or group Pay Zone

 Electric Utility Executive 3, Officer $66.09 - $105.36

 Electric Utility Executive 3, Director (below $57.66 - $92.24 Officer level)

 Electric Utility Executive 2 $44.21 - $70.74

 Electric Utility Executive 1 $38.45 - $61.52

 B. Short Term Performance Award: A lump sum payment of up to eight percent (8%) of base salary, in addition to base salary, may be awarded for recognition of the accomplishment of goals and work outcomes at the completion of the annual evaluation period. Any lump sum payment made pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a part of regular compensation prorated annually, for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and calculating retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System.

 C. Moving Expenses: Should there be relocation costs incurred by an employee in this pay band that exceed the moving expenses authorized in S.M.C. 4.14.150A, the City Light Department is authorized to pay reasonable and documented costs associated therewith from funds accumulating in the budget of the City Light Department. Should the employee terminate employment before completion of twelve months of service, or if the City terminates employment for cause, the relocation expenses shall be reimbursed by the employee as specified in SMC 4.14.150C.

 D. Designation of Positions in Program: The Personnel Director shall receive requests for inclusion of positions in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program and forward recommendations to a City of Seattle compensation committee which includes the Personnel Director, Chief Financial Officer and a specific designee of the Mayor. This compensation committee shall have the final authority to decide which positions shall be included in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program, whether a position is specific to the electric utility market, the title and pay zone to which each position shall be assigned and alternate pay zone authorization as contemplated in this section and Section 2 below. The City Light Department is authorized to use the titles in this program only for compensation committee approved positions working in the City Light Department. Authorization is not transferable to another position and cannot be used in another department.

 E. Individual Pay Authorization: The appointing authority shall have the discretion to pay employees appointed to positions in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Pay Program a salary within the designated position pay zone. The appointing authority may petition the Mayor or the Mayor's designated compensation committee for authorization to pay an employee in a pay zone for an alternate position within this program, and the Mayor or designated compensation committee is authorized to approve, deny or modify such petitions, within the parameters of the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program. Subsequent increases or modifications to such employee's base salary shall be in accordance with the Program.

 F. Plan Document:  The Personnel Director is authorized to develop and publish guidelines and a plan document to support administration of this Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program.

 G. Program Maintenance: The Personnel Director shall review the pay zones at least every two years and recommend pay zone adjustments for approval to the City Council. The titles and position incumbents assigned to these titles are not eligible for cost of living adjustments that may be granted to other non- represented positions and employees. Pay for any employee may not exceed the Pay Zone maximum for his or her position or alternate position as authorized by Section 1, Subsection E.

 Section 2. Amending SMC 4.20.390 for the Strategic Advisor and Manager Compensation Programs: Seattle Municipal Code 4.20.390 is hereby amended to make minor technical corrections and to add a program element to the Strategic Advisor and the Manager Compensation Programs as follows:

 SMC 4.20.390 Manager and Strategic Advisor Compensation Programs.

 A. There is established a Manager and a Strategic Advisor Compensation Program under which positions allocated to "Manager" and "Strategic Advisor" shall be compensated. The Personnel Director is authorized to administer the Strategic Advisor and the Manager Compensation Programs and to develop and maintain plan documents that describe each program's elements. Any revisions to the program elements must be approved by the Mayor and the City Council. The Personnel Director shall allocate positions into and out of Manager and Strategic Advisor titles in accordance with established rules and procedures.

 B. The salary structure for the Manager and the Strategic Advisor Compensation Programs shall each consist of one (1) pay band with three (3) pay zones. Pay zone assignment shall constitute the classification for all relevant provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code and the Personnel Rules. Where occupational groups have been designated, the occupational group shall constitute the class series. The appointing authority shall have the discretion to set and/or modify base salary anywhere within the pay zone for any Manager or Strategic Advisor under his or her direction, within formal budget and spending limits established by the Mayor and the City Council. The Personnel Director shall recommend to the City Council for approval market adjustments to the salary structure based on a biennial labor market analysis of selected benchmark titles. The appointing authority may award to each Strategic Advisor or Manager under his or her direction a base salary increase up to the maximum approved market adjustment; provided that no Manager or Strategic Advisor shall be eligible for such an adjustment if his or her performance in the most recent evaluation cycle failed to be described as "satisfactory" or better. Other adjustments to base salaries must be made in accordance with Program Guidelines and within budget and spending guidelines.

 C. The Personnel Director will establish performance recognition guidelines for the Manager and Strategic Advisor Compensation Programs. The appointing authority may award to a Manager or Strategic Advisor under his or her direction a lump sum payment of up to eight (8) percent of base salary, in addition to base salary, for recognition of the accomplishment of goals and work outcomes at the completion of an annual evaluation period. Any lump sum payment made pursuant to this section shall be considered a part of regular compensation, prorated annually, for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and calculating retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the City Employees Retirement System.

D. On a case by case basis, the Mayor, or a compensation committee designated by the Mayor to serve this purpose, may give written authorization for a regular employee in a Manager or Strategic Advisor position working in the City Light Department to receive a salary which is above the top of the position's regular pay zone and within one of the pay zones for Electric Utility Executive specified in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program. If necessary for recruiting purposes, such authorization may be given for use in a job offer, in advance of the hiring of an employee. An offer to pay a regularly appointed City Light Manager or Strategic Advisor within a pay zone authorized by the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program may not be part of a job offer unless approved in advance by the Mayor or the compensation committee. This option is limited to regularly appointed employees in the Manager and the Strategic Advisor Programs within City Light and cannot be retroactively applied to a position or employee more than 30 days prior to the Personnel Director's receipt of the appointing authority's request for the exception.. Such alternate zone pay authorizations may be reviewed at any time by the Personnel Director or designee, and may be altered, revoked, or otherwise limited by the Mayor or the Mayor's designated compensation committee.

Section 3. Employees in City Light positions for which alternate zone pay authorization has been granted in accordance with provisions of this ordinance shall not receive any subsequent pay increases except by new written authorization.

 Section 4. The Superintendent of City Light is hereby authorized to use unexpended and unencumbered funds accumulating in his budget to pay the compensation authorized herein.

 Section 5. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2005.
