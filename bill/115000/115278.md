 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent to enter into two long-term contract amendments with Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County to: 1) convert a portion of Priest Rapids non-firm energy purchase into a slice of firm and non-firm energy purchase; and 2) extend by six weeks the time at which the District is required to provide estimated power costs for the following year.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle entered into three new long-term power purchase agreements with the District on March 11, 2002 (Ordinance 120743) to replace one 50-year power purchase contract expiring October 31, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, one of the three new contracts, the "Additional Products Sales Agreement," provided for the City to purchase a portion of non- firm energy from the Priest Rapids Project; and

 WHEREAS, the "Additional Products Sales Agreement" has been determined by the District to be unreasonably difficult to implement; and

 WHEREAS, the District has proposed terminating the "Additional Products Sales Agreement" and replacing it with an amendment to the concurrent "Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract," with the amendment providing Seattle an equivalent "slice" of firm and non-firm energy to replace the non-firm energy lost by terminating the "Additional Products Sales Agreement"; and

 WHEREAS, the amendment to the "Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract" will provide the City a fixed slice of firm and non-firm project output through the entire project license term approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and

 WHEREAS, changes to the aforementioned two contracts will cause a change to Exhibit A of the third contract with the District, the "Priest Rapids Project Reasonable Portion Power Sales Contract," requiring corrections; and

 WHEREAS, the District wishes to extend by six weeks the reporting requirement for estimating annual power costs for the following contract year in Section 5 (f) of the "Priest Rapids Project Reasonable Portion Power Sales Contract"; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into two long-term contract amendments with Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, entitled: (1) "Amendment No. 2 to the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract and Termination of Additional Product Sales Agreement"; and (2) "Amendment No. 2 to the Priest Rapids Project Reasonable Portion Power Sales Contract," both substantially in the form of the contract amendments attached to this ordinance as Attachments 1 and 2, respectively. Attachment 1 converts the non-firm energy that was to be purchased under the former "Additional Product Sales Agreement" into an approximately equivalent "slice" of both firm and non-firm energy under the "Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract." Attachment 2 does two things: (a) it makes corrections to Exhibit A of the "Priest Rapids Project Reasonable Portion Power Sales Contract" that are necessary because of the first "Amendment No. 2" (Attachment 1); and (b) it allows the District a six-week extension for providing annual power costs to City Light for the following contract year for improved accuracy of estimates.

 Section 2. Following Council adoption, any acts taken in furtherance of this ordinance, but prior to its effective date, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2005.
