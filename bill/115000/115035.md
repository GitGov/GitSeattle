 EXHIBIT 1

 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

 Between

 Seattle City Light, Energy Management Services Division,

 Seattle Central Community College Continuing Education

 and the Sustainable Development Training Institute

 for promotion, management, and licensing of the

 Sustainable Building Advisor Program (SBAP)

 This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is made and entered into by The City of Seattle City Light (SCL), P.O. Box 34023, 700 5th Avenue, Suite 3300, Seattle, WA 98124, and Seattle Central Community College Continuing Education (SCCC), 1701 Broadway, Seattle, WA 98122, and O'Brien and Company, Inc., through its Sustainable Development Training Institute Division (SDTI), P.O. Box 10705, Bainbridge Island, WA 98110, collectively referred to as the "Parties." As more fully described below, the purpose of the MOU is to market and license the Sustainable Building Advisor Program (SBAP), and to provide SBAP student certification, to institutions, known as "Providers," who wish to provide the SBAP in their service area. Licensing will occur through a "Program License Agreement," Attachment "A" to this memorandum of understanding. .

 For the mutual promises contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is mutually acknowledged, the Parties agree to the following:

 I. BACKGROUND

 The Northwest Regional Sustainable Building Action Plan, developed under a Department of Energy and Urban Consortium Energy Task Force in 1998 and 1999, identified Industry Education as one of seven strategies to achieve more sustainable building in the Northwest Region of the United States and British Columbia, through development of a curriculum and training and education of key sectors of the building industry. The Northwest Regional Sustainable Building Action plan also identified Public Education as another of seven strategies, by developing a comprehensive public education and communication program.

 In 2000, SCL partnered with SCCC to develop a curriculum and assemble instructors to provide a class at Seattle Central Community College known as the Sustainable Building Advisor Certificate Program (SBAP). After the first year of instruction, SCL began receiving inquiries from other utilities, municipalities and two federal government agencies regarding SCL's willingness to make SBAP more widely available, and expressing interest in providing similar instruction in their own jurisdictions.

 SCL solely entered into a "Work For Hire" agreement with the consulting firm O'Brien and Company, Inc. to have curriculum and training materials prepared for use by other utilities, municipalities and educational institutions (SBAP Training Materials). Through SCL's ownership of the SBAP Training Materials, it will license use of the SBAP training materials and other services as described in the Program License Agreement, attached as Exhibit A.

 II. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

 The purpose of the MOU is to define the relationship between the Parties as they jointly market SCL's licensing of its SBAP as a complete training program.

 Mission in Promoting SBAP

 * Expose design and building professionals to the knowledge and experience of experts who have practiced all aspects of sustainable building;

 * Provide design and building professionals with a framework within which to integrate the fundamental components of a building project in order to optimize building performance to the needs of its owners and occupants as well as the community and environment in which it will be placed;

 * Nurture a community of committed, informed and innovative sustainable building professionals who will continue to network with one another for support and to capitalize on every opportunity to enhance the sustainability of our built environment;

 * To allow local providers to award local certificates of completion for those who complete the course requirements; and,

 * To encourage students who successfully complete the SBAP training to take an examination for the SBAP certificate.

 Purpose, to offer the Sustainable Advisor Program through the following means:

 * Directly, through the nine-month course hosted by SCL and SCCC, with this SCL/SCCC partnership agreed to be the local provider in the greater Seattle metropolitan/Puget Sound region with SCL/SCCC having the right to use the SBAP training materials for the SBAP course without purchasing a Program License Agreement so long as the Parties agree;

 * Indirectly, through licensed providers in locations around the country. Licensed providers purchase the rights to use SBAP training materials to teach a nine month SBAP course to working professionals in their jurisdiction or locale;

 * By providing SBAP training, training materials and direction to teachers and professionals in the licensed provider service area who are well versed in the broad goals of sustainable building, knowledgeable of local conditions, and experts in their respective fields;

 * By providing professionals who complete course requirements to receive a certificate from their local provider and become eligible to receive a national SBAP certificate by successfully passing an on-line examination hosted by the SBAP proctored on-line examination service;

If Licensor prevails and has been represented by the Seattle City Attorney, its attorneys' fees shall be computed on the basis of those of a private attorney in downtown Seattle who practices in a firm having as many attorneys as are employed in the Seattle City Attorney's Office, and who has experience comparable to Licensor's attorney.

 14. Partial Invalidity.

 If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder shall not be affected thereby.

 15. Survival of Provisions.

 Any obligation of the parties relating to moneys owed, as well as those provisions relating to indemnification, limitations on liability and actions, obligations to refrain from offering similar programs after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, and Licensor's remedies if Licensee fails to refrain from such activity, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 16. Equal Employment Opportunity and Nondiscrimination.

 Licensee shall comply with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle.

 17. Nondiscrimination in Employee Benefits

 a. Licensee shall comply with the requirements of Seattle Municipal Code ("S.M.C.") Ch. 20.45 and Equal Benefits Program Rules implementing such requirements, under which the Licensee is obligated to provide the same or equivalent benefits ("Equal Benefits") to its employees with domestic partners as the Licensee provides to its employees with spouses. At the Licensor's request, the Licensee shall provide complete information and verification of the Licensee's compliance with S.M.C. Ch. 20.45. Failure to cooperate with such a request shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. (For further information about S.M.C. Ch. 20.45 and the Equal Benefits Program Rules call (206) 684-0202 or review information at http://cityofseattle.net/contract/equalbenefits/)

 b. Any violation of the provisions of S.M.C. Ch. 20.45 shall be a material breach of the Agreement for which the Licensee shall be subject to the remedies thereunder, including but not limited to payment of liquidated damages in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) for each day that the Licensee is in violation of S.M.C. Ch. 20.45 during the term of the Agreement, termination of the Agreement, disqualification of Licensee from bidding on or being awarded a City of Seattle Contract for a period of up to five (5) years, and/or other remedies as specifically provided for in S.M.C. Ch. 20.45 and the Equal Benefits Program Rules promulgated thereunder.

 18. Nonwaiver

 The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of its right to assert or rely upon any such provisions or rights in that or any other instance; rather, the same shall be and remain in full force.

 19. Rights Cumulative

 The rights and remedies of the parties provided for under this Agreement are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law. The failure to exercise on any occasion any right shall not operate to forfeit such right on another occasion. The use of one remedy shall not exclude or waive the right to use another.

 20. Headings

 The titles of sections are for convenience only and do not define or limit the contents.

 21. Non-Exclusivity

 This is a non-exclusive arrangement.

 23. Contractual Relationship

 This Agreement does not constitute the Licensee as the agent or legal representative of the Licensor for any purpose whatsoever. The Licensee is not granted any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of or in the name of Licensor or to bind Licensor in any manner or thing whatsoever. In no event shall Licensor be construed or held to have become in any way or for any purpose a partner, associate, or joint venture of the Licensee or any party associated with the Licensee in the conduct of the Licensee's business or otherwise.

 24. Amendment.

 This Agreement may only be amended by a written amendment signed by both parties.

 25. Severability.

 In the event that any term of this Agreement is invalid, becomes invalid during this Agreement, or is declared invalid or void by any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, such invalid term or terms shall be void and of no affect are deemed severed from this Agreement. All of the remaining terms of this

 Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
