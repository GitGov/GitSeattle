 Section 2. The 2006 Table of Proposed Projects represents the City's plan, and proposal to HUD, for the use of the funds shown as allocated in the 2006 Table of Proposed Projects. The Plan as amended by the Adopted 2006 Update, including such table, changes in strategies, housing policies, and allocation policies as is contained in the Adopted 2006 Update, is intended to serve the functions set forth in 24 CFR Section 91.1(b).

The authority of the respective City departments and offices to implement the activities set forth in the Adopted 2006 Update is subject to sufficient appropriations in the 2006 Adopted Budget or in any separate ordinance. Implementation of any specific project or program is also subject to a final determination by the appropriate office or department after completion of any necessary review under environmental and related laws.
