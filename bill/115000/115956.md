 WHEREAS, the Foundation wishes to fund the design and construction of certain improvements to the Arboretum's Pacific Connections project ("Project") provided the City agrees to contract for and manage the design and construction of the project in accordance with the City's public works processes; and

 WHEREAS, DPR has commenced the design of the Project and the parties now desire to memorialize the terms and conditions under which the City will cause the design to be completed and the Project constructed;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

 1. Authority and Ownership

 The parties acknowledge and agree that the City owns the Washington Park Arboretum (including, when completed, the improvements that comprise the Project referred to herein) and that the Superintendent has final administrative and decision-making authority with respect to every aspect of the Arboretum and the Project, including decisions regarding on-going maintenance and operation.

 2. Approval of Project Design

 The City has contracted with The Portico Group ("Architect") to design all phases of the Washington Park Arboretum Pacific Connections Project ("Project") and DPR agrees to maintain the Architect's contract in force so long as the Foundation is not in default under this Agreement. The parties have reviewed all Project documents to date, including but not limited to, the design development plans prepared by the Architect, dated 6/21/06, and are satisfied with the design for the Project as described therein. It is the Parties' expectation that the Project design will be completed and that the Project will be constructed in accordance with the approved design concept. The Foundation shall have the right to review and comment on each subsequent design phases in a time frame and under conditions that the Superintendent reasonably establishes to avoid delay. The Foundation agrees to give all comments to DPR and not give direction to the Architect.

 3. Project Costs

 The Foundation agrees to pay all Project costs up to a maximum of $2,207,000, as outlined in the Project Budget chart below. The Parties have estimated the Project Budget components and agree that the amounts shown may be reallocated within the categories identified, provided that in no event shall the Foundation be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the Total Project Budget without its express consent. DPR shall not authorize any contract change or expenditure or commitment of funds in excess of the Total Project Budget unless and until the parties have mutually agreed to the change and identified a source of funding therefore.

The Foundation may withdraw from and terminate this Agreement without recourse only prior to the date the City awards the Project construction contract. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Foundation shall remain liable for all costs incurred by the City in furtherance of the Project prior to the effective termination date.
