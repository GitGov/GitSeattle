 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income housing; authorizing an amendment to the Housing Cooperation Agreement authorized by Ordinances 112904 and 113562 between The City of Seattle and the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle concerning the 1986 Seattle Housing Levy; making changes in the Scattered Site Housing for Large Families Program; authorizing the sale of up to 46 Scattered Site units by Seattle Housing Authority and amending Ordinance 112904 to allow the use of the sale proceeds by the Seattle Housing Authority for relocation of tenants and other costs related to the sales and to replacement affordable units; and authorizing related agreements and actions.

 WHEREAS, the $49.975 million Housing Levy authorized by Seattle Ordinance 112904 and approved by Seattle voters in September 1986 (the "1986 Levy") provided for allocation of $12 million for the Scattered Site Housing for Large Families Program for the development of approximately 150 units of housing for large, extremely-low income families; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 112904 charged the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle ("Housing Authority") with the responsibility of administering the Scattered Site Housing for Large Families Program ("Large Families Program"), which responsibilities were more particularly set forth in the Housing Cooperation Agreement authorized by Ordinance 113562 and executed August 27, 1987, which was later amended pursuant to Ordinance 119060 (as amended, the "Housing Cooperation Agreement"); and

 WHEREAS, the Housing Authority did acquire 147 units of housing with Large Family Housing Program Funds, together with additional federal funds, and currently operates those units; and

 WHEREAS, due to changes in funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and high per unit management and operating costs for the Large Family Program units, which are predominately single-family homes or duplexes, it is no longer feasible for Seattle Housing Authority to operate the entire portfolio of these units; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 112904 provided that the City Council could make changes in programs in light of changes in housing conditions, and the City Council has made changes in the Large Family Program from time to time; and

 WHEREAS, the terms of the Large Family Program have been defined by the Administrative and Financial Plans for that program, the latest of which was approved in Ordinance 116645; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 112904 provided that properties acquired by Seattle Housing Authority for the Large Family Program could be sold if the use of such housing units were no longer feasible or if such sale would further the purposes of that ordinance by increasing the supply of housing for low-income households, but only with the approval of the City as provided in the Housing Cooperation Agreement, and further provided that amendments to the Housing Cooperation Agreement could be authorized by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Housing Authority has developed a plan ("the Replacement Plan") to dispose of 46 Scattered Site Large Family units, in 1-2 unit buildings, and replace these units with a greater number of affordable housing units in buildings or clusters typically containing 6-20 units, allowing greater operating efficiency; and

 WHEREAS, the City expects that the Seattle Housing Authority's sale of the 46 scattered site units will provide sufficient proceeds to acquire a minimum of 56 units of affordable housing; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Housing Authority is committed to maintaining, to the extent feasible, the same overall unit size for the entire Scattered Site Program portfolio as existed prior to beginning the disposition of units; and

 WHEREAS, the Replacement Plan includes a commitment to maintain housing affordability under City regulatory requirements for an additional 40 years from the date of replacement; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 112904, as amended by Ordinance 113834, states that the proceeds of any sale of housing acquired under the Large Families Program shall be remitted to the City for deposit in the 1986 Housing Levy Account of the Low-income Housing Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the City and Housing Authority both desire that instead of remitting sale proceeds to the Low-Income Housing Fund, the Housing Authority will use the proceeds from the sale for relocation and replacement of housing as described in its Replacement Plan; and

 WHEREAS, in order to authorize the Replacement Plan the City and the Housing Authority desire to amend the provisions of the Housing Cooperation Agreement;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds that there have been changes in housing conditions since the adoption of Ordinance 112904 in 1986 such that the purpose of the 1986 Levy will be best served by a change in the Scattered Site Housing Program for Large Families ("Large Family Program") and by an amendment to the Housing Cooperation Agreement. The changed conditions include, without limitation: (a) funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to the Housing Authority under the annual contributions contract, which is the source of operating and capital subsidy for the Large Family Program units, has not kept pace with inflation or maintenance needs, (b) average operating costs for the Large Family Program housing are substantially higher and have increased faster than the average per-unit operating costs for other Housing Authority units and (c) due to price appreciation in single- family and other small properties in Seattle, the Housing Authority can sell a portion of the Large Family Program units and generate sufficient proceeds to replace these units with a minimum of 56 City- regulated affordable housing units in approximately 6-20 unit buildings, which will achieve much greater operating efficiencies.

 Section 2. The Mayor is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, an amendment to the Housing Cooperation Agreement with the Seattle Housing Authority, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit "A" and identified as "Second Amendment to Housing Cooperation Agreement between The City of Seattle and the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle for Implementation of 1986 Housing Levy Programs" (the "Amendment").

 Section 3. The 1986 Levy Large Families Program, as previously amended, and the latest Administrative and Financial Plan for that Program, as approved by Ordinance 116645, are amended to incorporate the Scattered Site Housing Replacement Plan, attached as Exhibit "B" and identified as "Amendment to Scattered Site Large Family Housing Program," providing for the sale of up to 46 units, which are identified on Exhibit C to this ordinance, and authorizing the Housing Authority to use the proceeds for relocation of existing tenants, replacement with at least 56 City-regulated affordable housing units, and administrative costs directly related to the sales and replacement housing, rather than remit the proceeds to the City's Low-Income Housing Fund.

 Section 4. The Housing Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, modify, accept, record, and administer such additional agreements and instruments, and take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to implement the Amendment and Plan authorized by this Ordinance.

 Section 5. Section 9 of Ordinance 112904, as amended by Ordinance 113834, is hereby amended as follows:

 Section 9. Disposal of Acquired Properties. Any property or housing units developed, acquired, constructed or rehabilitated by the City, its agents or the Seattle Housing Authority with the proceeds of the levy may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the City, its agents or the Seattle Housing Authority, respectively, to the extent permitted by law if use of such housing units for the purposes of this ordinance is no longer feasible or if such sale or other disposition would further the purposes of this ordinance by increasing the supply of housing for low-income households, but only with the approval of the City in such manner as may be provided in the Housing Cooperation Agreement. The proceeds of any such sale, including interest if the sale is on a deferred payment basis, shall be remitted to the City for deposit in the 1986 Housing Levy Account of the Low-Income Housing Fund or, to the extent approved by ordinance, shall be used by the Seattle Housing Authority to acquire, construct or improve property to be used as replacement low-income housing and pay costs directly related to such sales and such replacement housing, which costs may include administrative costs and relocation of tenants. In addition, the proceeds from any such sale shall not be used for replacement housing or other activities associated with the redevelopment of the Seattle Housing Authority's garden communities.

Section 6. If any provision of this ordinance shall be determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, such determination shall in no way affect, impair, or invalidate any other provision hereof, and such other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 Section 7. Any act pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Exhibit A to Ordinance

 SECOND AMENDMENT TO HOUSING COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF 1986 HOUSING LEVY PROGRAMS

 This Amendment is made between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a Washington municipal corporation, and the HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("Housing Authority"), a Washington public body corporate and politic, amending the HOUSING COOPERATION AGREEMENT executed August 27, 1987, with respect to the 1986 Housing Levy.

 RECITALS

 The $49.975 million Housing Levy proposed for authorization by Seattle Ordinance 112904 and approved by Seattle voters in September 1986 (the "Levy") allocated $12 million to the Scattered Site Housing for Large Families Program ("Large Family Program"). Ordinance 112904 charged the Housing Authority with the responsibility of administering the Large Family Program. The responsibilities of the Housing Authority were more particularly set forth in the Housing Cooperation Agreement authorized by Ordinance 113562 and executed August 27, 1987, which was later amended by an amendment authorized by Ordinance 119060.

 The City Council, on recommendation of the Mayor and Director of the Office of Housing, has found that a change in housing conditions has occurred such that it would better serve the purpose of the 1986 Levy to authorize the Housing Authority to sell at market value up to 46 of the units acquired under the Large Family Program and for the Housing Authority to use the proceeds from these dispositions to relocate tenants in suitable affordable units and to replace the Scattered Site units sold with at least 56 City-restricted affordable housing units citywide.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows:

 1. Definitions, Amended. The definitions of the following capitalized terms defined in Article II of the Agreement are hereby amended to read in their entirety as follows. Such terms, wherever appearing in the Agreement (including this Second Amendment), shall have the meanings set forth below, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

 5. "Department" means The City of Seattle Office of Housing.

 6. "Director" means the Director of The City of Seattle Office of Housing.

 30a. "Seattle-Everett SMSA" means the Seattle-Bellevue HFMA of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue MSA, or such other area including the City of Seattle that may be used by HUD for purposes of establishing income limits for low-income housing.

 2. Authorized Disposition of Large Family Units; Replacement Units

 The following subsection is added to Section 4 of Article III, LARGE FAMILY PROGRAM:

 4.H. Disposition and Replacement of Large Family Units.

 (1) Sale of 46 Units Authorized; Any time after July 1, 2006 and prior to July 1, 2010, the Housing Authority may sell up to 46 Large Family units, identified on Exhibit C to this Agreement, at market prices. However, SHA shall make 10 of the 46 units available for sale to eligible non-profit housing developers at a price determined via a Comparable Market Analysis (CMA) performed by a licensed professional. Non-profit housing developers shall have 20 business days from receipt of the CMA to sign a purchase and sale agreement. Non-profit housing developers desiring to purchase such units shall agree to close the sale of such units within 45 days of signing a purchase and sale agreement and shall agree to purchase such units without any contingencies, such as inspections, condition of property, financing, etc. In addition, non-profits desiring to purchase such units shall agree to the following affordability restrictions: For units that will be purchased for homeownership, the units shall be affordable to households earning at or below 80% of median income for a minimum of 100 years.

 (2) Use of Proceeds. The gross proceeds of sales from the 46 units, net of costs actually paid to third parties for commissions, closing costs and buyers' title insurance premiums, are referred to as the "Sale Proceeds." The Housing Authority shall use the Sales Proceeds solely for the following purposes:

 (a) Costs directly related to disposition of the Sold Units, including administrative costs and costs of relocation of tenants in the Sold Units; and

 (b) Capital Costs, which may include direct administrative costs, for acquisition and improvement of housing units within the City of Seattle that satisfy all of the requirements of this subsection H for Levy Replacement Units.

 In addition, the proceeds from the sale of the 46 Large Family units shall not be used for replacement housing or other activities associated with the redevelopment of the Seattle Housing Authority's garden communities.

 Pending expenditure of Sales Proceeds for authorized purposes, the Housing Authority shall maintain Sales Proceeds in an interest- bearing account or a separately identified Housing Authority sub- account to which interest is credited proportionately with other Housing Authority subaccounts. Interest earned on such funds shall be considered additional Sales Proceeds for all purposes hereunder.

 (3) Levy Replacement Units. The Housing Authority shall use Sales Proceeds and any other resources necessary to secure a minimum of 56 units to replace the Sale Units as housing subject to the Agreement. The Housing Authority shall improve such units to the extent necessary to satisfy the terms of this Section. All units acquired or improved wholly or in part with Sales Proceeds, and any additional units acquired by the Housing Authority with other resources to satisfy the terms of this subsection, are referred to as "Levy Replacement Units." The Levy Replacement Units shall be considered low-income housing that is developed pursuant to the Large Family Program for all purposes under this Agreement. The Housing Authority shall ensure that all Levy Replacement Units meet Housing Quality Standards, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and verified by the Housing Authority. Each of 46 Levy Replacement Units shall have a minimum of three bedrooms. The additional Levy Replacement Units acquired above the 46 units shall have an average size ofat least 2.5 bedrooms.

 (4) Replacement Plan. In the sale of units pursuant to subsection (1) above, the relocation of tenants, and the acquisition, improvement, ownership and operation of Levy Replacement Units, the Housing Authority shall comply with the terms of the Replacement Plan approved by the ordinance authorizing the Second Amendment to this Cooperation Agreement "Replacement Plan". Each Levy Replacement Unit shall be owned and operated by the Housing Authority under the same terms as units originally acquired with Large Family Program funds, and shall be subject to all the same terms and conditions, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Cooperation Agreement or the Replacement Plan. Each Levy Replacement Unit shall, subject only to the availability of low-income public housing subsidy from the federal government or from other sources, be operated as housing for Extremely Low-Income Households for a period of at least forty (40) years after the date when the Housing Authority certifies that such unit has been placed in service by the Housing Authority as a Levy Replacement Unit in conformity with the terms of this Cooperation Agreement and is occupied by an eligible household, unless and until the City Council shall approve an earlier disposition of a Levy Replacement Unit. In the event that operating subsidies are not available, the provisions of the Cooperation Agreement, Article III, Section 7, shall apply with regard to rent.

 (5) Reporting. The Housing Authority shall provide reports to the City's Office of Housing twice a year, not later than January 30 and July 31, providing a full accounting of all sales, gross and net proceeds thereof, Sales Proceeds, expenditures of Sales Proceeds and a list of properties disposed and acquired, with property addresses, number of units, bedroom size and acquisition and improvement costs. Each report shall include information for the previous six-month period and also shall include cumulative information regarding all sales, receipts, expenditures, and Levy Replacement Units. In addition, within six (6) months after the end of the last calendar year in which any activity with respect to sales or acquisition of Levy Replacement Units occurs, and in any case no later than June 30, 2012, the Housing Authority shall deliver to the City's Office of Housing a complete report of the use of Sales Proceeds, certified by the chief financial officer of the Housing Authority and audited by the Housing Authority's independent auditor.

 3. Exception to Requirement for Deposit of Sale Proceeds

 Article VIII, Section 3. Sale of Excess Property, is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

 Any real property constituting a part of the Housing may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Housing Authority to the extent permitted by law if utilization of such housing units for the purposes described in the Ordinance is no longer feasible or if such sale or other disposition would further the purposes of the Ordinance by increasing the supply of housing for Low-Income Families with Children, the homeless and other Low-Income Households; provided that any sale must be approved by the City Council by Resolution or Ordinance and upon such terms and conditions as it may impose. The proceeds of any such sale, including interest if the sale is on a deferred-payment basis, shall be remitted to The City for deposit in the Low-Income Housing Assistance Fund to be used for the same purposes as authorized for the use of the Levy funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Housing Authority is authorized to use the proceeds of sales of up to 46 housing units as authorized under subsection III.4H of this Cooperation Agreement for the purposes set forth in that subsection, provided that any Sales Proceeds, as defined in Article III, Section 4, paragraph H(1) above, not so used on or before July 2, 2011 shall be immediately paid to the City for deposit in the Low Income Housing Fund.

 4. Termination. Article VIII, Section 6 is hereby amended as follows:

 6. Termination. Either party may terminate the Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other if:

 A. A final judicial determination has been rendered that determines that this Agreement (not including any amendment hereto) and/or the Housing Levy violates the law in any material respect, and the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days upon amendments to bring the same into compliance with the decision of the court.

 B. Both parties, in writing, agree or assent thereto.

 C. The other party has committed a material breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, by a single action or omission, or a series of repeated actions or omissions, and such party fails to cure such breach within a reasonable time after written notice demanding cure of the breach.

 D. Changes in law shall deprive either party of the legal authority to perform the duties required by the Agreement.

 Termination by The City under this paragraph may be authorized only by ordinance. Termination by the Housing Authority under this paragraph may be authorized only with the concurrence of a majority of the members of its Board of Commissioners. Termination shall be by written notice delivered by the party terminating to the other party. The termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after giving such notice.

 5. Integration; Counterparts. This Second Amendment culminates the negotiations and discussions between the City and the Housing Authority concerning the amendment of the Agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements, statements and intentions with respect to the amendment of the Agreement. This Second Amendment shall be executed in two counterparts, one for each of the parties, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and the same instrument. Except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the Agreement as previously amended remains in full force and effect.

 6. Severability. If any provision of this Second Amendment, or of the Agreement as amended hereby, shall be determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, such determination shall in no way affect, impair, or invalidate any other provision hereof or of the Agreement, and such other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The deletion or modification, pursuant to the terms of this Amendment, of any provision of the Agreement shall not impair the validity of any action taken consistent with such provision prior to the effective date of such deletion or modification.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF The City and the Housing Authority have executed this Amendment this _____ day of __________________, 2006.

 Exhibit B to Ordinance

 Amendment to Scattered Site Housing for Large Families Program

 Scattered Site Housing Replacement Plan

 Due to a change in housing conditions and subsidy provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the City has authorized the Housing Authority to sell up to 46 Scattered Site Large Family Units acquired or developed with 1986 Seattle Housing Levy Funds ("Sale Units"). The City has also authorized the Housing Authority to use the proceeds from the sale of these units for relocation of the tenants and for acquisition of a minimum of 56 city-regulated affordable housing units ("the Levy Replacement Units"). In order to induce the City to grant such authorization, the Housing Authority has agreed to the following provisions (the "Replacement Plan"), which, together with the terms of the Housing Cooperation Agreement, as amended, apply to the Levy Replacement Units in lieu of any other Housing Levy policies:

 Tenant Relocation: The Housing Authority shall assist the tenants of the Sale Units to find alternative, suitable affordable housing. For all such tenants that are not evicted for just cause ("Eligible Tenants"), the Housing Authority shall comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding tenant notification and relocation, including the provisions of 24 CFR Section 970.5(e). In any event, the Housing Authority shall offer to provide safe, sanitary, decent replacement housing in another unit of suitable size for the household at a monthly rent that, together with a reasonable allowance for utilities, does not exceed the rent and utility costs paid by the tenant in the Sale Unit.

 With regard to any tenants in property acquired by the Housing Authority as Replacement Units, the Housing Authority shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding tenant notification and relocation. The Housing Authority acknowledges that for purposes of SMC Chapter 20.84, the Levy Replacement Units shall be considered to have been acquired with City financial assistance. If the acquisition and any improvement to the Levy Replacement Units are part of a program or project carried out with Federal financial assistance, within the meaning of SMC Chapter 20.84, then the requirements of that chapter will not apply.

 Type of Development: Each of 46 Levy Replacement Units will have a minimum of three bedrooms. The additional Levy Replacement Units acquired above the 46 units shall have an average size of 2.5 bedrooms. Levy Replacement Units shall be in buildings with no more than 20 units per building and the Levy Replacement Units shall be in a minimum of at least five buildings.

 Ownership: The Levy Replacement Units will be owned and operated by the Housing Authority in accordance with the Occupancy and Rent limits below for a period of at least 40 years after placed in service as Levy Replacement Units.

 Occupancy and Rent Requirements: Levy Replacement Units will be occupied solely by households that are Extremely Low-Income Households as of the later of the date of initial occupancy by such household or the date of acquisition by the Housing Authority. Such households will contribute approximately 30% of income for rent, provided that the Housing Authority is able to secure operating subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or another source. In the event that operating subsidies are not available, the provisions of the Cooperation Agreement, Article III, Section 7, shall apply with regard to rent.
