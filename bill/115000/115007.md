 1. PURPOSE

 This Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is entered into for the purpose of defining and limiting a mutually beneficial arrangement whereby the Parks provides partial funding for public improvements to District- owned property in the area of the Plaza. The proposed improvements to the Plaza funded by the Department of Parks and Recreation will be designed and constructed by the District. The proposed improvements will be subject to approvals of both parties as detailed in paragraph 3.1. After the improvements are constructed, the District will allow the Parks non-exclusive use of the Plaza as a public area in conjunction with the District's operation of adjacent District property (i.e., New School at South Shore) and the Department of Parks and Recreation property (i.e., Rainier Beach Community Center).

 2. FUNDING AND TERM

 2.1 Funding and approval by the Department of Parks and Recreation will be made in two parts. The Department of Parks and Recreation has $140,000 to transfer to the District for design and construction of mutually agreed and approved improvements to the Plaza. The first part (Part A), due at execution of this agreement to cover design development costs, will be the transfer of 20% ($28,000) by September 15, 2004. The second part (Part B) will be the transfer of the remaining 80% ($112,000) at the time of advertisement for bid. The Part B transfer will be refundable to Parks should the District fail to bid and award the project or complete improvements within a two- year period from the Part B date.

 2.2 This Agreement shall commence on the final date of all signatures to this agreement and shall continue in force and effect so long as Parks and the District continue their joint/shared use of the New School at South Shore and the Rainier Beach Community Center. Park's non-exclusive use shall continue for so long as mutually acceptable to both parties. Either party may terminate this Agreement at will upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other.

 2.3 Parks' financial liability is limited to funds appropriated for the project and such funds are available only through City Of Seattle approved appropriation. Parks' shall not become contractually obligated to pay any additional project cost contemplated under this MOA except for those resulting from Parks' actions.
