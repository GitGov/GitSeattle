The project was included in the 2005-2010 Adopted CIP, but was put on hold in 2005 pending resolution of zoning issues and the transfer of development credits from King County. SDOT recently received $295,660 in development credit revenue and can begin working with King County and the Department of Neighborhoods to define the scope of work. King County is also holding a $400,000 federal grant, to be released to the City once a project agreement has been executed.

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, includes the inflation allowance for projects in the Neighborhood Park Development Program (Budget Control Level K723003). The project supplies inflation allowance for projects on a case-by-case basis, subject to Department recommendations. As a project begins the planning phase, the inflation allowance is calculated and transferred from this project to the actual project budget.

In 2006, upon the recommendation of the Pro Parks Oversight Committee, approximately $500,000 was transferred from this project to several neighborhood park development projects to cover an additional inflation allowance. This allowance was provided to projects that had not yet begun construction to assure that higher than normal inflation in recent years would not reduce the original planned scope of these projects. In addition, the Committee recommended transferring $640,000 to three projects (California Substation, Colman Playfield and Orchard Street Ravine) in order to complete or expand the scope of these projects.

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, develops approximately five athletic fields at Warren G. Magnuson Park. Some or all of these fields will have synthetic surfaces and be lighted. As part of Phase 2, this project funds a portion of the Athletic Fields Development project at Magnuson Park. The other portion of Phase 2 is the

 Sand Point Magnuson Park Wetlands Development project (K733133). The full athletic complex is proposed to include four full-size soccer, one rugby, two full-size baseball, two small baseball fields, some tennis courts and a few basketball courts. Total costs of the complex, including the Sports Meadow previously funded in project K73605, are approximately $40 million. An additional $30 million is required to complete the entire plan. The project includes a $25,000 allocation of 2002 NSF/CRF Neighborhood Program funding to design a NE 65th St.entrance to serve the fields.

 In the 2005 budget process, Council adopted a proviso that restricts spending any of the funding for construction of Phase 2 fields until authorized by a future ordinance. In 2006, upon the recommendation of the Pro Parks Oversight Committee, the Department transferred $883,275 (the remaining unallocated funds in the Playfields and Facilities Program) to this project from the Playfields and Facilities General Project (K733005). These additional funds will provide for improvements to one of the athletic fields which may include synthetic surface, lights and other amenities. Also, ~~I~~in 2006, the Department applied for two grants from the Washington State Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation (IAC), which are still pending. One grant of $300,000 would provide improved amenities to support the athletic fields. The second grant of $500,000 would construct a pedestrian access trail from Sand Point Way to Sportsfield Drive. If this grant is awarded, the City's matching funds will come from both the Athletic Field Renovation Project and the Wetlands

 Development Project (K733133).

 Project Type: Improved Facility Start Date: 1st Quarter 2002

 Project ID: K733134 End Date: TBD

 Location: 1000 Valley St.

 Neighborhood Plan: South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan Multiple

 Neighborhood District: Lake Union Urban South Lake Union

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, redevelops a 12-acre park at South Lake Union. The park master plan, adopted in July 2000, provides the basis for the use of $5 million in 2000 Parks Levy funding and other funds that may be raised over the next several years. The primary goal of the levy funding is to create an overall park plan which can be constructed in phases, and enhances the recreation and lake-front access functions of the park.

 The project will be constructed in two phases. Phase I includes constructing terraces, a boardwalk, and a pedestrian bridge, replacing the existing bulkhead, and installing utilities. Phase II includes constructing a new pedestrian and vehicle entry on Valley Street, building a centerpiece fountain, installing a "great lawn" and model boat pond, and adding landscaping throughout the park.

 The Seattle Parks Foundation is raising funds to support the continuing development of South Lake Union Park. In 2005, the Department entered into an Agreement with the Seattle Parks Foundation regarding their roles in fundraising, design, development, construction operation, and maintenance of the park (Ordinance 121963).

 Subsequent to this, the Department received a $5 million grant from a private donor, City Investors, via the Seattle Parks Foundation. City Investors has also committed to donating another $5 million to this project, contingent in part on the Foundation and the City raising an additional $10 million in donations (Ordinance 121902). In 2005, the Department also received an Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation (IAC) grant of $190,000, which was appropriated in the second quarter 2005 supplemental budget legislation (Ordinance 121883). In 2006, the Department applied for a second IAC grant of $500,000, which is still pending.

 In 2006, the Department determined that the existing north and west bulkhead walls were near the end of their useful lifespan, and that the most effective solution was to provide a permanent (50 year life) replacement of the walls. The additional cost of this work was estimated to be $4.23 million. Ordinance 122085 provided the additional funding through new appropriation and budget transfers from existing projects. Ordinance 122085 also restricted use of this appropriation, as well as $634,000 from prior appropriation, solely for the bulkhead replacement. As a result of the City's contribution of additional funding to this project, the agreement with the Seattle Parks Foundation previously authorized by Ordinance 121963 was amended through Ordinance 122084. In late summer 2006, the Department received construction bids that were higher than anticipated. Upon the recommendation of the Pro Parks Oversight Committee, the Department allocated an additional $300,000 in Pro Parks Levy funds to cover these additional costs. These funds will be appropriated in the fourth quarter 2006 supplemental budget legislation. Operations and maintenance costs associated with 2000 Parks Levy projects will be funded out of levy proceeds through 2008.

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, funds further planning and implementation of improvements identified in the Arboretum master plan, "Renewing the Washington Park Arboretum." Potential elements include pathway improvements, shoreline improvements, major landscaping, and improvements to the Japanese Garden. The Department, the University of Washington, and the Arboretum Foundation have developed an implementation plan

 that identifies phasing and funding responsibilities. The project is proceeding with three high-priority projects being funded with 2000 Parks Levy funds: improvements to the South Entry/Madrona Terrace (renamed Pacific Connections) project; the schematic design of a new entry structure at the Japanese Garden; and the design and construction of a new irrigation mainline system. The Foundation has raised sufficient funds to move the Terrace project into the design development phase and anticipates raising sufficient funds for a first phase of construction.

 The Japanese Garden Advisory Council is working with donors to fund final design and construction of the entry.

 Completion of the irrigation mainlines and the entry is expected in 2007. In 2006, ~~$210,000~~$339,072 was added to cover inflation and other costs associated with the named Neighborhood Park Development projects. Operations and maintenance costs associated with 2000 Parks levy projects are to be funded out of levy proceeds through 2008.
