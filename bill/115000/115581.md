The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, perform and administer a contract for loan guarantee assistance with HUD (the "Contract"), based on the form attached as Exhibit F to this ordinance, and with such additions, modifications and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, at the request of HUD, to execute and deliver an amendment to, or replacement for, the Contract in such form as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. The Contract, and any replacement contract, shall state in substance that the note issued by the City pursuant to Section 2 of this Ordinance shall be a non-recourse note, that the City's liability on the Note and the Contract shall be limited solely to the security pledged therefor, that they are not obligations of the City or the State of Washington, that neither the Note nor the Contract shall constitute a debt payable from the City's public funds, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the City shall be pledged for the City's obligations under the Contract or for payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, on the Note.

 Section 2. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, to issue a non-recourse promissory note in the principal amount not to exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), or multiple notes in a total principal amount not exceeding that sum (such note or notes are referred to as the "Note"), based on the form attached as Exhibit C to this ordinance, and with such modifications, additions or amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The interest rates for the Note shall be as determined in accordance with the terms of the Note and Contract. The Note shall provide for a schedule of maturities of principal approximately as stated in Exhibit B, with such modifications and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance, provided that no principal shall mature after 2027 and that the total amount of principal maturing in any year shall not be increased by more than 20% without approval by ordinance. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to cause portions of the proceeds of the Note to be disbursed, by the financial institution acting as Custodian pursuant to Section 6 of this Ordinance, to the order of 621 King LLC, a Washington limited liability company, and 507 Maynard LLC, a Washington limited liability company (these entities are referred to collectively as "Koh Entities"), or any substitute entities approved by the Mayor or OED Director, pursuant to the Loan Agreement authorized in Section 3 of this Ordinance, to assist in the financing of the acquisition, after redevelopment, of properties known as the Alps Hotel (621 S.

The initial project involving these two properties is described in the Project Description attached as Attachment B to Exhibit D. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to cause the remaining portion of the proceeds of the Note to be disbursed by the Custodian to the order of any additional borrowers pursuant to any further loan agreements for the use of Note proceeds that are approved by the City Council by any subsequent ordinance. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, at the request of HUD, to execute and deliver one or more replacement non-recourse promissory notes ("Replacement Note") in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), with substantially the same schedule of principal repayments and with interest rates determined substantially as contemplated by the Contract, and otherwise in such form as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Pursuant to RCW 35.21.735, the Note (including any Replacement Note) shall contain a recital to the effect that it is not an obligation of the City or the State of Washington, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State, the City or any other municipal corporation or subdivision of the State

 or any agency of any of the foregoing is pledged to the payment of principal, interest or premium if any, thereon.

 Section 3. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed a Loan Agreement with the Koh Entities, based on the form attached as Exhibit D, with such additions, modifications, and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance, together with such ancillary and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Such modifications may include, without limitation, separation of the financing to the Koh Entities into two loans, provided that both loans are secured by the same collateral and guaranty. The loan or loans to the Koh Entities shall be secured by one or more deeds of trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED Director, against the property being acquired with such loan or loans. The loan or loans to the Koh Entities shall also be secured by an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance from Koh family trust, known as ABCD Trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED Director. The Koh Entities and any other borrowers to which loans of Note proceeds shall be approved by any later ordinance are collectively referred to as "Obligors."

 Section 4. The specific terms of the loan or loans to the Koh Entities, and the use of the BEDI Grant for the Koh Entities, shall be based on the terms outlined in Attachment B to Exhibit D, with such adjustments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. In case of any inconsistency, the terms in Attachment B to Exhibit D shall control.

 Section 5. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City, to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with a financial institution to act as trustee and/or custodian (the "Custodian") to receive and disburse the proceeds of the City's non- recourse Note and to receive, administer and expend such funds as are received from Obligors as repayments or other payments under the Loan Agreements or from realization on the security for the loans. Such agreement shall also authorize the Custodian to receive and disburse BEDI Grant funds to defray in part the debt service obligations of the Obligors, over the term of the Contract, as support for the activities funded from the Note proceeds. Such agreement shall also include establishment by the Custodian of one or more special funds or accounts from which the City's Note shall be repaid, and any other funds or accounts that HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or appropriate. Such funds or accounts shall at all times be kept segregated and set apart from all funds and accounts of the City, and into such funds or accounts shall be deposited all money that is pledged as security to HUD in connection with the guaranty that is required under the HUD Contract to be deposited therein. The agreement(s) with the Custodian and all funds or accounts established thereunder shall comply with RCW 35.21.735.

 Section 6. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized to cause BEDI Grant funds to be drawn from the federal treasury and deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, No. 17820, companion BEDI Grant funds in the amount of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), and to cause the disbursement of up to such amount, and any interest earned thereon, to reduce debt service obligations on such loans, provide loan loss reserve and to finance project costs associated with loans funded with Note proceeds. BEDI Grant funds shall be apportioned pro rata among the loans based on the ratio of the maximum amount of each loan to the total Note proceeds (i.e., $10,000,000).

 Section 7. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized to negotiate and execute such additional agreements as the Mayor or OED Director deems necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance and to implement the Section 108 loan guaranty. The agreement(s) with the Custodian and the additional agreements authorized by this Section 7 shall be in the form and contain such terms and conditions as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance.

The Mayor or OED Director may enter into a fiscal agency agreement, for and on behalf of the City, under which JP Morgan Chase, or such other financial institution as may be designated by HUD, shall serve as fiscal agent with respect to the Note, on such terms and conditions as the Mayor or OED Director shall determine are necessary or appropriate to implement the purposes of this Ordinance. The authority granted in this Section shall apply notwithstanding Seattle Municipal Code subsection 5.10.060, to the extent it might be deemed applicable to the Note. The Fiscal Agent may be the same as the Custodian, or an affiliated entity thereof.

 Section 9. The Mayor or OED Director may require Obligors to pay a loan origination fee of up to 2% of the loan amounts. Such fee shall be paid directly to the Custodian to be held in trust for the purposes set forth in this Section 9. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of this fee to be disbursed by the Custodian to pay the National Development Council for consulting services related to the loans authorized hereby, in accordance with the City's existing contract with the National Development Council, and to pay for the City's legal fees and any other costs related to the issuance and placement of the Note and the administration of the transactions authorized by this Ordinance, that are not paid by Obligors pursuant to loan agreements. The OED Director is authorized to cause (i) any remaining portion of such fee and (ii) any payments received by the Custodian representing any difference between the interest rates charged to Obligors and the lower rates applicable to the Note or representing a periodic monitoring fee or similar fee, to be applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally guaranteed or federally funded economic development loan or program administered by the OED Director or to be remitted to the City and deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund.

 I. Terms Applicable Before the Conversion Date

 A. Advances

 For value received, the undersigned, the City of Seattle (the "Borrower", which term includes any successors and assigns), a public entity organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington promises to pay to the Registered Holder (the "Holder," which term includes any successors or assigns), at the time, in the manner, and with interest at the rate or rates hereinafter provided, such amounts as may be advanced under this Note from time to time by the Holder for disbursement to, or on behalf of, the Borrower (individually, an "Advance", and collectively, "Advances"). The Holder shall make Advances upon the written request of the Borrower and the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his designee (the "Secretary"), pursuant to the Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance (as further defined in Section IV.A. of this Note, the "Contract"), and the Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement (the "Fiscal Agency Agreement") dated as of May 17, 2000, between The Chase Manhattan Bank (now known as JPMorgan Chase Bank), as Fiscal Agent (the "Fiscal Agent"), and the Secretary. The total amount of Advances made for each Principal Due Date under this Note shall not exceed the applicable Commitment Amount for such Principal Due Date set forth on the Commitment Schedule attached hereto. The aggregate of all Advances under this Note for all Principal Due Dates shall not exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount specified on the attached Commitment Schedule. The Fiscal Agent shall record the date and amount of all payments and Advances on this Note and maintain the books and records of all such Advances and Commitment Amounts for each corresponding Principal Due Date, and all payments. No Advances shall be made on this Note after its Conversion Date.

 As used herein, "Conversion Date" means the date (if any) upon which this Note is (i) delivered by the Holder to the Fiscal Agent against payment therefore by the purchasers selected by the Secretary to make such payment; and (ii) assigned to JPMorgan Chase Bank (or any successor thereto) acting in its capacity as Trustee (the "Trustee") pursuant to a Trust Agreement between the Secretary and the Trustee, dated as of January 1, 1995, as such agreement may be amended or supplemented (the "Trust Agreement"). Upon the occurrence of both (i) and (ii) in the previous sentence, Section III of this Note applies, thereby converting this Note to a fixed rate obligation.

 B. Variable Rate of Interest

 From and including the date of each Advance to but excluding the earlier of (i) the Conversion Date, and (ii) the date of redemption or prepayment of such Advance pursuant to Section I.D. below (each such date of redemption or prepayment, a "Prepayment Date") interest shall be paid quarterly at a variable interest rate (as set forth below) on the unpaid principal balance of each Advance on the first day of each February, May, August and November (each, an "Interim Payment Date"), commencing on the first Interim Payment Date after the initial Advance is made under this Note. Interest also shall be paid on each applicable Conversion Date, Prepayment Date or Principal Due Date. The amount of interest payable on each Interim Payment Date will represent interest accrued during the three-month period ending immediately prior to such Interim Payment Date, or in the case of the first Interim Payment Date following each Advance that is not made on an Interim Payment Date, the period from and including the date of such Advance to but excluding the first Interim Payment Date following such Advance. The amount of interest payable on this Note's Conversion Date, Prepayment Date, or on any Principal Due Date that precedes such Conversion Date will represent interest accrued during the period from the last Interim Payment Date to such Conversion Date, Prepayment Date, or Principal Due Date, respectively.

 The initial variable interest rate for each Advance will be set on the date of such Advance and will be equal to 20 basis points (0.2%) above the Applicable LIBO Rate (as hereinafter defined) and thereafter will be adjusted monthly on the first day of each month (each, a "Reset Date") to a variable interest rate equal to 20 basis points (0.2%) above the Applicable LIBO Rate (such interest rate, as reset from time to time, the "Standard Note Rate"). If the Conversion Date for this Note has not occurred by the March 1 following the initial Advance under this Note, then the terms of Appendix A shall be used to set the variable interest rate. If the Fiscal Agent does not receive notice of either a Negotiated Special Interest Rate or Holder Determined Special Interest Rate (as defined in Appendix A attached hereto) from the Secretary or Holder, respectively, by the times specified in Appendix A to this Note, then the Standard Note Rate shall apply for the period to which such Negotiated Special Interest Rate or Holder Determined Special Interest Rate would otherwise apply. The Fiscal Agent may conclusively rely on any such notice as to the correctness of any matters set forth therein. Appendix A shall be inapplicable to this Note on or after the Conversion Date.

 "LIBO Rate" for any given Business Day means, except in the case of manifest error, the interest rate per annum published on that day in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal or any successor publication ("WSJ"), published by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., in the section titled "Money Rates" (or any successor section) and opposite the caption "London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) -- three months" (or any successor caption). If such rate does not appear in WSJ on a given Business Day, for each interest period, the LIBO Rate shall be the interest rate, converted to a bond-equivalent yield basis, for deposits in U.S. dollars for three months which appears on Telerate Page 3750 or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying such rate (together, "Telerate Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the day (the "Determination Date") that is two London Banking Days preceding the relevant Reset Date or Advance. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 on such Determination Date, such rate shall be obtained from the Reuters Screen ISDA Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date. If, in turn, such rate does not appear on the Reuters Screen ISDA Page on such Determination Date, the offered quotation from each of four reference banks (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date for deposits in U.S. dollars to prime banks on the London interbank market for a 3-month period, commencing on the Reset Date or date of such Advance, shall be obtained. If at least two such quotations are provided, the LIBO Rate for such Reset Date or date of such Advance will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, rounded to five decimal places. If fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, the LIBO Rate for that Determination Date shall be the rate for the most recent day preceding such Determination Date for which the LIBO Rate shall have been displayed on Telerate Page 3750. The LIBO Rate for any interest period shall be converted to a bond- equivalent yield basis by multiplying such rate by the actual number of days in such interest period and dividing that number by 180.

 "Applicable LIBO Rate" means: (1) with respect to the initial interest rate for the first Advance hereunder, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before the date of such first Advance; (2) with respect to the initial interest rate for any subsequent Advance made before the first Reset Date, the interest rate borne by the first Advance; (3) with respect to the initial interest rate for any subsequent Advance made after the first Reset Date, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before the immediately preceding Reset Date; and (4) with respect to the subsequent interest rate at any Reset Date for any Advance, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before such Reset Date.

 "London Banking Day" means any day in which dealings in deposits in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days lapsed.

 C. Principal Amount

 Prior to the Conversion Date, the aggregate amount of Advances under this Note for each specified Principal Due Date shall be the Principal Amount paid by the Borrower on such Principal Due Date (as assigned to such Advances by the Secretary's instructions to the Fiscal Agent in accordance with the Contract and the Fiscal Agency Agreement), except to the extent such Principal Amount shall have been reduced by redemption before such Principal Due Date as provided below.

 D. Redemption before Conversion Date

 At any time on or before the Conversion Date, the Borrower, with the consent of the Secretary, may redeem this Note, in whole or in part, upon fourteen calendar days notice to the Fiscal Agent and the Secretary, at the purchase price of one hundred percent (100%) of the unpaid Principal Amount to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Partial redemptions shall be credited against the applicable Principal Amount(s). The related Commitment Amounts and the Maximum Commitment Amount shall be adjusted concurrently with any such redemptions in accordance with the Secretary's instructions to the Fiscal Agent pursuant to the Contract and the Fiscal Agency Agreement.

 II. Conversion

 The following events shall occur on the Conversion Date:

 A. Schedule P&I

 On the Conversion Date all Advances owed by the Borrower under this Note with the same Principal Due Date shall be aggregated into a single Principal Amount which will accrue interest at the fixed rate applicable to such Principal Due Date. Such Principal Amount may be adjusted by the Fiscal Agent in accordance with the following paragraph or paragraph IV.H, as applicable. Whether or not adjusted, each Principal Amount, the fixed rate applicable to each Principal Amount, and the applicable Principal Due Date, shall be listed by the

 Secretary in Schedule P&I. Schedule P&I will be provided by the Secretary to the Fiscal Agent and attached to this Note by the Fiscal Agent upon the Fiscal Agent's receipt of this Note on the Conversion Date.

 B. Conversion Date Advances

 If, on or prior to the Conversion Date, the Borrower has not utilized the entire Commitment Amount indicated on the Commitment Schedule attached hereto for a given Principal Due Date, the Borrower may, in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Contract, and with the approval of the Secretary, utilize such Commitment Amount on the Conversion Date to obtain a Conversion Date Advance. A "Conversion Date Advance" shall mean any amount by which the Secretary instructs the Fiscal Agent to increase a Principal Amount on Schedule P&I for a given Principal Due Date, effective as of the Conversion Date of this Note. Conversion Date Advances shall be funded by the sale of this Note to the purchaser selected by the Secretary. The proceeds of a Conversion Date Advance (net of any applicable fees) shall be distributed to or on behalf of the Borrower on the Conversion Date. The total amount of Conversion Date Advances hereunder shall not exceed the sum of any unused Commitment Amounts for all Principal Due Dates.

 III. Terms Applicable Upon Conversion

 The following terms shall apply to this Note from the Conversion Date (if any) until this Note is canceled, or matured and

 paid in full:

 Commencing on the Conversion Date, the Borrower promises to pay to the Holder on the applicable Principal Due Date each Principal Amount set forth on the attached Schedule P&I, together with interest on each such Principal Amount at the rate applicable thereto specified on the Schedule P&I. Interest shall be calculated and payments shall be made in the manner set forth below.

 Interest on each scheduled Principal Amount of this Note due as of a given date specified on Schedule P&I hereto shall accrue at the related per annum rate specified on Schedule P&I from (and including) the Conversion Date to (but excluding) such Principal Due Date or, if applicable, to the applicable Interest Due Date on which an Optional Redemption (as defined below) occurs. Each interest amount accrued on each unpaid Principal Amount of this Note shall be due semiannually as of February 1 and August 1 of each year (each such February 1 and August 1, an "Interest Due Date") commencing on the first such date after the Conversion Date, until each Principal Amount listed on Schedule P&I to this Note is paid in full. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 Certain Principal Amounts that are indicated as being eligible for Optional Redemption on Schedule P&I may be paid, in whole or in part, at the option of the Borrower as of any Interest Due Date on or after the date specified in such schedule (an "Optional Redemption"). In order to elect an Optional Redemption of such a Principal Amount, the Borrower shall give notice of its intention to prepay a Principal Amount to the Trustee and the Secretary not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days prior to the Interest Due Date as of which the Borrower intends to prepay the Principal Amount. The Trustee shall apply any payments received in respect of Optional Redemptions in accordance with written instructions of the Borrower, as approved by the Secretary. Principal Amounts that are not indicated as being eligible for Optional Redemption on Schedule P&I may not be prepaid.

 If a payment of principal or interest herein provided for shall not be made by either (i) 2:30 p.m. on an Interest Due Date or Principal Due Date; or (ii) 2:30 p.m. on the second Business Day (as herein defined) next succeeding an Interim Payment Date, then interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment at the then applicable interest rate or rates payable on this Note, from the relevant due date, as the case may be, until the date such payment is made. Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall be construed as permitting or implying that the Borrower may, without the written consent of the Holder and the Secretary, modify, extend, alter or affect in any manner whatsoever the right of the Holder timely to receive any and all payments of principal and interest specified in this Note.

 D. Applicability of Fiscal Agency Agreement or Trust Agreement

 Prior to the Conversion Date, this Note and Advances and payments made hereunder shall be administered pursuant to the terms of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and are subject to such agreement. On or after the Conversion Date, this Note and Advances and payments made hereunder shall be administered pursuant to the Trust Agreement and are subject to such agreement. The terms and provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Trust Agreement, insofar as they affect the rights, duties and obligations of the Holder and/or the Borrower, are hereby incorporated herein and form a part of this Note. The Borrower hereby agrees to be bound by all obligations of the Borrower to the Fiscal Agent set forth in the Fiscal Agency Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this Note shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Fiscal Agency Agreement or Trust Agreement, as applicable. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides for the Fiscal Agent to perform certain duties, including the duties of (i) paying agent and calculation agent for this Note until its Conversion Date, and (ii) registrar for this Note until this Note is canceled or a new registrar appointed, each in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Trust Agreement provides for the Trustee to perform certain duties, including the duties of collection agent for this Note after its Conversion Date until a new Trustee is appointed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. This Note may be surrendered to the Fiscal Agent for registration of transfer or exchange, as provided in the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Fiscal Agent and Trustee each shall permit reasonable inspection to be made of a copy of the Fiscal Agency Agreement or Trust Agreement kept on file at its respective corporate trust office. Neither the Fiscal Agency Agreement nor the Trust Agreement shall change the Borrower's payment obligations under this Note.

 E. Applicability of Contract and Secretary's Guarantee

 This Note evidences indebtedness incurred pursuant to and in accordance with the Contract and pursuant to Section 108 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 5308) (the "HCD Act"). This Note is subject to the terms and provisions of the Contract, to which Contract reference is hereby made for a statement of said terms and provisions and for a description of the collateral security for this Note. The payment of principal on the applicable Principal Due Dates and interest on the applicable Interim Payment Dates or Interest Due Dates under this Note is unconditionally guaranteed by the Secretary to the Holder through a guarantee (the "Guarantee"). Execution of the Secretary's Guarantee is required before this Note is effective, and such Guarantee shall be issued pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Contract and Section 108 of the HCD Act.

 F. Default

 A default under this Note shall occur upon failure by the Borrower to pay principal or interest on this Note when due hereunder. If a Borrower defaults on the payment of any interest or Principal Amounts when due, or if the Secretary gives notice of a final decision to declare the Borrower in default pursuant to the following paragraph of this Section IV.F, the Secretary may, but is not obligated to, make on any date on or prior to the Conversion Date with fourteen calendar days prior notice to the Fiscal Agent, or on the seventh Business Day preceding any Interest Due Date on or after the first permissible Optional Redemption date with seven Business Days prior notice to the Trustee, an acceleration payment to the Fiscal Agent or the Trustee, as applicable, equal to the Aggregate Principal Amount of the Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to such acceleration payment date or Interest Due Date, as applicable. In the event that any such acceleration payment is made from sources other than funds pledged by the Borrower as security under the Contract (or other Borrower funds), the amounts paid on behalf of the Borrower shall be deemed to be immediately due and payable to the Secretary. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as permitting or implying that the Borrower may, without the written consent of the Holder and the Secretary, modify, extend, alter or affect in any manner whatsoever the right of the Holder timely to receive any and all payments of principal and interest specified in this Note.

 In addition, the Secretary may declare the Borrower in default under this Note if the Secretary makes a final decision in accordance with the provisions of 24 C.F.R. section 570.913 (or any successor regulation thereof), including requirements for reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that the Borrower has failed to comply substantially with Title I of the HCD Act. Following the giving of such reasonable notice, the Secretary may take the remedial actions specified as available in the relevant provisions of the Contract pending the Secretary's final decision.

 G. Holder's Reliance on Guarantee

 Following a default by the Borrower under the terms of this Note, the Holder agrees to rely wholly and exclusively for repayment of this Note upon the Guarantee. The enforcement of any instruments or agreements securing or otherwise related to this Note shall be the sole responsibility of the Secretary, and the Holder shall not be responsible for the preparation, contents or administration of such instruments and agreements, or for any actions taken in connection with such instruments and agreement. The Holder, to the extent it is legally able to do so, shall bind or cause to be bound its successors and assigns to all limitations imposed upon the Holder by this Note.

 H. Amendment

 This Note may only be amended with the prior written consent of the Secretary and the Borrower. No such amendment shall reduce, without the prior written consent of the Holder of this Note, in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments required to be received on this Note by the Holder, Fiscal Agent or Trustee, including Guarantee Payments; provided that prior to the Conversion Date, the Commitment Amounts on the Commitment Schedule attached hereto, and the Principal Amounts due on the corresponding Principal Due Dates may be rescheduled pursuant to written instructions given to the Fiscal Agent by the Secretary with the written agreement of the Borrower and the Secretary absent the consent of the Holder.

 I. Waivers

 The Borrower hereby waives any requirement for presentment, protest or other demand or notice with respect to this Note. The Borrower hereby waives notice of default and opportunity for hearing for any failure to make a payment when due.

 J. Delivery and Effective Date

 This Note is deemed issued, executed, and delivered on behalf of the Borrower by its authorized official as an obligation guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to Section 108 of the HCD Act, effective as of the date of the Secretary's Guarantee.

 V. Borrower-Specific Provisions

 APPENDIX A

 Special Pre-Conversion Interest Rates.

 (a) The Holder and the Secretary contemplate that the majority of the outstanding Variable/Fixed Rate Notes will be purchased by underwriters selected by the Secretary for sale in public offerings to occur each year. If a public offering including this Note has not occurred by each March 1 following the initial Advance under this Note, the Secretary shall, upon request, advise the Holder as to when a public offering including this Note is expected to occur, and the Holder and the Secretary agree to consult with each other as to what the interest rate on this Note will be after May 1 of that year if a public offering has not occurred by such May 1. The Holder shall notify the Secretary if such consultation has not occurred by April 1 of that year. If no public offering including this Note has occurred on or before such May 1, the applicable interest rate on this Note from such May 1 shall be the rate (if any) negotiated and agreed upon by the Secretary and the Holder. Such rate may be the Standard Note Rate or some other rate agreed upon by the Holder and the Secretary at least two Business Days before such May 1 (such other rate, the "Negotiated Special Interest Rate"). The Secretary shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Holder in writing of any Negotiated Special Interest Rate within two Business Days of the determination thereof.

 (b) If the Secretary and the Holder do not, by the April 15th preceding such May 1, negotiate and agree under Section (a) of this Appendix on an interest rate applicable to this Note, then the Holder may, on or before the April 20th preceding such May 1, give written notice to the Secretary of its intent to change the interest rate on this Note and, if such notice was given during such period, the Holder may, on such May 1, unilaterally determine (subject to the terms of this paragraph) the interest rate that this Note will bear (such rate, the "Holder Determined Interest Rate") from and including such May 1 to but excluding the earliest of: (i) the Conversion Date; (ii) the date that this Note is purchased by a new Holder (as described in Section (c) below) or (iii) a Monthly Special Reset Date (as defined below). Interest from and including such May 1 to but excluding the Public Offering Date shall be paid on the unpaid principal balance of all outstanding Advances under this Note at the rate(s) to be determined by the Holder which, based upon then prevailing market conditions and taking into account all the circumstances, will enable the Holder to sell this Note at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount of all Advances hereunder prior to the date of such sale. Such interest rate shall be determined as of such May 1 and shall be determined again on the foregoing basis on the first of each month thereafter (the first of each month after such May 1, a "Monthly Special Reset Date"). The Holder shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Secretary in writing within two Business Days following such dates of the determination of the Holder Determined Interest Rate and each applicable interest rate determined on a Monthly Special Reset Date.

 (c) If the Secretary and the Holder have failed to agree upon an interest rate pursuant to Section (a) of this Appendix A, the Secretary, upon seven calendar days notice to the Holder, may arrange for the purchase of this Note in full by another entity on the following May 1 or any Business Day thereafter. If such a purchase occurs, the Holder shall sell and assign this Note to the purchaser thereof without recourse to the Holder and deliver this Note and its Guarantee to the Fiscal Agent for registration in the name of the purchaser thereof in accordance with the Secretary's written instructions. The purchase price for this Note shall be 100% of the aggregate amount of all Advances owing hereunder plus accrued interest to the date of purchase. Payment to the Holder of the purchase price for this Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof in Federal funds at the offices of the Holder, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Holder and the Secretary, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of purchase. After such purchase date this Note shall bear a rate of interest negotiated between the Secretary and the new interim Holder (the "New Purchaser Special Interest Rate"). The Secretary shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the new purchaser in writing of any New Purchaser Special Interest Rate within two Business Days following the date of determination thereof.

 (d) Notwithstanding Sections (a) through (c) (inclusive) of this Appendix, no Borrower is obligated to pay interest at a variable rate exceeding the maximum rate permitted by generally applicable law of the Borrower's state (such rate, the "Maximum Rate"). If the Borrower receives notice of a variable interest payment that exceeds the Maximum Rate, then the Borrower shall timely pay such amount as does not exceed the Maximum Rate, and concurrently shall notify the Secretary and the Fiscal Agent of the reason for any interest non- payment.

 LOAN AGREEMENT

 THIS LOAN AGREEMENT (as supplemented or amended from time to time, and including all documents and terms incorporated herein by reference, the "Agreement"), dated as of , is entered into by and between 621 King LLC, a Washington limited liability company and 507 Maynard LLC, a Washington limited liability company (hereinafter called "Obligor," which term shall refer to both such companies unless the context otherwise clearly requires) and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation (hereinafter called "City").

 RECITALS

 This Agreement is entered into upon the basis of the following facts and circumstances:

 A. Alps Hotel LLC and Hong Kong Building LLC ("Owners") are the current owners of real property described in Attachment A, attached hereto and made a part hereof by this reference (the "Property"), and they intend to cause the rehabilitation of the Property as described in Attachment B, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the rehabilitation of the Property, its acquisition by Obligor, and the implementation of the national objectives described in Attachment B, are referred to collectively as "the Project"). Following rehabilitation, the Owners will sell the Property to Obligor, both of which are Washington limited liability companies controlled by the Koh family. Obligor will use the proceeds of the Loan (described in Section 1.1 below) to purchase the Property.

 B. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") has agreed, subject to certain conditions, to guarantee a non-recourse note or notes (collectively, as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any replacements thereof issued by the City and guaranteed by HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract described below, the "City Note") issued by City in part to fund the Loan, in accordance with Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (such Act and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder are hereinafter collectively called the "Act"). As of the date hereof, the City Note is a Variable/Fixed Rate Note, no. in the maximum commitment amount of $10,000,000, which is the subject of a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance between the City and HUD dated (as it may be further supplemented or amended from time to time, the "HUD Contract") and certain Letter Agreements for Section 108 Guarantee Program Custodial Account (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Letter Agreements") among the City, HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (hereinafter referred to, with any successors under such agreement or successor agreement, and in its capacity as trustee in connection with the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, as "Custodian"). City has also entered into an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement with the Custodian (as supplemented or amended from time to time, together with any substitute therefor in accordance with Section 7.2 below, the "Custodial Agreement"), which provides for, among other things, the Custodian to hold certain security for the City Note on behalf of HUD and for the establishment and management of certain accounts pursuant to the HUD Contract and Letter Agreements. The HUD Contract is entered into pursuant to an application submitted to HUD by the City dated , a copy of which Obligor has received and reviewed (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Application"). The Application, HUD Contract, Letter Agreements and Custodial Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the HUD Contract or City Note, as applicable.

 C. The Office of Economic Development of the City ("OED") is responsible within The City of Seattle for making, subject to City Council approval, loans of funds obtained from HUD by pledges of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds to be made available to the City by HUD, pursuant to the Act. Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED. The Director of OED, or his or her duly authorized designee, and any official of the City succeeding to the functions of such Director, is referred to herein as the "OED Director."

 D. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by Obligor's Promissory Note ("Obligor Note") in the form attached hereto as Attachment C and hereby incorporated by reference, and together with Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, secured by Deeds of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing in the form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any other assignments of leases, tenant estoppels, subordination and attornment agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement, the "Deeds of Trust") on the Property, dated on or about the date hereof. The Obligor Note, this Agreement, the Deeds of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity (defined in Section 3.1 of this Agreement), and any other documents or instruments executed by Obligor in favor of City pursuant hereto, are collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents". Where the context so requires, to the extent that the Loan Documents provide that Obligor's obligations or duties thereunder are determined by reference to any terms or provisions of documents incorporated by reference in any of the Loan Documents, any reference to the "Loan Documents" shall include such terms or provisions.

 E. Obligor's obligations under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Certificate and Indemnity shall be unconditionally guaranteed under a Guaranty (defined in Section 1.4(b) of this Agreement), executed by the Koh family trust, known as the ABCD Trust (the "Guarantor") and delivered to the City as a material inducement to the City's agreement to make the Loan in accordance with this Agreement.

 F. The portion of principal on the City Note that is scheduled to become due and payable in any year, equal to that portion of principal on the Obligor Note scheduled to become due in the same year, is referred to as the "Corresponding Advance" to such portion of principal on the Obligor Note, and the aggregate of all Corresponding Advances is referred to as the "Corresponding Portion" of the City Note.

 G. The City will transfer funds in the maximum aggregate amount of Six Hundred Seventy Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars, derived solely from a Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant from HUD, to the Custodian, for deposit into a reserve account (the "BEDI Grant Reserve Account") to be established by the Custodian at Closing and held for the following purposes described in Section 7.16 below.

 NOTICE: ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the covenants, conditions, representations and warranties contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I - THE LOAN

 1.1 The Loan. In reliance upon Obligor's representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the HUD Contract, the Letter Agreements and the Custodial Agreement, the City hereby agrees to cause funds to be advanced to Obligor through the Custodian (which advances collectively shall constitute the "Loan") in a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to Three Million Three Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Dollars ($3,354,000), solely for the purposes set forth in Section 1.2 below. Loan disbursements shall be made only to the extent of available funds received by the Custodian for such purposes through issuance by the City of the City Note, and except with respect to the payment of interest from BEDI Grant funds allocated for such purpose as more particularly described in Section 4.6(b) of this Agreement and the Custodial Agreement, the City shall have no obligation to make disbursements to or for the benefit of Obligor for acquisition of the Property, payment of costs of the Project or otherwise, from any other source. Obligor shall have the right to receive Loan funds only pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Act.

 1.2 Purpose of Loan. Loan proceeds shall be used by Obligor

 solely for the costs of acquiring the Property and related financing costs in accordance with this Agreement.

 1.3 Loan Documentation; Payment of Principal and Interest; Covenant.

 (a) Loan Documentation. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by the Obligor Note, and together with Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, shall be secured by the Deeds of Trust. In addition, the Obligor shall grant at loan closing a recorded set of covenants in favor of the City (the "Covenant," which may consist of separate instruments for each parcel of the Property) regarding the use of the Property, committing to maintain low-income housing at affordable rents to the extent described in Section 5.7(a) below and in Attachment B to this Loan Agreement, requiring that the Property maintained consistent with City housing standards and historic preservation standards, and containing such other provisions as the City shall require.

 (b) Principal and Interest. The principal of and interest on this Loan shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms set forth in the Obligor Note.

 1.4 Security.

 (a) Deeds of Trust. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents at all times shall be secured by the Deeds of Trust, which shall be liens on the Property and security interest in all personal property associated with the Property, subject only to encumbrances permitted in accordance with Sections 2.4 and 7.16 below, and subject to any other encumbrances, modifications, partial releases or substitutions of security that the OED Director may authorize in writing, in the discretion of the OED Director. The liens and security interests granted pursuant to the Deeds of Trust shall be perfected, to the extent possible, by recording in the real property records of King County, Washington, and by filing with the Department of Licensing of the State of Washington, and Obligor agrees to take all action reasonably requested by the City or Custodian, and to pay all fees and costs reasonably required to continue such perfection so long as the Loan or any of Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents remain outstanding. The Deeds of Trust shall include an assignment of leases and rents; however, upon request by the City, the Obligor agrees to obtain, execute and deliver such additional assignments of leases, and consents to assignment and subordination and attornment agreements from tenants of the Property as the City may reasonably request prior or subsequent to Closing (defined in Section 4.1 of this Agreement). Obligor understands and agrees that City may assign the Deeds of Trust to HUD as security for HUD's rights in connection with its guarantee of the City Note.

 (b) Unconditional Guaranty. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents and the Certificate and Indemnity, at all times shall be secured by an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Guaranty") from the Guarantor, in form and content acceptable to the City. Obligor represents and warrants that the Guarantor has an interest in each Obligor and that the trustees thereof have full power and authority to make and perform the Guaranty on behalf of the Guarantor.

 (c) Reserve Accounts. Obligor's obligations under the Loan

 Documents also shall be secured by all funds and investments in all of the accounts now or hereafter established under the Loan Documents, including without limitation, the Custodial Agreement, relating to the Obligor and specifically including without limitation, the respective subaccounts related to the Obligor Note in the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account, the Guaranteed Loan Funds Investment Account, the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account, and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account (all such accounts are collectively referred to herein as the "Reserve Accounts," and to the extent that the Custodian maintains any account for the purpose of more than one loan, all references to any such account, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, shall refer to the subaccount thereof related to the Obligor Note). Obligor hereby pledges to the City, and grants the City a security interest in, all right, title and interest of Obligor, if any, in and to the funds and investments now or hereafter in the Reserve Accounts, and all earnings thereon and proceeds thereof.

The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to transfer from the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the Loan Repayment Account on each Obligor Note Payment Date, funds in the full amount due on the Obligor Note on each such date, and so long as no Interest Component is required from the Obligor, to transfer from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, the amount of the Interest Component that would be required from the Obligor but for the terms of Section 4.6(b). The Custodian is then authorized and directed to apply funds in the Loan Repayment Account to the timely payment of amounts due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Obligor further agrees that upon direction of the City, the Custodian may apply funds in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to make any payments on the Corresponding Portion for which there are insufficient funds in the Loan Repayment Account as a result of failure by Obligor to pay funds to the Custodian for deposit therein as required hereunder, but no application of any funds in any account to payments on the Obligor Note shall waive or reduce any such required payments from Obligor. Obligor's monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account shall not constitute payments under the Obligor Note. Obligor shall be credited with the payment of interest and principal on the Obligor Note only when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit and/or transferred to the Loan Repayment Account under this Section 4.6(c), not including any amounts in the Loan Loss Reserve, are applied to the payment of the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, except that if all amounts necessary to pay all amounts owing on the Obligor Note are on deposit in the Loan Repayment Account on the final maturity date of the Obligor Note, such amounts shall be credited on such maturity date. The Custodian is further irrevocably authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments in the Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account, in the Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any loss on any such liquidation, for the purposes described in this Section 4.6(c). The authorization by Obligor in this Section 4.6(c) is in addition to, and not in limitation of, the authorization in Section 1.4 above.

 (d) Investment of Funds; Earnings Remain on Deposit. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall be invested at the direction of City, but only in instruments that mature (or are redeemable without penalty) within six (6) months and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days before the next Obligor Note Payment Date, and that are guaranteed as to payment of principal by the United States Government, or in money market funds that invest solely in such instruments. All earnings in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall remain therein until applied in accordance with this Agreement, or until all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, or in the case of the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, until any earlier date when any right of the Obligor to have amounts in such Account applied for its benefit shall have terminated hereunder. When all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, then the remaining balance shall be disbursed to or upon the order of the City.

 (e) Late Charge. If any deposit required to be made into the Loan Repayment Account is not received within ten (10) days after the date when such deposit is due, in addition to additional interest required to be paid in accordance with the Obligor Note, Obligor agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5.0%) of the amount past due, as compensation to the City and Custodian for the staff time and resources required to handle such delinquencies, and not as a penalty. Such late charges shall not be credited to the Loan Repayment Account, but shall be retained by the City and/or Custodian. Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.

 4.7 Application of Payments. Any amounts to be applied to the Obligor Note in accordance with this Agreement shall be applied first to accrued interest on the Obligor Note, next to any premium then due, and the balance, if any, to reduction of principal.

 ARTICLE V - OBLIGOR'S LOAN COVENANTS

 In addition to other obligations of the Obligor hereunder, Obligor covenants and agrees as follows:

 5.1 General. From and after the date hereof and so long as any amount remains unpaid on the Obligor Note, or for so long as any commitment exists to extend credit hereunder, Obligor covenants and agrees that it will:

 (a) Promptly pay principal, interest and premium (if any) pursuant to the Obligor Note as and when the same becomes due and payable, and make any and all other payments and deposits required by the Loan Documents;

 (b) Preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence as

 limited liability companies under the laws of the State of Washington;

 (c) Maintain, preserve and keep the Property, improvements thereon, and all equipment used in connection therewith in good repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and from time to time make all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements and additions thereto so that at all times the efficiency thereof shall be fully preserved and maintained.

 5.2 Commencement and Completion of Rehabilitation. Permanent certificates of occupancy for all space in the rehabilitated buildings on the Property shall be obtained no later than January 15, 2007.

 5.3 Compliance with Laws. All use and operation of the Property and Project, and all work performed in connection with the Property and Project shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and executive orders of federal, state, county or municipal governments or agencies now in force or which may be enacted hereafter.

 5.4 Inspections. City and its representatives shall have the right, subject to the rights of tenants on the Property, at all reasonable times after three (3) days' prior written notice during regular business hours (and at any time in the event of an emergency) to enter upon the Property and inspect the Property to determine that the same is in conformity with this Agreement and all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. City shall have the further right, from time to time, to inspect and copy Obligor's books and records relating to the Property. Without limiting the foregoing, Obligor shall permit City to examine and copy all books, records and other papers relating to Obligor's use of the Loan proceeds and to

 Obligor's compliance with this Agreement, the Act and applicable provisions of federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

 5.5 Notify City of Litigation or Complaints. Obligor shall promptly notify City in writing of all litigation or threatened litigation involving the Property or any part of the Property, and any other litigation that reasonably could have a material adverse affect on the financial condition of Obligor, and of all complaints or charges made by any governmental authority affecting the Property or Obligor which may require changes in the development or use of the Property.

 5.6 Waiver of Immunity.

 Obligor waives, after mutual negotiation, and with respect to the City only, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance.

 Initials: Obligor: ____ City: _____

 5.7 Federal Regulations. Obligor acknowledges that the Loan is to be made with funds received by the Custodian under the Section 108 program of the Act and that such funds are subject to CDBG program regulations of HUD, and certain other federal laws and regulations. Accordingly, Obligor agrees, represents and warrants that Obligor shall comply with all applicable requirements under HUD regulations for the CDBG program and under other laws and regulations applicable to loans of such federal funds, including without limitation those cited in this Section 5.7, and shall comply with all of the provisions below, some of which extend beyond federal requirements:

 (a) Benefit to Low- and Moderate Income Individuals. Loan funds shall be used for acquisition, after rehabilitation, of the Property. Use of funds shall satisfy the CDBG national objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income individuals (as defined by HUD for CDBG purposes) and the eligible activity criteria of acquisition under 24 CFR 570.703(a).

 For a ten (10) year period following the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the residential units of the Project shall be rented to and occupied by households with incomes at or below seventy (70%) percent of Median Income at rents affordable to households with incomes at 70% of Median Income. Rents shall be considered affordable to such households if the total monthly rent, plus a reasonable allowance approved by the City for any utilities to be paid by the tenant, does not exceed one-twelfth of thirty percent (30%) of 70% of Median Income for a presumed family size based on the size of unit, as follows: studio --one person; one-bedroom, 1.5 persons; two bedrooms 3 persons; three bedrooms 4.5 persons; four bedrooms 6 persons. Where the presumed family size is not an integer, the average of the income limits for the next higher and lower integral family sizes will be used. Obligor shall use the definition of annual income set forth in subsection (1) (i) in the definition of "income" under 24 CFR 570.3. "Median Income" means annual median family income, as published from time to time by HUD, for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, or for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Division of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area, whichever is then generally used by HUD to establish income limits for federal programs, or such other area including Seattle as HUD may use from time to time for the purpose of publishing median income, and as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing. If, at any time, Median Income for a household size cannot be determined under the foregoing sentence based on data published by HUD for the Seattle area within the most recent thirteen months, then the City may determine "Median Income" for such household size based on any data for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion, adjusted for household size in such manner as the City shall determine in its sole discretion.

 Notwithstanding the paragraph above, rents for the Project's residential units shall be further restricted for Existing Tenants. For purposes of this section, "Existing Tenants" shall be defined as those residential tenants occupying units of the Project as of the date of execution of this Agreement. Obligor shall deliver a complete list of Existing Tenants to the City with their household sizes and income levels. For the initial two (2) years of the Loan term, Existing Tenants shall not pay rents in excess of rents affordable to households with incomes at 30% of Median Income. For the third, fourth and fifth (3-5) years of the Loan term, Existing Tenants shall not pay rents in excess of rents affordable to households earning at 40% Median Income. For the sixth through tenth years of the Loan term, Existing Tenants shall not pay rents in excess of rents affordable to households earning at 50% Median Income.

 The Project shall also result in the creation of at least thirty- five (35) new permanent jobs (full-time equivalent) at the Property. The Project is located in a census block group having a poverty rate of at least 20% and is not located within the City's central business district. As such, all jobs created for the Project will be presumed to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, pursuant to Section 570.208(a)(4)(iv) and (v).

 (b) Nondiscrimination. No person shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with CDBG funds. Obligor shall comply fully with all requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq., which provides that no person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; and with Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") regulations implementing such requirements, 24 C.F.R. Part 1.

 Obligor shall comply with all of the requirements and prohibitions of 24 C.F.R. Section 570.602, implementing the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended; those of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations at 28 C.F.R. Parts 35 and 36 thereunder; those of HUD regulations under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. Section 6101 et seq., at 24 C.F.R. Part 146; and those of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Section 794), and implementing regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 8. Obligor shall include, in any instrument effecting or recording any transfer of its interest in the Property, the covenant required by 24 C.F.R. Section 8.50 with regard to compliance with regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

 Obligor shall ensure compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled "Equal Opportunity", as amended, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, 41 C.F.R. Part 60, which provide that no person shall be discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in all phases of employment during the performance of federal contracts and subcontracts, and Obligor shall take affirmative action to ensure fair treatment in employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation and selection for training or apprenticeship. The "equal opportunity clause" set forth in 41 C.F.R. Section 60-1.4(a) is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth, with Obligor as "Contractor" thereunder. Obligor shall cause the appropriate "equal opportunity clause" to be set forth in each "federally assisted construction contract" (as defined in 41 CFR Section 60-1.3, including subcontracts) for the Project, except as expressly exempted under 41 C.F.R. Part 60.

 No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

 (c) Conflict of Interest. Obligor shall ensure compliance with the provisions of 24 CFR Section 570.611, which provide generally that no officer, agent, employee, consultant or elected or appointed official of The City of Seattle, or of a designated public agency, or of any subrecipient receiving CDBG funds, who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted by CDBG funds or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with respect to these activities, shall obtain any financial interest or benefit from, or have any financial interest in, the activity funded under this Loan Agreement or any contract or subcontract or agreement with respect thereto or the proceeds thereof, for himself or herself or those with whom he or she has business or immediate family ties; nor shall (s)he for one year after completion of his or her tenure with the City or such subrecipient obtain or have any such financial interest or benefit. Obligor shall incorporate in all such contracts or subcontracts a provision prohibiting any conflict of interest prohibited by this subsection.

 (d) Debarred Contractors. No portion of the Loan shall be used directly or indirectly to employ, award contracts to, or otherwise engage the services of, or fund, any contractor or subrecipient during any period of debarment, suspension, or placement in ineligibility status of such contractor or subrecipient under the provisions of 24 C.F.R. Part 24. Obligor represents and warrants that neither Obligor nor its principals is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in federal assistance programs under such regulations or Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension." Obligor shall obtain, and shall require contractors and subcontractors to obtain, the certification required by appendix B of 24 CFR part 24 from each prospective contractor or subcontractor on the Project.

 (e) Lobbying. Obligor hereby certifies and agrees as follows, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Section 1352, to the best of its knowledge and belief:

 (1) No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of Obligor, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant,

 loan, or cooperative agreement;

 (2) If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with this Federal loan, it will complete and submit Standard Form-LLL, "Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying," in accordance with its instructions; and

 (3) It will require that the language of this Section be included in the award documents for subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly.

 This certification is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was made or entered into. Submission of this certification is made a prerequisite for making or entering into this transaction by section 1352, title 31, U. S. Code. Any person who fails to file the required certification shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

 (f) Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Obligor shall comply with any and all applicable requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and related acts. These requirements include, but are not limited to: language within each contract for construction work; payment of prevailing wages and fringe benefits; the submittal of various documents as evidence of compliance; withholding of funds; equal employment opportunity; and work hours.

 The requirements are defined in the: Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 276(a) et seq.; Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 328 et seq.; Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback Act), 18 U.S.C. Section 874; the Fair Labor Standards Act, and regulations under such Acts, including 29 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 5. If under other applicable law or any other agreement with respect to the Project, minimum levels of wages or benefits are required, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with such levels, and if both Davis-Bacon Act requirements and any other such requirements shall apply, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with higher of the applicable levels.

 (g) Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons. Obligor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with any and all applicable provisions of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u, the purpose of which is to ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. Obligor shall comply, and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable provisions of regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Secretary of HUD and set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 135, and with all applicable rules and orders of HUD issued thereunder.

 (h) Relocation and Acquisition. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that no residential tenants have been or will be displaced in connection with the Project and the Obligor has taken and shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) in connection with the Project. If the Obligor or its affiliate has acquired or entered into an agreement to acquire real property for the Project, then Obligor represents and warrants that prior to making an offer for such property, (1) Obligor or such affiliate clearly advised the owner in writing that it lacked the power of eminent domain and therefore was unable to acquire the property in the event negotiations failed to reach an amicable agreement, and (2) it informed the owner in writing of what Obligor or such affiliate believed to be the fair market value of the property. Obligor represents and warrants that Obligor has provided to City a complete and accurate list of all occupants of the Property as of the date that Obligor obtained site control, and Obligor shall provide a complete and accurate list of all persons occupying the Property at any time after site control and through the date of full occupancy after Project completion. Obligor shall comply fully, at Obligor's sole expense, with the City's Residential Anti-displacement and Relocation Assistance Plan ("RARAP"). If the Project involves the temporary and/or permanent displacement of persons, Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that Obligor has provided and shall provide, at a minimum, all relocation assistance required by 24 CFR Section 42; the federal Uniform Relocation Act and regulations thereunder, 49 CFR Part 24; 24 CFR Section 570.606 and any other applicable federal laws or regulations, and shall maintain complete and accurate records demonstrating such compliance. Obligor agrees that any determination by City of the amount of relocation assistance due to any person shall be final and binding upon Obligor, unless a different determination is made by HUD at the request of such person, in which case the HUD determination shall be final and binding on Obligor. Obligor agrees that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any payment by the City for such person shall, at City's option, constitute an advance on the Loan, without any requirement for a draw request by, or consent of, Obligor. If, as a result of any such direct payments, the amount advanced by City shall exceed the maximum Loan amount stated herein, then the excess shall be immediately due and payable by Obligor to City, at City's demand. Obligor represents and warrants that, except as expressly stated in a relocation plan submitted by Obligor to City in connection with this Loan, no residential tenants have been required to vacate or will be required to vacate the Property permanently because of the Project. Obligor shall carry out the terms of any relocation plan approved by City, but the terms of any such plan shall not limit Obligor's obligations under this Loan Agreement or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.

 (i) Architectural Barriers. Obligor shall ensure that the Property, upon completion of the Project, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (see 42 U.S.C. Sections 4151-57), and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).

 (j) Flood Insurance Protection. If the Property is in a special flood hazard area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, then Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that flood insurance is and shall remain in effect, at Obligor's expense, in accordance with Section 102(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001), so long as any amount is outstanding on the Obligor Note.

 (k) Records. Obligor shall maintain and make available to the City and HUD all records reasonably required to demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of this Agreement, for at least four (4) years after full repayment of the Loan.

 (l) Disclosures. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that it has provided to the City any and all disclosures required by the HUD Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3545, and regulations thereunder, 24 CFR Part 4; that it will provide timely updated disclosures to OH to the extent required by such act and regulations; and that all such disclosures are and shall be complete and accurate.

 (m) Prior Actions. Obligor represents and warrants that in all actions related to the Project to date Obligor and each of its affiliates involved in the acquisition of the property, each has complied with all requirements referred to in this Section 5.7.

 (n) Indemnity. Obligor shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand resulting from Obligor's failure to comply with any federal requirement to be complied with pursuant to this Agreement or failure to maintain adequate records to demonstrate such compliance. This provision shall survive expiration of this Agreement.

 5.8 Reports. Obligor shall deliver to the City reports and information as City may require for purposes of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Obligor, which may include copies of tenant certifications, rent rolls, leases, property management agreements and any other contracts affecting the Property.

 5.9 Liens or Claims of Liens. Obligor shall keep the Property free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, superior or inferior to the Deeds of Trust, except for those permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 above and any of the following:

 (a) Liens for property taxes on the Property not yet due and payable;

 (b) The rights of tenants as tenants only under leases entered into in the ordinary course of Obligor's operation of the Property and in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but only to the extent that such leases are subordinate to the liens of the Deeds of Trust, to the Leases (as defined herein), and to any other material leases, which subordinate status shall be insured by endorsement to the City's title insurance policy, at Obligor's expense, within thirty (30) days of request to Obligor by the City; and

 (c) Liens subordinate to the lien of the Deeds of Trust, created after the date of Closing with the prior written consent of the OED Director, in his or her discretion.

 If any claims of lien shall be asserted against the Property other than as permitted by this Section, Obligor, regardless of any action that City may otherwise be authorized to take, shall obtain a release and satisfaction of such lien claim, bond the lien claim, procure title insurance satisfactory to City protecting City from any loss relating to such lien claim, or otherwise provide to City assurances and security satisfactory to City that the lien claim will be paid or satisfied not later than ten (10) days after a judgment on the lien claim. Provided Obligor complies with the previous sentence, Obligor may in good faith contest any worker's or material supplier's lien in legal proceedings that will prevent enforcement of the lien claim and prevent foreclosure of the Property. If such a lien claim is not released or satisfied or a bond or other security satisfactory to City provided within forty-five (45) days of written request from City to Obligor, then the failure to do so shall allow the City to declare an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6.1 below) regardless of whether such lien claim is or is not superior to the Deeds of Trust.

 Nothing in this Section shall be construed to imply that property of a public corporation may be subject to a statutory mechanic's or materialmen's lien or other involuntary lien, nor be construed as consent by Obligor or the City to any such lien.

 5.10 Political Activity. No portion of the Loan shall be used for any political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 5.11 Further Actions. Obligor will at any time and from time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents, opinions, or other instruments or obtain such additional insurance as City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or county regulatory agency.

 5.12 Other Agreements. Obligor shall fully comply in a timely manner with all other agreements for the financing of the Project, including without limitation construction loans, bridge loans, and equity investment contracts ("Other Agreements"), and to the extent that any Other Agreements are the obligations of one of the Owners, the Obligor shall ensure that the Owner complies in a timely manner with the terms thereof, but nothing in this Section shall be construed to waive, or excuse noncompliance with, and provisions of this Agreement or any applicable City ordinances or permits. Obligor shall timely satisfy, and shall ensure that each Owner timely satisfies, all conditions under any Other Agreements to the receipt of funding for the Project and for qualification for historic rehabilitation tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code.

 5.13 Payment of Compensation of Custodian. Obligor shall be responsible for and pay its prorata portion of the fees of the Custodian as provided under the Custodial Agreement. The Custodian's acceptance fee, prorated first annual fee and counsel fees and expenses shall be disbursed to Custodian from the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account at the time of initial Loan disbursement. Thereafter, Obligor shall promptly pay the Custodian's fees and expenses directly to the Custodian.

 5.14 Payment of Other Indebtedness. Obligor shall timely pay the principal, interest and all other amounts due on any other indebtedness or liability now or hereafter owing by the Obligor to any person and secured by the Property; provided, that nothing in this Section shall authorize Obligor to make any payment from any funds or assets pledged to the City hereunder.

 5.15 Transfer of Property. Obligor shall not cause or permit any transfer of the Property or any interest of Obligor therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent of the City, except for the creation of liens, encumbrances or leases that are expressly permitted under the Loan Documents without the City's consent.

 ARTICLE VI - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 6.1 Events of Default. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events and prior to the complete cure thereof by Obligor in a manner satisfactory to the City, the City shall have the right to declare an Event of Default hereunder, without notice or demand by City, except as expressly provided in this Section:

 such breach or nonperformance is susceptible to cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such cure period, (2) Obligor shall commence to cure such breach or nonperformance within such cure period and shall thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceed to cure the same, and (3) Obligor shall inform the City in writing of the status of the cure at the expiration of such cure period and every thirty days thereafter, then such cure period may be extended in the sole discretion of the OED Director for such time as the OED Director determines is reasonably necessary for Obligor to cure such breach or nonperformance;

 (f) A petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or for a receiver or trustee for any of Obligor's property is filed by Obligor, or is filed against Obligor and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or if Obligor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or any attachment or execution is levied against a substantial portion of the property of Obligor and is not discharged within ninety (90) days, or if any law or court order shall require the City, Custodian or any other party to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount paid under the Obligor Note or this Agreement as a preference or for any other reason except refund of duplicative payment;

 (g) Any representation, warranty or disclosure made to City by

 Obligor, or contained in any information submitted by Obligor to City or to any government agency in connection with the Loan or the Property, proves to be materially false or misleading as of the date when made or reaffirmed, whether or not such representation or disclosure appears in this Agreement;

 (h) Any default by Obligor of its obligations under the Certificate and Indemnity, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure provisions thereunder;

 (i) Any default under the Guaranty.

 6.2 Declaration of Event of Default. City's declaration of an Event of Default hereunder shall be made by notice to Obligor pursuant to Section 7.15 of this Agreement and shall be effective as provided therein.

The exercise of any right or remedy by City hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default, or prejudice City in the exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless, in the exercise of said rights, City realizes all amounts owed to it under such Loan Documents.

 6.4 No Default Prior to Declaration. No default or Event of Default shall exist under this Agreement or the Obligor Note until the same shall have been declared by the City or other party authorized to make such declaration; provided, that failure to declare, or delay in declaring, a default hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies or excuse any failure by Obligor to strictly comply with its obligations under all of the Loan Documents.

 ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any noncompliance or breach by Obligor hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such noncompliance or breach, and no express waiver shall affect any breach or noncompliance other than as specified in the waiver. Any waiver shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or of, any act by Obligor requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Delegation to Custodian; Changes in Custodian and Custodial Agreement. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of City, HUD, and Obligor, their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder. The terms hereof shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Obligor's interest hereunder cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of City. Obligor acknowledges and agrees that City may assign to HUD or any custodian or trustee for HUD any or all of City's rights under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents and may direct that any payment or performance be provided directly to HUD or such custodian or trustee, whether or not the Obligor Note or this Agreement have been assigned. Obligor agrees that City may delegate to the Custodian the right to make demands and give directions on behalf of City under the Loan Documents, but that the scope of any such delegation shall be strictly limited to the terms of a written instrument duly signed on behalf of the City. Obligor further acknowledges that the Custodial Agreement may be modified or terminated, or a substitute Custodial Agreement executed, or a successor Custodian appointed, in each case without the consent of Obligor so long as the obligations of Obligor are not increased and the rights of the Obligor under the Loan Documents are not adversely affected in any material respect. Except for minor modifications to the Custodial Agreement not affecting Obligor, City agrees to give reasonable advance notice to the Obligor of any action as described in the preceding sentence, and agrees in each case to provide a copy of any modification or substitute Custodial Agreement to Obligor within fifteen (15) days after the execution thereof.

 7.3 No Defense Based on City Regulatory Actions. Obligor understands that (a) the operations of Obligor in the Property and elsewhere are subject to numerous laws, regulations, ordinances and permits, including those of City and other governmental bodies relating to land use, environmental hazards, and other regulatory matters, and (b) the modification, interpretation, application, or revocation of such laws, regulations, rules or permits could adversely affect economic return to Obligor from the Property. Obligor has conducted its own investigation and relied on the advice of its own counsel and experts as to all such matters in connection with Obligor's acquisition of the Property. Obligor acknowledges that by entering into this Agreement the City does not make, and that

 the City expressly disclaims, any representation or assurance whatever as to (1) the present or future status of the Property or the uses thereof under applicable laws or regulations, including those of the City; or (2) the availability, issuance or continuation of any permits, approvals, or interpretations of any kind that may be required or desired by Obligor or any other party in connection with the Property. Obligor agrees that notwithstanding any regulatory action or omission of City affecting Obligor or affecting the use or development of the Property (whether or not such action or omission shall be determined to be consistent with applicable law in any proceeding), no defense, offset or reduction of liability shall be available to Obligor, at law or in equity.

 7.4 Time. Time is of the essence of all provisions of the Loan Documents.

 7.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the documents, laws and regulations incorporated by reference herein constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Loan and supersede any prior agreements or understandings, written or oral, with respect to the Loan. Obligor is not relying upon any promises, representations or understandings, written or oral, in entering into the Loan Documents, other than as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are not conditioned upon, and shall not be affected by, any other agreement, understanding, performance or nonperformance by the City or any other party, and in any proceeding to enforce any of Obligor's obligations under the Loan Documents, Obligor shall not be entitled to assert, by way of excuse, offset, counterclaim, grounds for equitable relief, or otherwise, any actual or alleged action or inaction by or on behalf of the City except to the extent that any such action or inaction is expressly required of the City by, and is made a condition of Obligor's obligation by, the Loan Documents. No amendment, modification, or termination of any provisions of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of City and by Obligor, and no such writing shall be construed to modify, waive, or affect the terms of the Loan Documents except to the extent that such document expressly so provides.

 7.6 Headings. The article and section headings in no way define, limit, extend or interpret the scope of this Agreement or of any particular article or section.

 7.7 Number and Gender; Joint and Several Obligations. When the context in which the words are used in this Agreement indicates that such is the intent, words in the singular number shall include the plural and vice-versa. References to any one gender shall also include the other gender if applicable under the circumstances. If Obligor comprises more than one person or entity, then each such person or entity shall be bound jointly and severally by this Agreement and the Loan Documents except to the extent otherwise expressly provided therein.

 7.8 Validity. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, the same shall not affect in any respect whatsoever the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.

 7.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle, except to the extent federal law applies.

 7.10 Survival. All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in the Obligor Note shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and of the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan hereunder and continue in full force and effect until the obligations of Obligor hereunder and the indebtedness evidenced by the Obligor Note have been fully paid and satisfied, and thereafter to the extent provided in the Loan Documents, regardless of whether the Obligor Note is surrendered or marked as canceled or paid in full.

 7.11 Venue and Forum. In the event that any legal action should be filed by either party against the other, the venue and forum for such action shall be the Superior Court of the State of Washington for the County of King.

 7.12 Attorney's Fees. In the event either party shall bring an action to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all of its costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.

 7.13 Duplicate Originals; Counterparts. This Agreement shall be executed in duplicate and each of the parties hereto shall receive an original. Each original shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original.

 7.14 Construction. The Loan Documents shall be construed so as to conform to the requirements of the HUD Contract and applicable federal laws and regulations. The Loan Documents are the product of negotiation between the parties and therefore shall not be construed strictly in favor of, or against, either party except as may be specifically provided in the Loan Documents with respect to particular provisions thereof.

 7.15 Notices; Administration by City. Any notice, demand or request required hereunder shall be given in writing at the addresses set forth below by personal service, by facsimile transmission, or by first class mail.

 Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, the OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED.

 7.16 Additional Terms and Conditions

 The terms of this Section are intended to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the terms and conditions set forth above, but in case of any irreconcilable conflict, the terms of this Section

 shall control. The inability of Obligor to satisfy any condition below for any reason shall not excuse any failure to comply in a timely manner with any other provision hereof. All provisions and conditions in this Section, and all other conditions to disbursement set forth in this Agreement, are for the benefit only of the City (and where applicable, HUD) and may be waived in whole or in part by the OED Director in his or her discretion, but no waiver shall be valid unless in writing signed by the OED Director.

 (a) Subordination. Prior to the end of the Loan term, Obligor and the City anticipate that Obligor will desire to obtain private financing and grant a first lien deed of trust on the Property or a parcel thereof to the new lender. The City, upon request of Obligor and reasonable opportunity to review all relevant documents, shall execute and deliver a subordination agreement, in form and content acceptable to the City, by which the Deeds of Trust, but not the Covenant, shall be made subordinate to such new deed of trust, provided that (i) the loan secured by the new deed of trust is on commercially reasonable terms, and does not require a balloon payment prior the final maturity of the Obligor Note; (ii) the Obligor is not then in default hereunder; (iii) the Obligor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the Property's loan to value ratio does not exceed seventy percent (70%); and (iv) the Obligor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the Property has a minimum 1.3 debt coverage service ratio, based upon the maximum periodic payment that might be required under the terms of the financing secured by the new deed of trust. The loan to value ratio shall be computed by dividing the sum of the maximum principal amount of debt that may be secured by senior mortgages and deeds of trust, plus the principal amount of the Section 108 loan, by the total fair market value of the Property (as such value is determined by an appraisal approved by the City and prepared in the same year of the subordination request). The 1.3 debt coverage service ratio requirement will be met if, in the year of the subordination request, the Obligor has received, over the previous 12 months, net operating income from the Project in an amount of at least 1.3 times the actual debt service payable in that year on the Loan, plus the maximum annual debt service on the proposed new first lien loan.

 (b) Asset Management and Loan Monitoring. Obligor acknowledges that it has reviewed the City's Section 108 loan monitoring and asset management policies, and agrees to provide information and otherwise comply with the requirements of such policies. Furthermore, no later than February 1st of each year of the Loan, Obligor agrees to pay an asset management and loan monitoring fee, in the annual amount of Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000), until all amounts owing hereunder shall have been paid in full. It is anticipated that the loan monitoring and asset management duties will be performed by a private entity under contract to OED, and Obligor shall make payment directly to such private entity according to instructions provided by OED.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Obligor and City have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above by and through their duly authorized representatives.

 FORM OF OBLIGOR NOTE

 VARIABLE/FIXED RATE PROMISSORY NOTE

 Seattle, Washington $3,354,000.00

 , 2006

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, 621 King LLC and 507 Maynard LLC (collectively, "Obligor"), Washington limited liability companies, jointly and severally promise to pay to THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Payee"), a Washington municipal corporation, or order, at the time or times provided herein, in lawful money of the United States, the sum of Three Million Three Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Dollars ($3,354,000), with interest as provided herein.

 This Note is given to evidence a loan (the "Loan") made pursuant to the Loan Agreement dated as of , 2006 (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), between the Obligor and the Payee. The funds used by the Payee to make the Loan have been obtained by Payee exclusively through the issuance of a note in the maximum commitment amount of $10,000,000 issued by the Payee, a copy of which note, with a schedule of Principal Due Dates as established by agreement of the City and HUD, is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference (including any note issued in replacement therefor or for a portion thereof that includes the amount disbursed in order to fund the Loan evidenced hereby, the "City Note") pursuant to Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC section5308) and 24 CFR 570.700, et seq., pursuant to which the Payee has entered into certain agreements, including, but not limited to, (a) with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance (as it may be amended, the "HUD Contract") which contract incorporates by reference an Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement between HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), (b) with HUD, the BEDI Grant Agreement #B- _______________, (which documents, as amended or amended from time to time, may be referred to collectively as the "Master Agreement"); and (c) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement (as it may be amended, the "Custodial Agreement"). The Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is made subject to all of the terms and conditions of the HUD Contract, Master Agreement and the City Note. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the City Note, the Loan Agreement, the Custodial Agreement or the Master Agreement as applicable.

 Each portion of principal outstanding on this Note shall bear interest from the date hereof at the rate applicable to the Corresponding Advance of principal under the City Note. For each installment of principal shown on Exhibit 1 hereto, the Corresponding Advance consists of an equal amount of principal on the City Note maturing in the same year as such installment of principal hereunder.

 Interest on this Note shall be due and payable on the 15th day of each calendar month next preceding each of the following dates if interest on the City Note is scheduled to become due and payable on such date: February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year. The amount of interest payable on this Note on each such 15th day shall include interest accrued through such date and interest to accrue through the end of the month in which the interest payment becomes due under this Note. Interest on this Note also shall be due 15 days before any other date when interest shall become due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, and the amount of interest then payable on this Note shall include interest accrued and to accrue up to such date when interest shall become due on the City Note. Interest on the City Note is due and payable quarterly in arrears prior to the Conversion Date, on the Conversion Date, and semiannually thereafter. Principal on this Note is due and payable as set out on Exhibit 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Each date upon which principal or interest, or both, is due and payable hereunder is an "Obligor Note Payment Date."

 The principal amount due under this Note on each Obligor Note Payment Date shall be as set forth on the attached Exhibit 1, except to the extent such principal amount shall have been reduced by prepayment before such Obligor Note Payment Date as provided herein.

 On and after the Conversion Date (whether conversion to a fixed rate or rates is effected with the consent of the Obligor or otherwise), as more fully set forth in the City Note, each Corresponding Advance will accrue interest on the City Note at the fixed rate that the underwriters of the City Note, or securities representing participation interests in a pool of notes guaranteed by HUD, including the City Note, determine will enable them to sell the City Note or such participation interests under then prevailing market conditions as of the Conversion Date at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount thereof.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of any default hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, which default is not cured as permitted by the Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and this Note shall bear interest at the greater of the rate set as provided above or twelve percent (12%) per annum.

 Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest after the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all principal, interest, fees, costs and other charges that Obligor is obligated to pay in connection with this Note and the Loan shall be due and payable, in full, no later than January 15, 2017.

 This Note and other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by Deeds of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and Security Agreements with Fixture Filings (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Deeds of Trust"), of even date herewith, from the Obligor for the benefit of the Payee. This Note and other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by other collateral, including without limitation security interests in the monies and investments held in certain Reserves established in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Master Agreement, and by an assignment of leases and rents. This Note is further secured by a Guaranty of even date, executed and delivered by the ABCD Trust (the "Guarantor")

 The principal hereof and any interest accrued hereon may be prepaid, subject in the case of principal to approval by HUD of prepayment by the Payee of an equal amount of each respective Corresponding Advance on the City Note, and provided, however, that any prepayment shall be applied to the principal installment(s) with latest maturity unless otherwise agreed in writing by the holder hereof and by HUD, and provided, further:

 (a) On or before the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Payee and with, and only with, the consent of HUD. Any prepayment of the principal hereof shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, and partial prepayments shall be credited against the principal amount last becoming due hereunder.

 (b) After the Conversion Date, Obligor shall give 90 days prior written notice of its intention to make any prepayment. No partial prepayment shall relieve the Obligor of the obligation to make any future payments due after the date of any prepayment. Obligor shall pay, in addition to the principal amount of any prepayment, a premium sufficient so that the total amount paid is sufficient to defease the Corresponding Advances on the City Note, as provided in the Master Agreement. If in the event of any prepayment, the Payee incurs any costs, expenses, fees, charges, premiums or losses, the Obligor shall pay such items upon demand in addition to the principal and interest due hereunder.

 After default, any payment by Obligor or any third party, or recovery from the disposition of any collateral, to the extent applied to amounts of principal that were not yet scheduled to fall due according to Exhibit 1, may be applied to such installments of principal as the holder hereof shall elect in its discretion, and shall be deemed a prepayment of such installment for purposes of the premium and other obligations set forth in paragraph (b) above, and Obligor shall pay all such amounts on demand, or the holder hereof may apply amounts so paid or collected to such other obligations, in the holder's discretion.

 In the event of any default by Obligor in any term or condition of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deeds of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, or in the event of any default by Guarantor under the Guaranty, which default is not cured as permitted by the applicable document, the entire principal and accrued interest hereunder shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand at the option of the holder of this Note. If the entire balance of principal and interest shall be declared due and payable after the Conversion Date, then the Obligor shall pay to the holder hereof, in addition to all

 other amounts owing, any further amount required in order that the holder is able to fully defease, solely from the payments by Obligor hereunder and without costs to such holder, all of the outstanding Corresponding Advances under the City Note. Obligor acknowledges that such additional amount, if any, is intended to protect the holder hereof from potential loss resulting from the enforcement of the terms hereof after default, and not as a penalty.

 If Obligor is in default under the provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deeds of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, or if the Guarantor is in default under the Guaranty, and Payee or other holder of this Note commences any action to enforce collection hereof or foreclosure under any security document or guaranty given in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligor agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Payee or such holder, including but not limited to Payee's or such holder's reasonable attorneys' fees.

 Demand, protest, and notice of demand and protest are hereby waived, and the Obligor, to the extent authorized by law hereby waives any and all homestead or other exemption rights which otherwise might apply to the obligation evidenced by this Note, and/or any property covered by any security document given in connection herewith.

 The Obligor executes this Note as a principal and not as a surety.

 ORAL AGREEMENTS, OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LEND MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

In considering proposed amendments to this Agreement or the Approved Application, HUD shall review, among other things, whether the amendment would have affected the ranking of the application in the year it was approved sufficiently to have resulted in the application not ranking high enough for funding, and whether the amendment is otherwise consistent with the Act, the Regulations, and the NOFA. Any increase in the amount of the approved BEDI Grant represents a new grant obligation by HUD and must be documented by a formal amendment to this Agreement, or a new BEDI Grant Agreement, executed on behalf of the parties by officials with the authority to execute the original Agreement.

 b. The Recipient shall at all times maintain an up-to-date copy of its Approved Application, including all amendments approved in writing by HUD, and all drawdowns, deposits, and expenditures of grant funds and program income under this Agreement and any other records required by 24 CFR 570.506, in its files and available for audit or inspection by duly authorized representatives of HUD or the Comptroller General of the United States.

 9. Default; Remedies. A default under this Agreement shall consist of any use of grant funds other than as authorized by this Agreement, any other noncompliance with this Agreement deemed material by HUD, or any misrepresentation or omission in the application submissions which, if known to HUD, would have resulted in this grant not being provided. If HUD determines that the Recipient is in default, HUD will give the Recipient written notice of this determination and the corrective or remedial actions proposed by HUD to cure the default or mitigate its effects, to the extent possible, and to prevent a continuation or recurrence of the default (the "initial notice of default"). Further description of the processes of audit, performance monitoring, and the corrective and remedial actions available to HUD which apply to grants under the Act, including

 this BEDI Grant, is provided in 24 CFR 570, particularly

 Subpart O. No delay or omission by HUD in exercising any right

 or remedy under this Agreement shall impair HUD's ability to exercise such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any Recipient default.

 10. Close-out. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided, close-out of this grant shall be subject to 24 CFR 570.509, or such close-out instructions as may hereafter be issued by HUD specifically for BEDI Grants.

 SECTION 108 OF THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT

 OF 1974, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. section5308

 Date of Contract_______________

 This Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance ("Contract") is entered into between The City of Seattle, Washington, as Borrower (the "Borrower"), and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ("Secretary"), as guarantor for the Guarantee made pursuant to section 108 ("Section 108") of title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act") and 24 CFR Part 570, Subpart M, of the promissory note executed contemporaneously herewith and numbered , in the Maximum Commitment Amount of $10,000,000, and any amended note or note issued in substitution for such note and having the same note number (the "Note"). This is the first Contract under the Funding Approval ("Commitment") of the same number, which was approved by the Secretary on . The funds paid or credited to the account of the Borrower pursuant to the Note are referred to herein as the "Guaranteed Loan Funds." The Note (including the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Trust Agreement as defined in Section I.A. of the Note and incorporated therein) is hereby incorporated into the Contract. Terms used in the Contract with initial capital letters and not otherwise defined in the text hereof shall have the respective meanings given thereto in the Note. The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Trust Agreement are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements," and the Fiscal Agent and the Trustee respectively are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Fiscal Agent/Trustee."

 PART I

 A. The Note: Advances and Records. The Note provides that Advances and Conversion Date Advances shall be made thereunder upon the written request of the Borrower and the approval of the Secretary, pursuant to this Contract and the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Commitment Schedule attached to the Note represents the principal repayment schedule for the Maximum Commitment Amount of the Note. At all times, the total amount of all Advances and Conversion Date Advances under the Note for all Principal Due Dates shall not exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount of the Note. Prior to the Conversion Date (as defined in the Note, Section I.A.), the total amount of Advances made by the Holder for each Principal Due Date under the Note shall not exceed the applicable Commitment Amount for such Principal Due Date set forth in the Commitment Schedule of the Note. Prior to the Conversion Date, the Borrower agrees that the Fiscal Agent pursuant to the Fiscal Agency Agreement shall record the date and amount of each payment and Advance under the Note and shall maintain the books and records of all Advances and Conversion Date Advances for each Principal Due Date, interest rates on Advances, payments, and Principal Amounts outstanding for each Principal Due Date. On and after the Conversion Date, the Borrower agrees that the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement will maintain the books and records of all payments on the Note and all Principal Amounts and interest rates on such Principal Amounts (each as to be set forth on Schedule P&I to the Note). No advances of any kind may be made on the Note after its Conversion Date.

 B. Borrower's Requests for Advances. All requests for Advances or Conversion Date Advances by the Borrower under the Note shall: be in writing; specify the amount of the Advance requested; identify the Note by Borrower, number and Maximum Commitment Amount; be addressed to the Secretary at the address for notices specified in paragraph 12(f) of this Contract; be signed by an authorized official of the Borrower; and otherwise be in the form prescribed by the Secretary. Advances and Conversion Date Advances shall be requested and will only be approved and made in increments of not less than $1,000 for any Principal Due Date. A request for an initial Advance under a Note, or a request for a Conversion Date Advance, shall be received by the Secretary at least ten Business Days prior to the Borrower's proposed Funding Date or Conversion Date, as applicable. All other requests for Advances shall be received by the Secretary not less than five Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date. The Borrower may not deliver a Note or a request for an Advance or Conversion Date Advance to the Secretary more than two calendar months prior to the Borrower's proposed Funding Date. At least two Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date or Conversion Date if the Borrower's request was timely received, or the next available Funding Date for which the request was timely received, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 11(c) or 12 hereof, deliver a corresponding Authorization Order or Advance Order (as applicable) to the Fiscal Agent in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 of the Fiscal Agency Agreement for the applicable Funding Date or Conversion Date. If the Borrower requests an Advance or Conversion Date Advance of less than the outstanding Maximum Commitment Amount under the Note, the Borrower may also specify in its written request the amount of the Advance or Conversion Date Advance to be allocated to each Commitment Amount or Principal Amount per Principal Due Date under the Note. If the Borrower does not specify how the Advance or Conversion Date Advance should be allocated among Commitment Amounts/Principal Due Dates, the Borrower hereby authorizes the Secretary to direct the Fiscal Agent to allocate the Advance to the respective Commitment Amounts or Principal Amounts in order of the earliest Principal Due Date(s).

 C. Conversion; Public Offering. On the Conversion Date (if any), trust certificates backed by the Note (and similar notes issued by other Section 108 borrowers) will be purchased for a purchase price of the full principal amount thereof by underwriters selected by the Secretary (the "Underwriters") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement between the Underwriters and the Secretary, at a closing on such Conversion Date as determined by the Secretary and the Underwriters. The Borrower agrees that the interest rate at which the trust certificate of a specified maturity is sold to the Underwriters shall govern the interest rate inserted on the Conversion Date in Schedule P&I of the Note for the Principal Amount of corresponding maturity.

 D. Consents. By execution of this Contract, the Borrower ratifies and consents to the Secretary's selection of the Underwriters and authorizes the Secretary to negotiate with the Underwriters the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and of the public offering of interests in the trust certificates to investors (including the applicable interest rates). In addition, by execution hereof the Borrower ratifies and consents to the Secretary's selection of the Fiscal Agent/Trustee and agrees to the respective terms of the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements. If Advances have been made in the Maximum Commitment Amount of the Note not less than ten Business Days prior to the proposed Conversion Date, or if the Borrower requests a Conversion Date Advance, the Borrower authorizes the Secretary to deliver Schedule P&I to the Note completed in accordance herewith to the Fiscal Agent/Trustee on the Conversion Date in accordance with the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements, concurrent with delivery of the Secretary's Guarantee of the trust certificates at the closing on the Conversion Date, and thereafter the Note shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms including Schedule P&I. In addition, the Secretary reserves the right to notify the Borrower not less than one calendar month in advance of a specified Conversion Date that the Note will be sold to the Underwriters on such date, if the Secretary in his sole discretion determines that market conditions or program needs require the participation in the proposed public offering of all or substantially all Borrowers with outstanding Advances.

The Guaranteed Loan Funds Investment Account need only be established if and when the Borrower is required to invest, or otherwise invests, the Guaranteed Loan Funds in Government Obligations. Such Letter Agreement must be executed when the Guaranteed Loan Funds Investment Account is established. (A fully executed copy of such Letter Agreement shall be submitted to the Secretary within thirty days of its execution.) All proceeds and income derived from such investments shall be returned to the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account.

(New York City time) on the seventh Business Day (the "Note Payment Date") preceding the relevant Interest Due Date or Principal Due Date (each as defined in the Note). If any Note Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then the required payment shall be made on the next Business Day. Payment may be made by check or wire transfer.

 Upon final payment of all amounts due to Holders under the Note, including any payment made by the Secretary pursuant to the Guarantee, the Fiscal Agent/Trustee is required by the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements to return the Note to the Secretary. Upon final payment to the Secretary of any amounts due as a result of Guarantee Payments or otherwise due under this Contract, the Secretary will cancel and return the Note to the Borrower in discharge of the Borrower's obligations under the Note.

 3. Selection of New Fiscal Agent or Trustee. The Secretary shall select a new Fiscal Agent or Trustee if the Fiscal Agent or Trustee resigns or is removed by the Secretary. The Borrower hereby consents in advance to any such selection and to any changes in the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements agreed to by any Fiscal Agent or Trustee and the Secretary, subject to paragraph 4(e) of this Contract.

 4. Payments Due Fiscal Agent or Trustee; Documents to the Secretary.

 (a) The Borrower agrees to pay the fees of the Fiscal Agent as required by Exhibit G to the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and any additional amounts that may be due pursuant to Section 6.01 of the Fiscal Agency Agreement. If not paid by the Borrower by any other means prior thereto, the Borrower agrees that any such fees or additional amounts that have been incurred prior to an Advance or a Conversion Date Advance may be deducted by the Fiscal Agent/Trustee from the proceeds of the Advance or Conversion Date Advance, as applicable.

 (b) The Borrower agrees to pay the Borrower's share, as determined by the Secretary, of the customary and usual issuance, underwriting, and other costs related to the public offering and future administration of the Note and the trust certificates, as approved by the Secretary, including the cost of reimbursement and/or compensation of the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, including Sections 3.11 and 7.01 thereof. In connection with the public offering on the Conversion Date, such payment shall either be made by wire transfer to the Trustee on the day prior to the Conversion Date or shall be deducted from the Guaranteed Loan Funds on the Conversion Date.

 (c) The Borrower shall submit to the Secretary not later than ten Business Days prior to the Funding Date for the initial Advance hereunder, or if not submitted earlier, prior to any Conversion Date or Public Offering Date applicable to the Note, this executed Contract, the executed Note, a request for an Advance or a Conversion Date Advance (as applicable) in proper form, and an opinion acceptable to the Secretary from the Borrower's counsel to the effect that: (i) the governing body of the Borrower has authorized by resolution or ordinance, in accordance with applicable State and local law, the issuance of the Note and the execution of this Contract; (ii) the Note and this Contract are valid, binding, and enforceable obligations of the Borrower; (iii) the pledge of funds pursuant to 24 CFR 570.705(b)(2) and paragraph 5(a) of this Contract is valid and binding; and (iv) there is no outstanding litigation that will affect the validity of the Note or this Contract.

 (d) The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Underwriters upon demand by the Secretary for the Borrower's share, as determined by the Secretary, of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with a proposed public offering, if the Underwriters incur such

 additional costs for the public offering because of any refusal, inability, or failure on the part of the Borrower timely to submit in acceptable form any document required by this Contract (including paragraph 4(c, or because of any withdrawal by the Borrower from the public offering, after the Borrower has submitted a request for a Conversion Date Advance hereunder.

 (e) The undertakings in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Contract are expressly subject to the requirement that the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements shall in no event require payment of fees or charges, reimbursement of expenses, or any indemnification by the Borrower from any source other than funds pledged pursuant to paragraphs 5 or 15 et seq. of this Contract.

The Loan Repayment Account shall be established and designated as prescribed in the attached form document entitled "Letter Agreement for Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program Custodial Account" (Attachment l) and shall be maintained for such pledged funds. The Loan Repayment Account need only be established if and when the Borrower receives amounts pledged pursuant to paragraph 5(b), 5(c) or 5(d). Such Letter Agreement must be executed when the Loan Repayment Account is established. (A fully executed copy of such Letter Agreement shall be submitted to the Secretary within thirty days of its execution.) Borrower shall make withdrawals from said account only for the purpose of paying interest and principal

 due on the Note (including the purchase of Government Obligations in accordance with paragraph 10 hereof), for payment of any other obligation of the Borrower under this Contract or the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements, or for the temporary investment of funds pursuant to this paragraph, until final payment and discharge of the indebtedness evidenced by the Note, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Secretary in writing. Such temporary investment of funds shall be required within three Business Days after the balance of deposited funds exceeds the amount of the Federal deposit insurance on the Loan Repayment Account. At that time, the balance of funds in the Loan Repayment Account exceeding such insurance coverage shall be fully (100%) and continuously invested in Government Obligations, as defined in paragraph 10 hereof.

 (b) Borrower shall by the fifteenth day of each month, provide the Secretary with a written statement showing the balance of funds in the Loan Repayment Account and the deposits and withdrawals of all funds in such account during the preceding calendar month and a statement identifying the obligations and their assignments in the Loan Repayment Investment Account.

 (c) Upon the Secretary giving notice that the Borrower is in Default under this Contract or the Note, all right, title, and interest of the Borrower in and to the Loan Repayment and Loan Repayment Investment Accounts shall immediately vest in the Secretary for use in making payment on the Note, purchase of Government Obligations in accordance with paragraph 10, or payment of any other obligation of the Borrower under this Contract or the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements.

Any funds specifically available to the Borrower for such payments or as a debt service reserve under an EDI/BEDI Grant Agreement pursuant to Section 108(q) of the Act which supports the eligible project(s) and activities financed by the Note may also be used therefor; any other use of Section 108(q) funds for such purposes shall require the prior written approval of the Secretary. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein or unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Secretary in writing, the Borrower shall substantially disburse funds available in the Loan Repayment or the Loan Repayment Investment Accounts before funds from grants under Section 106 of the Act are withdrawn from the U.S. Treasury for such purposes.

 8. Secretary's Right to Restrict Use of CDBG Funds to Repayment. Upon a determination by the Secretary that payments required by paragraph 2 and/or paragraph 4 of this Contract are unlikely to be made as specified, the Secretary may give the Borrower notice that the availability to the Borrower of funds pledged under paragraph 5(a) of this Contract for purposes other than satisfaction of the pledge is being restricted. This restriction shall be in an amount estimated by the Secretary to be sufficient to ensure that the payments referred to in paragraph 2 and/or paragraph 4 hereof are made when due. This restriction may be given effect by conditioning the restricted amounts to prohibit disbursement for purposes other than satisfaction of the pledge at the time such restricted funds are approved as grants, by limiting the Borrower's ability to draw down or expend the restricted funds for other purposes, and by disapproving payment requests submitted with respect to such grants for purposes other than satisfaction of the pledge.

 9. Secretary's Right to Use Pledged Funds for Repayment. The Secretary may use funds pledged under paragraph 5(a) of this Contract or funds restricted under grants pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Contract to make any payment required of the Borrower

 under paragraph 2 and/or paragraph 4, if such payment has not

 been timely made by the Borrower.

 10. Defeasance. For purposes of this Contract, after the Conversion Date the Note shall be deemed to have been paid (defeased) if there shall have been deposited with the Trustee either moneys or Government Obligations (as defined below), which in the sole determination of the Secretary, mature and bear interest at times and in amounts sufficient, together with any other moneys on deposit with the Trustee for such purpose, to pay when due the principal and interest to become due on the Note. The Aggregate Principal Amount of the Note or any unpaid Principal Amount may be so defeased, in whole or in part, as of any Interest Due Date, or any other Business Day acceptable to both HUD and the Borrower. In accordance with the Note and the Trust Agreement, the Borrower shall give timely notice and written instructions to the Secretary and the Trustee concerning any principal amounts proposed to be defeased, including any Optional Redemptions proposed, which instructions shall be approved by the Secretary. If the unpaid Aggregate Principal Amount of the Note guaranteed pursuant to this Contract shall be defeased and deemed to have been paid in full, then the Borrower shall be released from all agreements, covenants, and further obligations under the Note.

 "Government Obligation" means a direct obligation of, or any obligation for which the full and timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by, the United States of America, including but not limited to, United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness, Notes and Bonds - State and Local Government Series or certificates of ownership of the principal of or interest on direct obligations of, or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America, which obligations are held in trust by a commercial bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has capital and surplus (exclusive of undivided profits) in excess of $100,000,000.

 11. Default. (a) A Default under the Note and this Contract shall occur upon failure by the Borrower to:

 (i) pay when due an installment of principal or interest on the Note; or (ii) punctually and properly perform, observe, and comply with any covenant, agreement, or condition contained in: (A) this Contract, (B) any security agreement, deed of trust, mortgage, assignment, guarantee, or other contract securing payment of indebtedness evidenced by the Note, or (C) any future amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, or extensions of any such documents.

 (b) The Borrower waives notice of Default and opportunity for

 hearing with respect to a Default under paragraph 11(a).

 (c) In addition to Defaults under paragraph 11(a), the Secretary may declare the Note in Default if the Secretary makes a final decision in accordance with the provisions of section 111 of the Act and 24 CFR 570.913 (or any successor provisions), including requirements for reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that the Borrower has failed to comply substantially with title I of the Act. Notwithstanding any other provision, following the giving of such reasonable notice, the Secretary may, in the Secretary's sole discretion pending the Secretary's final decision, withhold the guarantee of any or all obligations not yet guaranteed on behalf of the Borrower under outstanding commitments, suspend approval of any further Advances or Conversion Date Advances under the Note, and/or direct the Borrower's financial institution to: refuse to honor any instruments drawn upon, or withdrawals from, the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account or the Loan Repayment Account initiated by the Borrower, and/or refuse to release obligations and assignments by the Borrower from the Guaranteed Loan Funds Investment Account or the Loan Repayment Investment Account.

 12. Remedial Actions. Upon a Default or declaration of Default under this Contract, the Secretary may, in the Secretary's sole discretion, take any or all of the following remedial actions:

 (a) With any funds or security pledged under this Contract, the Secretary may: (i) continue to make payments due on the Note, (ii) make a prepayment under Section I.D. of the Note or make an acceleration payment with respect to the principal amount of the Note subject to Optional Redemption as provided in Section III of the

 13. Limited Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements or the Note, any recovery against the Borrower for any liability for amounts due pursuant to the Note, the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements or this Contract shall be limited to the sources of security pledged in paragraph 5 or any Special Conditions of this Contract. Neither the general credit nor the taxing power of the Borrower, or of the State in which the Borrower is located, is pledged for any payment due under the Note, the Contract, or the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements.

 In accordance with RCW 35.21.735, the Note and any payments coming due to the Secretary or the United States under this Contract or the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements shall be payable from such security and from any such special funds or accounts, but shall not be obligations of The City of Seattle or the State of Washington and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the City or the State, or any municipal corporation or agency of the City or State, shall be pledged to the payment of principal, interest, or premium, if any, on the Note or for any amounts due under this Contract or the Fiscal Agency/Trust Agreements. Nothing herein shall require the Borrower to make any payment from any source other than the security and special funds or accounts, nor shall anything herein constitute or give rise to a debt or indebtedness of The City of Seattle within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation on the incurring of debt. Any obligations of borrower under documents incorporated herein are subject to the limitation of liability set forth in this Contract.

 The limitations in this paragraph 13 shall not in any way impair the validity or enforceability of the pledge of security under this Contract, which is duly authorized pursuant to RCW 35.21.735, nor limit the rights and remedies of the Secretary with respect to such security.

 14. Incorporated Grant Agreement. The Contract and the Note are hereby incorporated in and made a part of the Grant Agreement authorized by the Secretary on under the Funding Approval for grant number to the Borrower. In carrying out activities with the Guaranteed Loan Funds hereunder, the Borrower agrees to comply with the Act and 24 CFR Part 570, as provided in Subpart M thereof.

 15. Special Conditions and Modifications:

 (a) Paragraph 5(c) of the Contract is amended by deleting the paragraph as written in its entirety and substituting therefor the following:

 "(c) Other security, including, but not limited to, all rights of the Borrower (but none of the obligations of the Borrower) in and to the 'Security Documents' (as defined in paragraph 15(d) hereof) and to the collateral described therein. If necessary to provide the Secretary with a valid security interest in such other security, the Borrower shall execute a security agreement (the 'Borrower Security Agreement'), which Borrower Security Agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary."

 (b) Guaranteed Loan Funds shall be used by the Borrower to finance loans (individually, a "Business Loan") to one or more for-profit and non-profit businesses (individually, a "Business Borrower") pursuant to 24 CFR 570.703(a), 570.703(e), 570.703(f), 570.703(h), 570.703(i) and 570.203, and 570.703(l).

 (c) Each Business Loan shall be evidenced by a promissory note (individually, the "Business Note" and, collectively, the "Business Notes") and a loan agreement (the "Business Loan Agreement"). The Business Note and Business Loan Agreement shall contain such provisions as the Secretary deems necessary. The amount of principal and/or interest payable under the Business Notes during the twelve- month period beginning July 1 of each year and ending on June 30 of the next succeeding year shall be equal to or greater than the amount of principal and/or interest payable under the Note for the corresponding period. No Business Note shall be subject to redemption or prepayment earlier than the earliest possible redemption date under the terms of the Note. The Business Loan shall be fully secured by one or more of the following forms of collateral (collectively, the "Collateral").

 (i) A lien on real property (the "Real Property"), established through an appropriate and properly recorded mortgage or deed of trust (the "Business Mortgage"). The Business Mortgage shall contain such provisions as the Secretary deems necessary. The Business Mortgage may be subordinated to one or more liens on the property; provided, however, that the principal amount of the Business Loan secured by the Real Property shall not exceed an amount equal to 80 percent of the "as improved" appraised market value, less the outstanding balance on other indebtedness secured by a mortgage lien of senior or equal priority on the Real Property.

 (ii) A security interest (collectively referred to as the "Security Interests") in machinery and equipment ("M&E"), accounts receivable, inventory, and other items of personal property collectively, the "Personal Property"). The Security Interests may be subordinated to another lien; provided, however, that the principal amount of the Business Loan secured by the Personal Property shall not exceed an amount determined as follows:

 (A) in the case of used M&E, not more than 90 percent of the appraised net liquidation value, less the outstanding balance of other indebtedness secured by a senior security interest in such M&E; and

 (B) in the case of new M&E, not more than 80 percent of the cost thereof (including installation), less the outstanding balance of other indebtedness secured by a senior security interest in such M&E; and

 (C) in the case of accounts receivable, not more than 80 percent of the average of the ending balances of the last three (3) years of accounts receivable, less the outstanding balance of other indebtedness secured by a senior security interest in said accounts receivable; and

 (D) in the case of inventory, not more than 50 percent of the average of the ending inventory balances of the last three (3) years, less the outstanding balance of other indebtedness secured by a senior security interest in said inventory.

 The Security Interests shall be granted pursuant to an appropriate security agreement (the "Security Agreement"), which Security Agreement also shall be referenced in appropriate Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statements filed in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code. The Security Agreement and such Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statements shall contain such provisions as the Secretary deems necessary.

 (iii) Any and all rights, titles, and interests of the Business Borrower to any leases covering the Real Property. Such rights, titles, and interests shall be the subject of an appropriate and properly recorded collateral assignment of leases and rents (the "Collateral Assignment of Leases and Rents"). The Collateral Assignment of Leases and Rents shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary.

 (iv) Any and all rights, titles, and interests of the Business Borrower in any loan or debt service reserve accounts established for the purpose of securing the Business Loan. Such rights, titles, and interests shall be the subject of a collateral assignment of interest in loan or debt service reserve accounts (the "Collateral Assignment of Interest in Loan or Debt Service Reserve Accounts"). The Collateral Assignment of Interest in Loan or Debt Service Reserve Accounts shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary.

 (v) Such other alternative collateral or security arrangements as may be requested by the Borrower and approved by the Secretary in writing.

 (d) The Borrower shall select a financial institution acceptable to the Secretary (the "Custodian") to act as custodian for the documents specified in paragraph 15(e) below (the "Security Documents"). The Borrower and the Custodian shall enter into a written agreement containing such provisions as the Secretary deems necessary. A fully executed copy of such agreement, with original signatures, shall be forwarded to the Secretary contemporaneously with the delivery of documents pursuant to paragraph 15(e) below.

 (e) Not later than five (5) business days after disbursement by the Borrower of Guaranteed Loan Funds to a Business Borrower, the Borrower shall deliver to the Custodian the following (as applicable to that activity):

 (i) The original Business Note endorsed in blank and without recourse.

 (ii) The original Business Loan Agreement, and an assignment thereof to the Secretary, which assignment shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary.

 (iii) The original recorded Business Mortgage signed by the Business Borrower and an assignment thereof to the Secretary, in a recordable form but unrecorded, which assignment shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary.

 (iv) The original Collateral Assignment of Leases and Rents and an assignment thereof to the Secretary, in a recordable form but unrecorded, which assignment shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary.

 (v) The original Security Agreement and an assignment thereof to the Secretary, which assignment shall be in a form acceptable to the Secretary.

 (vi) The original Collateral Assignment of Interest in Loan or Debt Service Reserve Accounts.

 (vii) If Guaranteed Loan Funds are used to acquire real property, an appraisal of the fee simple ownership interest in the Property. The appraisal shall be completed by an appraiser who is certified by the state and has a professional designation (such as "SRA" or "MAI"), and shall conform to the standards of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA").

 (viii) If Guaranteed Loan Funds are used to acquire used M&E, an appraisal of its net liquidation value.

 (ix) A mortgagee title policy, issued by a company and in a form acceptable to the Secretary, naming the Borrower as the insured party. The policy must either include in the definition of the "insured" each successor in ownership of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or be accompanied by an endorsement of the policy to the Secretary.

 (x) A certified survey with a legal description conforming to the title policy and the Business Mortgage.

 (xi) An opinion of Borrower's counsel on its letterhead, addressed and satisfactory to the Secretary, that:

 (A) the Business Borrower is duly organized and validly existing as a [corporation, partnership, etc.] under the laws of the State of and is [existing, qualified to do business, in good standing, as applicable] in and under the laws of the State of ;

 (B) the Business Note has been duly executed and delivered by an authorized party and is a valid and binding obligation of the Business Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy and similar laws affecting creditors generally; and

 (C) the instruments specified in (ii) through

 ( ) above are valid and legally binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.

 To the extent that the foregoing opinion deals with matters customarily within the due diligence of counsel to the Business Borrower, Borrower's counsel may attach and expressly rely on an opinion of Business Borrower's counsel satisfactory to the Secretary.

 (xii) Any instruments, documents, agreements, and legal opinions required pursuant to paragraph 15(c)(v).

 (f) The Borrower covenants that it shall:

 (i) ensure the diligent performance of the usual and customary functions related to the servicing of the Business Notes; and

 (ii) promptly perfect the Security Interests by filing a financing statement in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code and shall file such additional statements as are necessary to maintain the perfected Security Interests.

 (g) The Borrower shall promptly notify the Secretary in writing whenever an event which constitutes a default (an "Event of Default") under (and as defined in) any of the Security Documents pertaining to a Business Loan has occurred and has continued unremedied for a period of 90 days after such occurrence. Such Business Loan shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Nonperforming Business Loan." However, if a Debt Service Reserve Fund has been established by the Borrower in an amount sufficient to satisfy at least one year's debt service to HUD on the Nonperforming Business Loan(s) at the date that the loan(s) become nonperforming, the Borrower shall have an additional year prior to the required notification to remedy the default. Notification of a Nonperforming Business Loan shall be delivered to the Secretary as directed in paragraph 12(f) above.

 The Borrower shall within 60 days of such notification take one of the following actions:

 (i) The Borrower may replace the Nonperforming Business Loan with another, performing loan (the "Replacement Loan") which meets the security requirements specified in paragraph 15(c). Such replacement shall be effected by delivery to the Custodian of the Security Documents that would be delivered if the Replacement Loan were made from Guaranteed Loan Funds. If the payments of principal and interest on the Replacement Loan are insufficient to satisfy the payments that are due on the Nonperforming Business Loan, the Borrower shall purchase Government Obligations that mature and bear interest at times and in amounts sufficient, together with payments due on the Replacement Loan, to pay when due the principal and interest to become due on the Nonperforming Business Loan. Such Government Obligations shall be deposited in the Loan Repayment Investment Account.

 (ii) If the Borrower elects not to replace a Nonperforming Business Loan, the Borrower shall purchase Government Obligations that mature and bear interest at times and in amounts sufficient to pay when due the principal and interest to become due on the Nonperforming Business Loan. (This action shall be required only with respect to Nonperforming Business Loans that have not been replaced as provided under (i) above.) Such Government Obligations shall be deposited in the Loan Repayment Investment Account.

 (h) Paragraph 12 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following language:

 "(g) The Secretary may complete the endorsement of the Business Notes and record the assignments referred to in paragraph 15(e), and thereby effectuate the transfer of the documents referenced and underlying indebtedness from the Borrower to the Secretary or the Secretary's assignee.

 "(h) The Secretary may exercise or enforce any and all other rights or remedies (including any and all rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code) available by law or agreement (including any of the Security Documents, as defined in paragraph 15(d against the Borrower, against the Business Borrower, or against any other person or property."

 (i) The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Secretary's guarantee of the Note is made in reliance upon the availability of grants pledged pursuant to paragraph 5(a) (individually, a "Pledged Grant" and, collectively, the "Pledged Grants") in any Federal fiscal year subsequent to the Federal fiscal year ending to: (i) pay when due the payments to become due on the Note, or (ii) defease (or, if permitted, prepay) the outstanding Note. The Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that if the Secretary (in the Secretary's sole discretion) determines that Pledged Grants are unlikely to be available for either of such purposes, such determination shall be a permissible basis for any of the actions specified in paragraphs 15(ii) and (iii) below.

 (ii) Upon written notice from the Secretary to the Borrower at the address specified in paragraph 12(f) above that the Secretary (in the Secretary's sole discretion) has determined that Pledged Grants are unlikely to be available for either of the purposes specified in (i) and (ii) of paragraph 15(i) above (such notice being hereinafter referred to as the "Notice of Impaired Security"), the Secretary may limit the availability of Pledged Grants by withholding amounts at the time a Pledged Grant is approved or by disapproving payment requests submitted with respect to Pledged Grants.

 (iii) If after 60 days from the Notice of Impaired Security the Secretary (in the Secretary's sole discretion) determines that Pledged Grants are still unlikely to be available for either of the purposes specified in (i) and (ii) of paragraph 15(i) above, the Secretary may declare the Notes in Default (without additional notice or hearing, which Borrower hereby expressly waives) and exercise any and all remedies available under paragraph 12. This paragraph 15(i) shall not affect the right of the Secretary to declare the Note in Default pursuant to paragraph 11 and to exercise in connection therewith any and all remedies available under paragraph 12.

 (iv) All notices and submissions provided for hereunder shall be submitted as directed in paragraph 12(f) above.
