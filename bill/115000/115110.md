 AN ORDINANCE revising a technical error in the rate schedule provided in Ordinance 121482, which established the Downtown Parking and Business Improvement Area.

 WHEREAS, earlier this year ratepayers representing over 60% of the total assessments expressed their support by petition of the City's intent to establish the Downtown Parking and Business Improvement Area (DBIA), commonly known as the Metropolitan Improvement District (MID); and

 WHEREAS, on May 24, 2004, the City Council passed Ordinance 121482 which established the DBIA; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121482 contained a drafting error in Section 3, representing that the Special Assessment Ceiling Rate for properties where the area ratio is greater than 0.5 would be $0.014 per building net square foot, instead of the legislative intent that this rate would be set at $0.14 per building net square foot; and

 WHEREAS, the total ten-year MID assessment of approximately Thirty- eight Million Six Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($38,610,000) as cited in Ordinance 121482 is based upon the correct Special Assessment Ceiling Rate of $0.14 per building net square foot, and would not be changed by correcting this drafting error; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 3 of Ordinance 121482 is hereby revised as follows:

 Section 3. Levy of Special Assessments. To finance the programs authorized in Section 2, there is proposed to be levied upon and collected from the businesses, multifamily residential properties (buildings containing more than four residential units), and mixed-use properties (buildings with both multi-family residential and commercial units) (collectively, "Ratepayers") in the Downtown Business Improvement Area described in Section 1, a ten-year special assessment in the amount of approximately Thirty-eight Million Six Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($38,610,000). All business and multifamily residential or mixed-used projects within the area established in Section 1 shall be subject to the provisions of this special assessment as authorized by RCW 35.87A.010. The Assessment is measured by the type of use and rate of assessment in the following paragraphs, subject to calculations and limitations in this Section:

 Base Year Assessment = (Land Square Footage x $0.31) + (Total 2002 Assessed Value of Site (Property + Improvements)/$1,000 x $0.29). Records for the assessment calculation are based on information provided by the King County Assessor's Office for the year 2002. For properties with an assessed value of $0, including properties deemed historical, the total appraised value of the property will be substituted into the Base Formula in place of the assessed value. Modification or limitations to these assessments are described below.

 No Base Year Assessment for any individual parcel shall exceed a total amount equal to ($1.50 x Total Assessed Value/$1,000). This rate is called the "Assessment Ceiling Rate." For the following special classifications of Ratepayers a Special Assessment Ceiling Rate shall be applied as set forth below to adjust the basic Base Year Assessment to determine the actual Base Year Assessment to be applied to that particular class of Ratepayer:

 1. Commercial Mixed-Use: $1.50/$1,000 of total assessed value

 2. Surface Parking: $0.85/$1,000 of total assessed value

 3. Multi-Family Residential Apartments - the lesser of: $0.55/$1,000 of total assessed value or $75 per unit.

 4. Multi-Family Residential Condominiums: $75 per unit

 5. Industrial Warehouse: $0.30/$1,000 of total assessed value

 6. Multi-Family Residential Apartments possessing a rent restriction covenant - the lesser of: $0.15/$1,000 of total assessed value or $9 per unit

 7. Hotel - the lesser of: $1.15/$1,000 of total assessed value or $65 per room

 8. Non-Residential (Owned by a Non-Profit): $0.30/$1,000 of total assessed value

 9. Historical or Assessed Value of $0: $0.07 per building net square foot

 10. Floor Area Ratio Greater than 0.5: ~~$0.014~~$0.14 per building net square foot

 11. Non-Profit with Assessed Value of $0: $0.01 per building net square foot

 When both an Assessment Ceiling Rate and one or more Special Assessment Ceiling Rates apply to a single parcel, the Ratepayer shall pay the lesser of the Assessment Ceiling Rate or the lowest Special Assessment Ceiling Rate. The Assessment Ceiling Rate and the Special Assessment Ceiling Rates apply to all properties of the particular class of Ratepayers and shall remain fixed as set out above throughout the ten year assessment period. Property owned by governmental entities or public utilities, and vacant land shall not be assessed.

 Subject to the Assessment Ceiling Rate and the Special Assessment Ceiling Rates, Ratepayers will be assessed by the City for each of the ten years of the assessment as follows:

 July 1, 2004-June 30, 2005: Base Year Assessment formula applied to determine collection amount.

 A credit for payments received for the time period from the establishment date of the DBIA (estimated to be July 1, 2004) through August 22, 2004, shall be applied to the accounts of ratepayers assessed under the existing Downtown Business Improvement Area, established pursuant to Ordinance 119541.

 July 1, 2005 - June 30, 2006: Collection amount for each account shall increase three percent.

 July 1, 2006 - June 30, 2007: Collection amount for each account shall increase three percent.

 July 1, 2007 - June 30, 2008: Base Year Assessment formula applied integrating the most recent total assessed value for each parcel from the King County Assessor's Office.

 July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2009: Collection amount for each account shall increase three percent from the prior year.

 July 1, 2009 - June 30, 2010: Collection amount shall increase three percent from the prior year.

 July 1, 2010 - June 30, 2011: Base Year Assessment formula applied integrating the most recent total assessed value for each parcel from the King County Assessor's Office.

 July 1, 2011 - June 30, 2012: Collection amount shall increase three percent from the prior year.

 July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013: Collection amount shall increase three percent from the prior year.

 "New benefit areas" shall be added to the assessment roll on an annual basis, as follows. A "new benefit area" is created when a parcel's net building square footage increases either as a result of a new building or expansion of an existing building. New benefit areas shall be added to the assessment roll annually in July if its value has been added to the King County Assessor assessment rolls at any point during the preceding year.

 During July 1, 2004- June 30, 2005, July 1, 2007-June 30, 2008 and July 1, 2010- June 30, 2011, new benefit areas shall be assessed according to the appropriate Base Formula factors and Assessment Ceiling rates applicable to use category applicable after new benefit area has occurred. If new benefit areas are added during July 1, 2006 - June 30, 2007, July 1, 2005 - June 30, 2006, July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2009, July 1, 2009 - June 30, 2010, July 1, 2011 - June 30, 2012, or July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013, this new benefit area shall be assessed for that year's collection amount an annual amount in addition to the previous assessment, until the next year in which the Base Year Assessment formula is applied, using the following formula for specific benefit use category of the new benefit area:

 Commercial Condominium

 If property is commercial: $ 0.07 per net new building square foot If property is residential: $75.00 per new unit

 Commercial Mixed-Use $ 0.07 per net new building square foot Hotel $65.00 per new room

 Industrial Warehouse $ 0.03 per net new building square foot

 Multifamily Residential Apartment $75.00 per new unit

 Multifamily Residential Condominium $75.00 per new unit

 Multifamily Residential Apartment/ $ 9.00 per new unit Rent Restricted

 Owned by Nonprofit (Non-residential) $ 0.01 per net new building square foot

 For benefit use categories not listed, no additional assessment shall be imposed on those properties whose net building square footage has increased.
