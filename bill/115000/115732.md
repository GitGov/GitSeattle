 PARTIES and RECITALS

 This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is entered into as of the day of November, 2006, by and between the Puget Sound Regional Council, hereinafter called the Regional Council, and the six following local public transit agencies which shall hereinafter be collectively called LPTAs: Snohomish County Public Transportation Benefit Area Corporation (Community Transit), City of Everett Transportation Services (Everett Transit), King County Department of Transportation (King County Metro), Kitsap County Public Transportation Benefit Area (Kitsap Transit), Pierce County Public Transportation Benefit Area Authority (Pierce Transit), and City of Seattle (Seattle Monorail Services); and the Regional Transit Authority for its designated service area within King, Pierce and Snohomish Counties, hereinafter called the RTA.

 WHEREAS, the Regional Council's Interlocal Agreement for Regional Planning in the Central Puget Sound Area, originally executed in 1991 and amended in 1993 and 2003, established the Regional Council, as provided under various state and federal statutes, to be responsible for development and maintenance of the following: (a) the regional growth and transportation strategy referred to as VISION 2020; (b) the multicounty planning policies [RCW 36.70A.210(e)(7]); (c) the state mandated regional transportation plan (RCW 47.80.030); and (d) the nearly identical federally mandated multimodal Metropolitan Transportation Plan as prescribed in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (23 CFR Part 450 and 49 CFR Part 613); and

 WHEREAS, the LPTAs (RCW 35.58 or 36.57 or 36.57A or 35.95A) and the RTA (RCW 81.104 and 81.112) have been authorized by public vote and state law to plan, fund, develop and operate a public transportation system serving the people of the central Puget Sound region; and

 WHEREAS, the LPTAs are periodically updating their comprehensive transit system plans as required by state law in cooperation with local agencies in their respective service areas and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA), the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and the Regional Council, to assure that their public transportation services and facilities that are deemed regionally significant are consistent with the Regional Council's Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) for subsequent inclusion in Regional Council updates of the MTP; and

 WHEREAS, it is desirable and consistent with the federal requirements to formalize the involvement of transit operators in the metropolitan transportation planning process to support implementation of VISION 2020 and the intent of federal and state transportation statutes to provide a greater emphasis on urban transit services to improve alternative travel options to reduce the growing dependency on single occupant automobile travel in urban areas; and

 WHEREAS, the Regional Council, the LPTAs, and the RTA desire and intend to support and help assure cooperative and well integrated multimodal transportation planning and programming between all agencies in the central Puget Sound region;

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this MOU agree and covenant as follows:

 SECTION 1: PURPOSE

 This MOU is intended to provide a framework for cooperative transportation planning between the parties, avoid duplication of effort, and optimize public transportation planning and investments in support of local, countywide and multicounty growth management policies and objectives in the central Puget Sound region. In addition to such cooperation and coordination being in the public interest, this MOU also satisfies federal regulations requiring such an agreement between the Regional Council (in its role as the designated metropolitan planning organization or "MPO") and the LPTAs and the RTA (as local and regional public transit agencies) to specify cooperative procedures for conducting transportation planning (including corridor and subarea studies) and programming.

 This MOU is also intended to facilitate a close working relationship and regular communications between the Regional Council and the LPTA's and the RTA's policy bodies and staff in order to avoid disputes and to facilitate the performance of their respective public responsibilities.

 SECTION 2: DEFINITIONS

 The following terms used in this MOU shall have the meanings set forth in this section and as now or hereafter defined in the referenced federal or state statutes or regulations:

 A. Central Puget Sound Region means the area included within the counties of King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish; in the State of Washington.

 B. Certification is a statement of verification that local or countywide plans and policies are consistent and coordinated with the adopted regional transportation plan and multicounty policies (RCW 47.80.023).

 C. Consistency is a condition in which plans and policies affecting the area within the regional agency's jurisdiction are compatible and mutually reinforcing. Consistency is achieved when these plans taken together, meet state requirements for consistency in local, regional and state plans (RCW 47.06.040, RCW 47.080.023 and RCW 36.70A).

 D. Consultation means that one party confers with another identified party and, prior to taking action(s), considers that party's views (23 CFR 450.104).

 E. Cooperation means that the parties involved in carrying out the planning, programming and management systems processes work together to achieve a common goal or objective (23 CFR 450.104).

 F. Coordination or to coordinate with means the comparison of the transportation plans, programs, and schedules of one agency with related plans, programs, and schedules of other agencies or entities with legal standing; and adjustment of plans, programs, and schedules to achieve general consistency (23 CFR 450.104).

 G. High Capacity Transit System means a system of public transportation services within an urbanized region operating principally on exclusive rights-of-way, and the supporting services and facilities necessary to implement such a system, including interim express services and high occupancy vehicle lanes, which taken as a whole, provides a substantially higher level of passenger capacity, speed, and service frequency than traditional public transportation systems operating in general purpose roadways (RCW 81.104). The regional transit system in this MOU means the same as the regional high capacity transit (HCT) system and its related financing plan which is under the jurisdiction of the RTA pursuant to Chapters 81.112 and 81.104 RCW.

 H. Major Metropolitan Transportation Investment means a highway or transit improvement of substantial cost that is expected to have a significant effect on capacity, traffic flow, level of service, or mode share at the transportation corridor or subarea scale (23 CFR 450.104).

 I. Major Metropolitan Transportation Investment Study means a study addressing the need for a major metropolitan transportation investment potentially involving federal funds. Major investment studies (including corridor or subarea studies) shall be undertaken to develop or refine the regional transportation system elements of the Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) and lead to decisions by the Regional Council in cooperation with the WSDOT, and other participating agencies, on the design concept and scope of the investment (23 CFR 450.318). Major investment studies undertaken by the WSDOT for planned WSDOT projects or programs shall be conducted in cooperation with the Regional Council as provided by federal regulations. Results of such major investment studies which are consistent with regional plans and policies shall be incorporated by the Regional Council into the Metropolitan Transportation Plan.

 J. Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) means the forum for cooperative transportation decision making for a metropolitan planning area (23 CFR 500.103). Federal laws (23 USC 134 and section 8 of the Federal Transit Act) require that an MPO be designated for each urbanized area and that the metropolitan area, as defined in (49 USC app. 1607 [8] [c]), has a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive transportation planning process that results in plans and programs that consider all transportation modes and support metropolitan community development and social goals (23 CFR 450.300).

 K. Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) means the federally required multimodal and intermodal transportation plan that is developed and adopted through the metropolitan transportation planning process for the metropolitan planning area (23 CFR 450.104, 450.320 and 450.322). Such a plan shall lead to the development and operation of an integrated, intermodal transportation system that facilitates the efficient, economic movement of people and goods (23 CFR 450.300). The Metropolitan Transportation Plan is also the same plan required by the State of Washington Growth Management Act and state legislation for Regional Transportation Planning Organizations which refers to such a plan as a Regional Transportation Plan (RCW 47.80.030).

 L. Project Selection refers to the federal transportation project decision process under which the Regional Council and WSDOT carry out their respective metropolitan and statewide planning and programming responsibilities in a collaborative manner for those categories of federal transportation funds under their respective jurisdiction for project selection decisions. Through project selection, projects are to be included in the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), and, subsequently, the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) consistent with federal regulations (23 CFR 450.332 [b] and [c] and 23 CFR 450.222 [b] and [d].

 M. Public Transportation System Plan means the long-range general comprehensive transit plan for public transit service as required by the state for the establishment and ongoing funding of the RTA and LPTAs. Such comprehensive public transit plan includes, but is not limited to, levels of service that can be reasonably provided within service benefit area, identification of funding requirements, impact of transportation program on other LPTA's operating within that county or adjacent counties.

 N. Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is the regional transportation plan required of the Regional Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO) under state legislation (RCW 47.80.030). The state RTP requirement is met by and referred to as the Metropolitan Transportation Plan.

 O. Regional Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO) is the agency authorized under state law (RCW 47.80) to develop and adopt a regional transportation plan, and to certify that the transportation element of local comprehensive plans conform to requirements of state law and are consistent with the regional transportation plan. The Regional Council is both the RTPO and MPO for the central Puget Sound region. The Regional Council's transportation planning process and transportation plans are intended to meet both state and federal transportation planning and programming mandates.

 P. Right-of-Way Preservation Process refers to the particular factors of the state and regional transportation planning process described in the federal requirements for states and MPOs regarding statewide transportation planning and metropolitan area transportation planning; and in the regional transportation planning process described in state high capacity transit planning requirements (RCW 81.104.080). The process is intended to assure coordination of state, regional and high capacity transit system planning and development with local land use planning. This process involves various roles for the WSDOT, RTA, Regional Council, appropriate cities and counties, and appropriate LPTAs to identify future potential regional transportation system corridor needs and achieve preservation of right-of-way for planned transportation improvements along such identified transportation corridors.

 Q. Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) means the regional multi-year intermodal program of transportation improvement projects which must include at least all federally funded transportation planning and implementation projects and programs for the central Puget Sound region, consistent with the MTP and incorporated as part of the State TIP (23 USC Sec. 134 [a] [3] and 135 [f]). The TIP is submitted to appropriate federal funding agencies for approval (23 CFR 450.104).

 R. Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) means that document developed and adopted annually by the Regional Council, which describes all public transportation and major transportation-related activities which are anticipated within the region during the next one-year period (23 CFR 450.314 [a] [1]).

 SECTION 3: ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

 The parties agree to cooperation, consultation and coordination with each other as follows:

 A. Transportation Planning

 The RTA and the LPTAs shall consult with the Regional Council in the development and modifications of each respective LPTA's transit system and financing plan to assure consistency with the Regional Council's development, refinement and maintenance of its Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP). The Regional Council shall similarly consult with the RTA and all LPTAs for development and updating of the Regional Council's MTP to assure consistency with the adopted system and financing plan for the RTA and each LPTA. The Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs will cooperate with each other (and include the Washington State Department of Transportation and other parties as appropriate) to identify those regional projects and programs which might serve as common elements for any regional and/or locally sponsored major metropolitan transportation investment studies which must be undertaken to achieve regional transit system implementation objectives. The Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs shall also coordinate their system planning activities to assure achievement of mutually compatible and coordinated land use and high capacity and conventional transit system plans. This latter activity shall include cooperation with local agencies in development and refinement of their comprehensive plans, including participation in an appropriate right-of-way preservation review process pursuant to state requirements (RCW 81.104.080) and federal right-of-way planning process requirements [23CFR 450.316(a)(10)] and consistent with adopted Regional Council and RTA policies for mutual cooperation with local government for HCT system station area planning.

 1. Regional Council Emphasis on Multimodal Comprehensive System Planning

 The Regional Council is generally responsible for coordinating comprehensive system and multimodal transportation planning in cooperation with local governments, transit operating agencies, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and port districts within the central Puget Sound region. (ISTEA 23 USC Sec. 134[a][2]; 23 CFR 450.214[b][4] and [c][1]; RCW 47.80.030[1][b] and [3][c]).

 The Regional Council's transportation planning will be supportive of and integrated with local, countywide, and multicounty growth management policies, and Washington State Transportation System Plan policies (23 CFR 450.300 and RCW 47.80.030 [1][b]). In its planning processes the Regional Council shall include policy coordination with the RTA and LTPAs to achieve integrated and supportive efforts in development of the annual Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP), ongoing development and maintenance of the Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP), and development and maintenance of the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The Regional Council's MTP shall incorporate and periodically update a long-range regional financial element, as required by 23 CFR 450.322(11) and RCW 47.80.030, which includes the RTA's and LTPAs' financial needs for the implementation of the respective RTA and LPTA system plans which supports their respective service area's comprehensive plan for public transit service and their respective six-year transit plans (RCW 35.58.240 or RCW 36.57A.060).

 2. The RTA and LPTAs Emphasis on System and Operations Planning

 Each public transportation operator is responsible for developing and implementing its comprehensive transit system plan which is consistent with the regional MTP. The overall implementation plan for the regional transit system element within the MTP will be cooperatively maintained by all parties to this MOU as a major component of the Regional Council's multimodal Metropolitan Transportation Plan and shall include consideration of short- and long-range transit system needs as identified in each public transportation operator's six-year transit plan.

 3. Cooperation on Major Metropolitan Transportation Investments

 The RTA and the LPTAs and the Regional Council shall cooperate on the conduct and completion of appropriate major metropolitan transportation investment studies for corridors and/or subareas to assure effective integration of long- and short-range planning and implementation programming to support growth management plans and policies within the central Puget Sound region.

 4. Cooperation on Transportation Management Systems

 The Regional Council, in cooperation with the WSDOT, and as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process, will consult with the RTA and the LPTAs on public transportation service and facility issues in developing and implementing a congestion management system for the central Puget Sound region. The purpose of the congestion management system is to provide for the effective management of the region's existing and new transportation facilities through an informational planning process that supports travel demand reduction and operational strategies to manage traffic and enhance mobility (23 CFR 500.503). The Regional Council supports coordination between the RTA, LPTAs and the WSDOT, in the development and implementation of other required or optional management systems that are under state responsibility [23 CFR 500.105 (c)]. The RTA and the LPTAs and the Regional Council agree to cooperate with the WSDOT to assure that the information resulting from each management system will, as appropriate, be considered in the development of the statewide transportation plan or the Metropolitan Transportation Plan, and in development of the State Transportation Improvement Program, and the Regional Transportation Improvement Program; and in making project selection decisions [23 CFR 500.105 (8)]).

 5. Regional Data Coordination

 To help assure consistency in planning activities, the Regional Council shall periodically provide the RTA and the LPTAs with current and forecasted demographic, economic, transportation, and other appropriate data as is mutually agreed upon by all parties. Such data requests will be coordinated and processed according to the Regional Council's established data request policy.

 An integral part of the development and maintenance of the MTP shall be a coordinated and consistent monitoring of the performance of the regional transportation system (RCW 47.80.030). The RTA, the LPTAs and the Regional Council agree to cooperate and coordinate in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data in support of the development, maintenance, and use of the management systems; and in support of the development and maintenance of the region's transportation plan.

 6. Cooperation on Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Plan

 The RTA and the LPTAs and the Regional Council shall cooperate on the development and maintenance of a coordinated public transit-human services plan as required by federal law. This plan will be adopted through a process that includes representatives of public, private, and nonprofit transportation and human service providers and participation by the public.

 B. Programming - Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)

 1. The Regional Council

 a. Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The Regional Council,

 in cooperation with the RTA, LPTAs, the WSDOT, and local general purpose governments, is responsible for developing, adopting and maintaining an approved multi-year regional TIP of all prioritized projects which have been approved and programmed by the Regional Council for federal funding after having been found consistent with the MTP and applicable state and federal planning and air quality requirements. The Regional Council must include all regionally significant projects whether or not federal funding is used. The Regional Council must also list regionally significant planning projects in the TIP and the Unified Planning Work Program.

 As required by RCW 47.80.023 [b], and 23 CFR 450.324 [f], the Regional Council will also support and incorporate into the TIP appropriate regional transportation projects proposed by the WSDOT, the RTA, local cities or counties, or LPTAs that do not involve regionally competitive federal or state transportation funds, when such projects are found to be consistent with the MTP and consistent with applicable planning and air quality regulations and guidelines.

 Where applicable within the context of the Regional Council's federal or state project programming authority, project and program implementation for the high capacity transit system shall favor cities and counties with comprehensive plans compatible with the development and implementation of the regional high capacity transit system plan (RCW 81.104.080).

 b. Cooperative Right-of-Way Preservation Review Process. The Regional Council will support future implementation of the regional public transportation system components adopted in the MTP by working with the RTA, the LPTAs and WSDOT on a cooperative right-of-way review process to identify potential future right-of-way needs to support future transportation corridor development projects in the central Puget Sound Region. This process will be consistent with, and to the extent practical, coordinated with the required right-of-way preservation review process for high capacity transportation [RCW 81.104.080 (5)]. The Regional Council, in cooperation with the WSDOT, the RTA, and the LPTAs, will develop a right-of-way preservation review process to support regional transit and roadway system corridor developments consistent with state and federal requirements for regional transportation planning [RCW 81.104.080 (5) and 23 CFR 450.208 (a) (17) and 23 CFR 450.316 (a) (10)]. This process shall incorporate opportunities to assure effective coordination with local comprehensive plans through (1) the Regional Council's plan certification and consistency reviews of local transportation plan elements (RCW 47.80.030), and (2) the listing of locally nominated right-of-way preservation projects proposed for regional TIP funding to support the HCT program and implementation of the Metropolitan Transportation Plan.

 2. The RTA and the LPTAs

 a. Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The RTA and the LPTAs may submit applications to the Regional Council (annually or as the Regional Council's TIP schedule may require) for public transportation planning and system implementation projects for consideration for funding and inclusion in the regionally prioritized TIP. The Regional Council shall give such applications full and fair consideration and emphasis commensurate with the importance assigned to the planning and implementation of a high capacity transportation system for the region in RCW 81.112.010 and for the implementation of the transit component of the Metropolitan Transportation Plan as required by RCW 47.80.030(1).

 b. Cooperative Right-of-Way Preservation Review Process. The RTA and the LPTAs will cooperate with the Regional Council in development and implementation of right-of-way review process noted above and will respond to requests from the Regional Council or local governments for review of potential development proposals or proposed land use zoning actions which may be relevant to right-of-way preservation, HCT development, or other regional transportation system development concerns. Subsequent to such joint reviews, the RTA, the LPTAs, the Regional Council and other local government participants in the right-of-way review process may cooperate in seeking opportunities to protect and secure actual rights-of-way needing preservation to assure the integrity and continuity of the future HCT system plan or regionally significant essential transportation facilities identified in the respective system plans of the RTAs and the LPTAs which are incorporated in the Regional Council's MTP.

 C. Public Involvement

 To coordinate effective planning and programming activities, the RTA, the LPTAs and the Regional Council shall, to the maximum extent practical, coordinate their public information efforts and seek joint opportunities for public involvement. (23 CFR 450.316(b)(1)(xi) and RCW 47.80.070).

 SECTION 4: OTHER SERVICES

 Any Party to this MOU may from time to time enter into additional agreements with each other for purposes and services determined to be mutually beneficial. The Regional Council agrees to give timely and fair consideration to requests for assistance from RTA and any of the LPTAs.

 SECTION 5: AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS

 Any Party to this MOU may request changes to this MOU at any time by written notice to the other individuals identified in Section 12 of this MOU. Such changes as are mutually agreed upon by and between the parties shall be incorporated in written amendments to this MOU executed in the same manner as original MOU approval.

 SECTION 6: POLICY DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION

 A. Board Relations

 The Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs intend to cooperate closely in the development of their respective policies, plans and programs and to actively seek cooperative consultation on issues of major public importance. To that end, the Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs agree to the following:

 1. Reporting

 The Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs agree to encourage timely and appropriate briefings before their respective policy boards to explain progress, have discussions, and seek input on their respective activities which relate to each of the parties' interests or responsibilities.

 2. Representation

 As directed by federal and state laws [23 CFR 450.306 (I), RCW 47.80.040, and RCW 47.80.60], and to facilitate cooperation and coordination on matters of mutual interest, the Regional Council shall include, as voting members, local general purpose government elected officials representing the RTA and the LPTAs on the Regional Council's General Assembly, Executive Board and Transportation Policy Board. The specific numbers for such representation shall be consistent with state statutes and established Regional Council procedures, including the Regional Council's Interlocal Agreement and Bylaws, for determining composition of these bodies.

 The RTA and LPTAs are each entitled to one representative (the Executive Director or his/her designated representative) on the Regional Council's Transportation Operators Committee (TOC). The Transportation Operators Committee is comprised of representatives from the RTA, local public transit agencies, and the WSDOT's Marine and Public Transportation divisions. The TOC was established to provide a forum to cooperatively carry out regional public transportation planning as part of the MPO/RTPO planning and programming process, and to address interagency issues, exchange information, and to advise the Transportation Policy Board on public transportation planning and programming issues.

 B. Planning Coordination

 In an effort to coordinate the agencies' planning efforts as efficiently as possible, the Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs, in cooperation with WSDOT, agree as follows [23 CFR 450.312 (a) (b) and RCW 48.80.023]:

 1. Procedures for UPWP and Financial Support

 The Regional Council shall cooperatively develop a Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) on an annual or biennial basis that describes all public transportation and major transportation-related planning activities for the next one- or two-year period, regardless of funding sources or agencies conducting the activities. The Regional Council will prepare a UPWP and budget that outlines the Regional Council's work activities to be conducted, the schedule for completion, and the products that will be produced. A draft UPWP will be completed for review by all of the above by January 31 each year for the following fiscal year.

 In consultation with the parties to this MOU, the Regional Council's Executive Board shall establish the annual budget for the Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) which shall continue to support public transportation issues. Prior to the Regional Council's adoption of its given Fiscal Year 1999 Budget and Work Program in March, proportional allocation assumptions will be determined by mutual agreement of all parties to this MOU. Annual or biennial assessments will be paid on July 1 of each year.

 The final UPWP and budget shall be adopted by the Regional Council and submitted to WSDOT prior to April 1 preceding the start of each fiscal year. If amendments to an annual or biennial UPWP are desired at any time by any parties to this agreement, all parties that could be impacted by any such proposed amendments shall be consulted prior to any Regional Council action on such amendments. The UPWP and budget may be amended at any time by the Regional Council in accordance with its adopted operational procedures when such amendments do not require changes to LPTA or RTA assessments, pending approval by the WSDOT, FTA and FHWA.

 2. Procedure for MTP and VISION 2020 Updates

 When the Regional Council determines that an update of either VISION 2020 or the MTP is necessary, it will notify the RTA and the LPTAs in writing. This notification shall include information regarding both the process and the schedule that the Regional Council intends to follow for making the MTP update. The Regional Council will consult and coordinate with the LPTAs, the WSDOT, and the RTA as the Regional Council develops potential modifications to the MTP. The development and update of the MTP will also be coordinated with other transportation providers, including regional airport sponsors, maritime port operators, rail freight operators, etc. [23 CFR 450.312 (a)].

 3. Procedure for Transit System and Operational Plan Update

 The RTA and the LPTAs are responsible for developing and implementing a public transportation system and financing plan that is consistent with the Metropolitan Transportation Plan and local comprehensive plans. When any or all of the LPTAs and/or the RTA determines that an update or modification to comprehensive public transportation plan(s) is(are) necessary, such LPTA/RTA will notify the Regional Council in writing. This notification will include both the process and schedule that the LPTA/RTA intends to follow. The RTA and the LPTAs agree to consult with the Regional Council and coordinate with local general purpose governments during the planning process to assure continued consistency with the MTP. The RTA and the LPTAs will provide written notification to the Regional Council of system plan updates.

 4. Procedure for Development of Regional and State TIPs

 On a time line consistent with state and federal law, the Regional Council shall cooperatively develop and/or update a central Puget Sound Regional TIP for all regionally significant transportation projects regardless of funding source. This financially constrained Regional TIP shall be developed through a collaborative process involving regional and subregional forums that include representation of the WSDOT, public transit and port interests. In accordance with federal regulation, the development of the Regional Council's Regional TIP will also be coordinated with other transportation providers, including regional airport sponsors, maritime port operators, rail freight operators, etc. [23 CFR 450.312 (a)]. The federal portion of the Regional Council's Regional TIP shall be provided to WSDOT by October 1 of a given Regional Council TIP update year, for incorporation into the State TIP (STIP). The development of the Regional Council's state required TIP (State TIP) shall also be done through a collaborative process essentially the same as described for the Regional TIP. This State TIP document is intended to serve as a broader public planning document defining

 and describing the region's short-range action strategies for implementation of the MTP.

 5. Procedures for Certification of Transportation Elements of Comprehensive Plans for Cities and Counties

 The Regional Council's adopted Policy and Plan Review Process will be used to certify that the transportation elements of the comprehensive plans for counties, cities and towns within the central Puget Sound region are in conformance with state planning requirements and are consistent with the Regional Council's Metropolitan Transportation Plan. The Regional Council, as part of the above process, must also certify that countywide planning polices for King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties and the Metropolitan Transportation Plan are consistent. The Regional Council's adopted processes provide direction for certifying the transportation elements and countywide planning policies, and also provide an opportunity to coordinate and share information.

 Counties, cities and towns within the region will notify the Regional Council in writing of amendments to comprehensive plans and countywide planning policies; certification review is required and may result in additional certification of the amendment or transportation element. These review and certification processes are to be used to increase the coordination of the transportation planning activities of the LPTAs, the WSDOT, the RTA and the Regional Council with all local jurisdictions.

 6. Procedures for Reviewing the State Transportation Plan and Transit Agency Plans

 As part of the Regional Council's review process, WSDOT's long-range state transportation plan and the long-range public transportation system plans as developed by LPTAs and the RTA to serve the central Puget Sound region shall also be reviewed for consistency with the adopted Metropolitan Transportation Plan. The Regional Council shall prepare a report on consistency when it reviews these plans and will make the report available to the WSDOT and the Commission, or appropriate local or regional transit agency for review and comment. As required by state law (RCW 81.104.080 and 81.104.090), the Regional Council will take action on the findings of conformance of the RTA's amendments to the RTA System Plan. Upon requests of the LPTAs, the Regional Council will also take action on findings of conformance on long-range System Plans developed by the LPTAs.

 SECTION 7: DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 Significant differences between the parties regarding issues not otherwise addressed or covered under a separate dispute resolution process and which are not able to be readily resolved by informal discussion and negotiations between the Executive Directors of the Regional Council and one or more of the affected LPTA party's, will be submitted for discussion to dispute resolution panel to be composed of three (3) board members from each party involved in a given dispute. This panel shall be appointed by each party's respective governing board to seek and propose a consensus recommendation of the panel members which shall then be presented for consideration to the full boards of each party.

 SECTION 8: TERMINATION

 This MOU may be terminated by any party to this MOU upon written notice to the other parties specified in Section 12 Notification, at least six months prior to the start of the other parties' fiscal year. Such notice shall explain the rationale for the declaration of the intent to terminate the MOU and shall confirm that such termination is supported through action of the initiating party in the same manner as the original MOU was approved.

 SECTION 9: REPLACEMENT CLAUSE

 As of the date of final execution of this MOU, this MOU fully supersedes and replaces any applicable Transportation Planning Agreements entered into between the Regional Council's predecessor agency, the Puget Sound Council of Government and each of the six respective LPTAs, and between the Puget Sound Regional Council and the Regional Transit Authority.

 SECTION 10: COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

 The Regional Council, the RTA and the LPTAs shall each comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Nothing in this MOU alters, or seeks to alter, the existing statutory authority of any party to this MOU under state or federal law. If any of the provisions of this MOU are held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
