 WHEREAS, commercial zones are the primary places where business is conducted and goods and services are provided to the community; and

 WHEREAS, a significant proportion of future growth within the city is anticipated to occur within commercially zoned areas; and

 WHEREAS, the main goal of the new commercial chapter of the Land Use Code is to support the City's growth management objectives by advancing Seattle's Comprehensive Plan urban village strategy; and

 WHEREAS, the objectives of the new commercial chapter of the Land Use code include supporting job creation and business vitality, protecting and enhancing neighborhood character, encouraging more pedestrian-friendly, walkable neighborhoods, increasing housing opportunities, creating the right mix and supply of parking, supporting transit connections, simplifying zoning requirements, allowing flexibility in order to achieve better design, and making the Land Use Code easier to use; and

 WHEREAS, a key strategy for implementing the goals for neighborhood commercial areas is the application of new or expanded pedestrian-designated ("P-suffix") zones, initially proposed in five neighborhoods, and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development has undertaken the Pedestrian Designation Mapping Project, a citywide review of additional neighborhood commercially zoned areas for the purpose of identifying and designating new pedestrian-designated zones, and will make recommendations to the Council in 2007 and 2008; and

 WHEREAS, once the review of pedestrian designation mapping recommendations is completed, the Council intends to remove the limits on residential use at the street level on arterials outside of pedestrian-designated zones and Neighborhood Commercial 1 zones; and

 WHEREAS, the City has conducted extensive analysis and public review of the proposed changes to development regulations for commercial zones, and other changes in this ordinance, in order to develop a recommendation that will help achieve the goals and objectives outlined above;

 (2) The residential use generally should not be located in close proximity to industrial areas and/or nonresidential uses or devices that have the potential to create a nuisance or adversely affect the desirability of the area for living purposes as indicated by one of the following:

 (a) The nonresidential use is prohibited in the NC3 zone;

 (b) The nonresidential use or device is classified as a major noise generator; or

 (c) The nonresidential use is classified as a major odor source.

 (3) In making a determination to permit or prohibit residential uses in C2 zones, the Director shall take the following factors into account:

 (a) The distance between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisances;

 (b) The presence of physical buffers between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisance uses;

 (c) The potential cumulative impacts of residential uses on the availability for nonresidential uses of land near major transportation systems; and

 * * *

 D. Exceptions.

 1. Streets With Existing Curbs.

 a. Streets With Right-of-Way Greater Than or Equal to the Minimum Width. When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of-way is greater than or equal to the minimum width established in subsection A6 of this section, but the roadway width is less than the minimum established in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual, the following requirements shall be met:

 (1) All structures on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.

 (2) A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 (3) If there is no sidewalk, a sidewalk shall be constructed in the portion of the right-of-way abutting the lot, except when the following types of projects are proposed:

 i. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures; and

 ii. Additions to existing structures ~~which~~that are exempt from environmental review.

 b. Streets With Less than the Minimum Right-of-Way Width. When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of- way is less than the minimum width established in subsection A6~~5~~ of this section, the following requirements shall be met:

 (1) Setback Requirement. A setback equal to half the difference between the current right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection A6 of this section shall be required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. In all residential zones except Highrise zones, an additional three (3) foot setback shall also be required. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standards, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground structures that would

 not prevent the future widening and improvement of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director after consulting with the Director of Transportation.

 (2) Grading Requirement. When a setback is required, all structures on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street according to the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.

 (3) No-protest Agreement Requirement. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 2. Projects With Reduced Improvement Requirements.

 a. One (1) or Two (2) Dwelling Units. When one (1) or two (2) dwelling units are proposed to be constructed, or one (1) or two (2) Single Family zoned lots are proposed to be created, the following requirements shall be met:

 (1) If there is no existing hard-surfaced roadway, a crushed- rock roadway at least sixteen (16) feet in width shall be required, according to the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.

 (2) All structures on the lot(s) shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.

 (3) A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 b. Other Projects With Reduced Requirements. The types of projects listed in this subsection D2b are exempt from right-of-way dedication requirements and are subject to the street improvement requirements of this subsection:

 (1) Types of Projects.

 i. Proposed developments that contain fewer than ten (10) units in SF, LDT and L1 zones, and six (6) residential units in all other zones;

 ii. The following uses when they are smaller than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet of gross floor area: major and minor vehicle repair uses, and multipurpose ~~convenience~~retail stores;

 iii. Nonresidential structures that have less than four thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area and that do not contain uses listed in subsection D2b(1)ii that~~which~~ are larger than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet;

 iv. Structures containing a mix of residential uses and either nonresidential uses or live-work units, if there are fewer than ten (10) units in SF, LDT and L1 zones, or fewer than six (6) residential units in all other zones, and the square footage of nonresidential use is less than specified in subsections D2b(1)ii and D2b(1)iii;

 v. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;

 vi. Additions to existing structures that are exempt from environmental review; and

 vii. Expansions of a surface parking area or open storage area of less than twenty (20) percent of parking area or storage area or number of parking spaces.

 (2) Paving Requirement. For the types of projects listed in subsection D2b(1), the streets abutting the lot shall have a hard- surfaced roadway at least eighteen (18) feet wide. If there is not an eighteen (18) foot wide hard-surfaced roadway, the roadway shall be paved to a width of at least twenty (20) feet from the lot to the nearest hard-surfaced street meeting this requirement, or one hundred (100) feet, whichever is less. Streets that form a dead end at the property to be developed shall be improved with a cul-de-sac or other vehicular turnaround in accordance with the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual. The Director, after consulting with the Director of Transportation, shall determine whether the street has the potential for being extended or whether it forms a dead end because of topography and/or the layout of the street system.

 (3) Other Requirements. The setback, grading and no-protest agreement requirements of subsection D1b shall also be met.

 3. Exceptions from Required Street Improvements. The Director may waive or modify the requirements for paving and drainage, dedication, setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements, landscaping and curb and sidewalk installation when it is determined that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met:

 a. Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 b. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 c. Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for green street, boulevards, or other special rights-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.

 d. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would eliminate street access to an existing lot.

 e. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met.

 f. One (1) or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely.

 g. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot, for example due to an inability to meet the required twenty (20) percent maximum driveway slope.

 h. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the street is at zoned capacity.

 E. Exceptions.

 1. Streets With Existing Curbs.

 a. Streets With Right-of-way Greater Than or Equal to the Minimum Right-of-way Width. When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot, and improvements would be required by subsections B or D of this section, and the existing right-of-way is greater than or equal to the minimum width established in subsection A of this section, but the roadway width is less than the minimum established in the Right- of-Way Improvements Manual, the following requirements shall be met:

 Section 68. Section 23.54.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 122208, is amended as follows:

 23.54.015 Required parking.

~~A. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for specific uses shall be based upon gross floor area, unless otherwise specified, as set forth in Chart A, except for uses located in downtown zones, which are regulated by Section 23.49.019, and Major Institution uses, which are regulated by Section 23.54.016. (See Chart A for Section 23.54.015.)~~Minimum parking requirements for uses in the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District to which a maximum parking ratio applies shall be reduced to the extent necessary, if any, to allow compliance with the maximum parking ratio as it applies to all such uses on the same lot.

 If floor area of a use for which parking is required is added to a lot for which one or more minimum parking ratios has been reduced under the previous sentence, or if the floor area of any such existing uses on such a lot are modified, or both, then any reductions in minimum required parking ratios shall be adjusted so that the total of all reductions in required parking for uses on that lot is the amount necessary to permit compliance with the applicable maximum parking ratio.

 B. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned on Chart A, the requirements for off-street parking shall be determined by the Director. If there is/are comparable uses, the Director's determination shall be based on the requirements for the most comparable use(s). Where, in the judgment of the Director, none of the uses on Chart A are comparable, the Director may base his or her determination as to the amount of parking required for the proposed use on detailed information provided by the applicant. The information required may include, but not be limited to, a

 description of the physical structure(s), identification of potential users, and analysis of likely parking demand.

 C. If an entire use or structure, or the same portion of a use or structure, falls under more than one category in Chart A, then unless otherwise specified the category requiring the least amount of parking spaces shall apply, but only so long as the criteria in that category are satisfied.

 D. Existing legal parking deficits of legally established uses shall be allowed to continue even if a change of use occurs. This subsection shall not apply to a change of use to one defined as a heavy traffic generator. This subsection shall not be construed to permit a parking deficit caused by the failure to satisfy conditions of a reduced parking requirement for any use or structure.

 E. In all zones, no parking shall be required for the first twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area of nonresidential uses in a structure. This waiver shall not apply to structures or portions of structures occupied by restaurants with drive-in lanes, motion picture theaters, administrative offices or institutional uses, including Major Institution uses. When two (2) or more uses, with different parking ratios occupy a structure, the twenty-five (2,500) square foot waiver shall be prorated based on the area occupied by the nonresidential uses for which the parking waiver is permitted.

 F. Exceptions to the parking requirements set forth in this section are provided in Section 23.54.020, Parking quantity exceptions, unless otherwise specified in Chart A.

 G. Except in downtown zones, off-street parking for fleet vehicles shall be provided separately, in addition to the minimum parking requirements.

 H. For nonschool uses permitted to locate in a former or existing public school by a School Use Advisory Committee (SUAC), parking requirements shall be determined by the school use criteria, according to Chapter 23.78, Establishment of Criteria for Joint Use or Reuse of Schools.

A. Minimum parking requirements. The minimum number of off- street motor vehicle parking spaces required for specific uses is set forth in Chart A for nonresidential uses other than institutional uses, Chart B for residential uses, and Chart C for institutional uses, except as otherwise provided in this Section and Section 23.54.020. The minimum parking requirements are based upon gross floor area of a use within a structure and the square footage of a use when located outside of an enclosed structure, or as otherwise specified. Exceptions to the parking requirements set forth in this section are provided in subsection B and in Section 23.54.020, Parking quantity exceptions, unless otherwise specified.  B. Exceptions to Required Parking.

 1. Parking in downtown zones is regulated by Section 23.49.019 and not by this section;

 2. No parking for motor vehicles is required for uses in commercial zones in urban centers and in the Station Area Overlay District, except that parking for fleet vehicles is required;

 3. Parking for major institution uses is regulated by Section 23.54.016 and not by this Section;

 4. Parking for motor vehicles for uses located in the Northgate Overlay District is regulated by Section 23.71.016 and not by this Section; and

 5. No parking is required for business establishments permitted in multifamily zones.

 C. Maximum parking limits.

 1. In the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District certain uses are subject to a maximum parking ratio pursuant to subsection 23.74.010A1b. When there are multiple uses on a lot, the total parking requirement for all uses subject to a maximum ratio cannot exceed the aggregate maximum for those uses under Section 23.74.010.

 2. In all commercial zones, except C2 zones outside of urban villages, no more than one hundred forty-five (145) spaces per lot may be provided as surface parking.

 3. In all multifamily zones, no more than ten (10) parking spaces may be provided per business establishment.

 D. Parking waivers for nonresidential uses.

 1. In pedestrian-designated zones, parking is waived for uses listed on Chart D. The parking waivers permitted in Chart D apply to each business establishment on a lot.

 a. Additional parking waivers beyond those in Chart D may be permitted as a special exception for the following uses:

 (1) Eating and drinking establishments, up to a maximum waiver of five thousand (5,000) square feet; and

 (2) Motion picture theaters, up to a maximum waiver of three hundred (300) seats.

 b. The following factors will be considered by the Director in determining whether to permit additional parking waivers:

 (1) Anticipated parking demand for the proposed use;

 (2) The extent to which an additional parking waiver is likely to create or add significantly to spillover parking in adjacent residential areas;

 (3) The availability of shared parking within eight hundred (800) feet of the business; and

 (4) Whether land is available for parking without demolishing an existing commercial structure, displacing a commercial use, or rezoning property to commercial.

 2. In all other commercial zones and in pedestrian designated zones for uses not listed in Chart D, no parking is required for the first one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet of each business establishment.

 3. In all other zones, no parking is required for the first two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area of nonresidential uses in a structure, except for the following:

 a. structures or portions of structures occupied by restaurants with drive-in lanes,

 b. motion picture theaters,

 c. offices, or

 d. institutional uses, including Major Institution uses.

 When two or more uses with different parking ratios occupy a structure, the twenty-five thousand (2,500) square foot waiver is prorated based on the area occupied by the nonresidential uses for which the parking waiver is permitted.

 E. Fleet vehicles. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, off-street parking shall be provided for all fleet vehicles and those parking spaces will not be counted toward the parking requirements of Chart A, Chart B, or Chart C.

 F. Use and reuse of schools. For non-school uses permitted to locate in a former or existing public school, parking requirements will be determined by school use pursuant to criteria adopted according to Chapter 23.78, Establishment of Criteria for Joint Use or Reuse of Schools.

 G. New nonresidential uses in existing structures. Up to twenty (20) required parking spaces are waived for a new nonresidential use established in an existing structure or the expansion of an existing nonresidential use entirely within an existing structure. For purposes of this section, "existing structure" means a structure that was established under permit, or for which a building permit has been granted and has not expired, at least two (2) years prior to the application to establish the new use or expand the use.

 H. Uses not shown on parking charts. In the case of a use not shown on Chart A, Chart B, or Chart C, the requirements for off- street parking will be determined by the Director based on the requirements for the most comparable use. Where, in the judgment of the Director, none of the uses on Chart A, Chart B, and Chart C are comparable to a proposed use, the Director may base his or her determination as to the amount of parking required for the proposed use on detailed information provided by the applicant. The information required may include, but not be limited to, a description of the physical structure(s), identification of potential users, and analysis of likely parking demand.

 I. Uses in multiple parking chart categories. If an entire use or structure, or the same portion of a use or structure, falls under more than one category in Chart A, Chart B or Chart C then, unless otherwise specified, the category requiring the smallest number of parking spaces applies except as expressly set forth on such charts.

 J. Existing parking deficits. Existing legal parking deficits of legally established uses are allowed to continue even if a change of use occurs. This subsection will not be construed to permit a parking deficit caused by the failure to satisfy conditions of a reduced parking requirement for any use or structure.

 K. Bicycle parking. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces for bicycles required for specified uses is set forth in Chart E. In the case of a use not shown on Chart E, there is no minimum bicycle parking requirement. The minimum requirements are based upon gross floor area of the use in a structure, or the square footage of the use when located outside of an enclosed structure, or as otherwise specified.

 1. After the first fifty (50) spaces for bicycles are provided, additional spaces are required at one half (1/2) the ratio shown in Chart E, except for rail transit facilities; passenger terminals; and park and ride lots. Spaces within dwelling units or on balconies do not count toward the bicycle parking requirement.

 2. Required bicycle parking shall be provided in a safe, accessible and convenient location. Bicycle parking hardware shall be installed so that it can perform to its manufacturer's specifications and any design criteria promulgated by the Director of Transportation, allowing adequate clearance for bicycles and their riders. Directional signage shall be installed when bike parking facilities are not clearly visible from the street or sidewalk. When any covered automobile parking is provided, all required long-term bicycle parking shall be covered. When located off-street, bicycle and automobile parking areas must be separated by a barrier or painted lines.

 3. Long-term parking for bicycles shall be for bicycles parked four (4) hours or more. Short-term parking for bicycles shall be for bicycles parked less than four (4) hours.

 4. Bicycle parking required for residential uses must be located on-site.

 5. Bicycle parking facilities shared by more than one use are encouraged.

 6. Bicycle parking facilities required for nonresidential uses shall be located on the lot or in a shared bicycle parking facility within one hundred (100) feet of the lot, except as provided in subsection 7 below.

 7. Bicycle parking may be located in a facility within one hundred (100) feet of the lot that is not a shared bicycle parking facility, or the applicant may make a payment to the City to fund public bicycle parking in lieu of providing required on-site bicycle parking, if the Director determines that:

 a. Safe, accessible and convenient bicycle parking accessory to a nonresidential use cannot be provided on-site or in a shared bicycle parking facility within one-hundred (100) feet of the lot, without extraordinary physical or financial difficulty;

 b. The payment is comparable to the cost of providing the equivalent bicycle parking on-site, and takes into consideration the cost of materials, equipment and labor for installation;

 c. The bicycle parking funded by the payment is located within sufficient proximity to serve the bicycle parking demand generated by the project; and

 d. Construction of the bicycle parking funded by the payment is assured before issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development.

 (1) Required parking for spectator sports facilities or exhibition halls must be available when the facility or exhibition hall is in use. A facility shall be considered to be "in use" during the period beginning three (3) hours before an event is scheduled to begin and ending one (1) hour after a scheduled event is expected to end. For sports events of variable or uncertain duration, the expected event length shall be the average length of the events of the same type for which the most recent data are available, provided it is within the past five (5) years. During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring events, the best available good faith estimate of event duration will be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be fifty (50) percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at the rate of one (1) space for each ten (10) fixed seats of certified projected attendance. An application for reduction and the certification shall be submitted to the Director at least fifteen (15) days prior to the event. When the event is one of a series of similar events, such certification may be submitted for the entire series fifteen (15) days prior to the first event in the series. If the Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of fifty (50) percent or less of the seating capacity is based on satisfactory evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket sales, the Director shall, within fifteen (15) days of such submittal, notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change. The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded. (2) The amount of required parking is calculated based on the maximum number of staff or animals the center is designed to accommodate.
