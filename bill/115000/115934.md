 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Center; lifting 2007 budget provisos that restrict expenditures from Seattle Center's operating and capital budgets.

 WHEREAS, under Ordinance 122298, the City Council adopted a budget, including a capital improvement program and position modifications, for the City of Seattle for fiscal year 2007; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2007 Budget the City Council approved a budget proviso preventing Seattle Center from spending money appropriated for 2007 for Seattle Center's Lot 2 Development Capital Improvement Program project until authorized by a future ordinance and until Seattle Center identifies a relocation site on the Seattle Center campus for the Lot 2 skate park and basketball court and submits a potential site analysis and recommendations to City Council; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2007 Budget the City Council approved a budget proviso restricting spending in Seattle Center's operating budget until authorized by future ordinance, after the Council had the opportunity to review Seattle Center progress on key Council initiatives; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Center submitted to the City Council on February 28, 2007 site analyses for three potential sites for a skateboard park on the Seattle Center campus; and

 WHEREAS, in the first quarter of 2007 the City Council has had the opportunity to review Seattle Center progress on key Council initiatives; and

 WHEREAS the City Council desires to lift the two budget provisos referenced above; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The restrictions imposed by the following budget provisos are removed and they are no longer restrictions for any purpose including for Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 122298:

 Department Green Proviso Descriptions BCL Sheet # Code/Project ID

 Seattle Center 116-1-C-5 Prohibits the spending of the S0501 money appropriated for 2007 for Seattle Center's Lot 2 Development Project BCL (Project ID S0501) until authorized by a future ordinance, such authorization anticipated by the Council to take place after Seattle Center identifies a relocation site on the Seattle Center campus for the skate park and basketball court, and submits a potential site analysis and recommendations to Council, including potential conversion of green space, open space, or a portion of the Fun Forest, and a recommendation on a site to begin design and construction in 2007 toward a 2008 opening date.

 Seattle Center 59-1-A-3 Limits the amount that can be SC690 spent from the funds appropriated for 2007 for Seattle Center's Administration-SC BCL to no more than $4.5 million until authorized by a future ordinance, such authorization anticipated by the Council to take place after Council reviews, during the first several months of 2007, Seattle Center's progress on key Council initiatives, and concludes that Seattle Center management is making reasonable progress.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. In coordination with removing the budget provisos described in Section 1 of this ordinance, this ordinance declares Council's preferred site for replacement of the Seattle Center Lot 2 skatepark as the Seattle Center Pavilions site, on the corner of Second and Thomas Streets.

 This decision includes the demolition of the existing structures on the site (Pavilions A and B) and the construction of a new skatepark. The Council intends that up to $1.2 million of funds in the Lot 2 Development Project (Project ID S0501) are dedicated for demolition of the existing structures and the Lot 2 sale proceeds designated for construction of the new skatepark ($960,000) are dedicated to building the replacement skatepark.

 The City Council requests that Seattle Center develop a project scope, timeline, estimated costs, and schematic designs for demolition of Pavilions A and B and the replacement Seattle Center skatepark as described above by October 15, 2007. The Skate Park must be completed by the end of the second quarter 2009 subject to regulatory review or appeals, and a proposal for relocating current users of the existing Seattle Center Pavilion buildings in Fisher Pavilion, the Exhibition Hall, the Northwest Rooms or other space on the Seattle Center Campus must be included.

 The City Council further requests that Seattle Center work directly and collaboratively with the Skate Park Advisory Committee (or equivalent if this committee is reorganized and renamed) to include an experienced skatepark designer as part of the selected multiple discipline consultant team. The final site design should include no less than 8,900 square feet of skateable terrain and attempt to incorporate surrounding perimeter areas for additional amenities, viewing area and open space for families and spectators to view the skatepark and create a family-friendly environment.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
