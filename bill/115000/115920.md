 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE amending Section 2.04.250 of the Seattle Municipal Code to require campaign committees to file weekly reports of deposits beginning in June of an election year instead of July, and eliminating the requirement that campaign committees file reports of deposits totaling $500 or more the week following a general or special election.

 WHEREAS, the State has moved the date of the primary election from September to August; and amended its campaign disclosure law to require campaign committees to begin filing weekly reports of deposits in June instead of July; and

 WHEREAS, conforming City law to State law serves the public's interest in full and timely disclosure in the weeks before the primary election, without imposing an additional burden on campaign committees; and

 WHEREAS, requiring campaign committees to file reports the week following an election imposes a burden on campaign committees that is not outweighed by any public benefit;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 2.04.250 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 2.04.250 Treasurer's reports -- Procedures.

On the day the statement of organization is required under Section 2.04.160 or Section 2.04.170 to be filed with the City Clerk, a report of all contributions received and expenditures made prior to that date shall be filed with the City Clerk. Such report of contributions and expenditures is not required if no contributions were received and no expenditures were made prior to that date.

 B. At the following intervals each campaign treasurer shall file with the City Clerk a further report of the contributions received and expenditures made since the date of the last report:

 1. On the twenty-first (21st) day and seventh (7th) day immediately preceding the date on which the election is to be held; and

 2. On the tenth (10th) day of the first (1st) month after the election;~~provided, that this report shall not be required following a primary election from;~~a. A candidate whose name will appear on the subsequent general election ballot,

 b. Any continuing political committee; and

 3. On the tenth day of each month in which no other reports are required to be filed under this section; provided, that such report shall only be filed if the committee has received a contribution or made an expenditure in the preceding calendar month and either the total contributions received or total expenditures made since the last such report exceed Two Hundred Dollars ($200);

 4. In the case of a City general election or a special election held in conjunction with any general election, the campaign treasurer shall file a final report no later than the tenth (10th) day of May after the date of the general election; and in the case of a special election that is not held in conjunction with any general election, the final report shall be filed no later than the tenth (10th) day of the sixth (6th) month after the date of the special election.

 The period for which activity shall be reported (the "reporting period") in the required reports shall be as follows:

 a. The report to be filed twenty-one (21) days before the election shall report all contributions received and expenditures made from the closing date of the last report filed through the end of the fifth (5th) business day before the date of the report.

 C. For the period beginning the first (1st) day of the fourth (4th) month preceding the date on which the special ~~or general~~ election is held, or for the period beginning the first day of the fifth month before the date on which the general election is held, and ending on the Monday eight (8) days before the date of that special or general election, the campaign treasurer or deputy treasurer shall file with the City Clerk each Monday a report of each contribution deposited during the previous seven (7) days.

Contributions from any person that total Twenty-Five Dollars ($25) or less in the applicable period may be reported by a candidate, candidate committee, ballot proposition committee or continuing political committee as a lump sum without identifying the contributor(s) by name. The campaign treasurer shall retain a copy of each report in his or her campaign records. Each record shall be certified as correct by the campaign treasurer or a deputy campaign treasurer making the deposit.

 E. The campaign treasurer shall maintain books of account accurately reflecting all contributions and expenditures on a current basis within five (5) business days of receipt or expenditures.
