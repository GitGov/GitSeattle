In the event of such delegation of approval authority, employing units shall continue to maintain internal written documentation of all Information Technology Professional Compensation Program base pay changes and the reasons therefore. This delegation of approval authority may be rescinded at the discretion of the Personnel Director. Accordingly, S.M.C.4.20.430, Subsection D, is hereby amended as follows:

 D. Each employee in the Information Technology Professional Compensation Program will be assigned a base rate of pay within the pay zone by the appointing authority upon the Personnel Director's approval. The Personnel Director may delegate approval of base pay changes to the appointing authority. Such delegation may be rescinded at the discretion of the Personnel Director.

 If during the initial program implementation in January 2000 the rate of pay received by an incumbent immediately prior to assignment to the Information Technology Professional Compensation Program is higher than the upper limit of the pay zone recommended by the Personnel Director, or is higher than the rate established for the position by the appointing authority, the employee will retain an incumbency rate of pay in such position until any market adjustments to the pay zone equal or exceed the incumbency rate; provided, the incumbency rating shall be maintained only as long as the duties assigned to the position are commensurate with the rate of pay.

 Section 7. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
