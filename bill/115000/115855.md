Open Space Restoration and Repair

BCL/Program Name: Campuswide Improvements and Repairs BCL/Program Code: S03P01

 Location: Campuswide Project

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A

 This ongoing project funds the renovation and repair of open spaces, green spaces, hard surfaces, and fountains throughout the 74-acre Seattle Center campus. Past work includes replacing the supershooters and controls in the International Fountain, replacing the information kiosk along Thomas Street, pedestrian and landscape improvements along Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, improving hardscape along the covered walkway between Harrison and Republican Streets, recaulking the International Fountain bowl, renovating landscape west of the Seattle Children's Theatre, and repairing hard surface in heavily-trafficked areas. Work planned for 2007-2008 includes hard surface renovation, completion of a tree replacement and landscape plan for the Seattle Center campus, and replacement of 71 trees to begin implementation of the plan. Also planned in 2007-2008 is the use of~~the Mayor proposed allocation of~~ $1 million from the proceeds of the sale of Lot 2 for the restoration of the Broad Street Green, and another  $215,000~~1 million~~ of Lot 2 sale proceeds for design of improvements at two major campus entries: 2nd Avenue at Thomas and 5th Avenue at Thomas and Broad.

 In the 2007 budget process, the City Council ~~directed that $785,000 of Lot 2 sale proceeds be allocated to the Seattle Center Long Range Investment Plan (CIP project S0703) and~~ adopted a proviso to prohibit spending on the restoration of the Broad Street Green and improvements to campus entries at 2nd Avenue at Thomas and 5th Avenue at Thomas and

 Broad until authorized by future ordinance. ~~In response to these Council directives, Seattle Center will propose to the City Council in early 2007 revisions to the Center's Capital Reserve Plan for the allocation of Lot 2 sale proceeds. Until these revisions are submitted, $785,000 is reduced from the allocation of Lot 2 proceeds to the Open Space Restoration and Repair project.~~

Theatre District Improvements

 BCL/Program Name: Theatre District Improvements BCL/Program Code: S0103

 Project Type: Improved Facility Start Date: 1st Quarter 2000

 Location: Mercer St./2nd Ave. N/5th Ave. N

 The Theatre District Improvements project includes a series of open space and pedestrian improvements along both sides of Mercer Street, at the north edge of Seattle Center. In 2000, the Kreielsheimer Foundation provided $300,000 to fund schematic design of the Theatre District to coordinate with the exterior plazas for McCaw Hall, and awarded $3.0 million in challenge grants for development of open space between the Intiman and the Bagley Wright Theaters and for acquisition of property on the north side of Mercer Street between Second Avenue N and Warren Avenue N. These grants require matching funds from public or private sources, which are shown as To Be Determined below. The match deadline is December 31, 2007, although the Board of Directors of the Foundation can extend the deadline to 2010 if they determine satisfactory progress is being made on the match. In 2004, concept design work was completed for the "Theatre Commons" space between the Intiman and Bagley Wright theaters in order to support fundraising for implementation of the project. Through 2006, Seattle Center has secured $100,000 of the required $1.0 million in matching funds for the Theatre Commons. Another $ 400,000~~100,000~~ of matching funds are provided in 2007 from the proceeds of the sale of Lot 2. Design work on the Theatre Commons will continue in 2007 in conjunction with the development of the Seattle Center Long Range Investment Plan. The current concept level cost estimate for this project is $5.3~~0)~~ million (2007 dollars), with significant~~the majority of the~~ funding expected to come from private sources. The scope and cost of the project will be reviewed, together with the capacity for private funding, as planning continues. Theatre District improvements are expected to be made incrementally as funding is available.
