The City and Sound Transit entered into an agreement titled "Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation Regarding Light Rail Development" on April 20, 1998 ("April 20, 1998 MOA") that sets forth the Parties' common and individual objectives with respect to the development of a light rail system within the City of Seattle and that established the foundation of their working relationship with common objectives for cooperation.

 B. Sound Transit is constructing the Initial Segment and Airport Link extension of Link Light Rail from Downtown Seattle to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and has completed environmental review of the North Link extension. Sound Transit has identified "University Link" as the next priority for extending the light rail system, which includes 3.15 miles of tunnel, two additional stations (Capitol Hill Station and University of Washington Station), and other supporting facilities (e.g., Montlake Vent Facility). City services necessary to support the development and design of the University Link Project ("Project") are consistent with the principles and approach of the April 20, 1998 MOA.

 C. The Parties' common and individual objectives set forth in the April 20, 1998 MOA will continue to be observed during the term of this University Link Supplement, including the principles of intergovernmental cooperation, expedited reviews and permit processing, and the process for dispute resolution.

 D. The City recognizes that Sound Transit has the responsibility for the acquisition and disposition of property, and that real-estate decisions will be governed by the Sound Transit Board's policy on Transit-Oriented Development and by state and federal regulations.

 E. As anticipated by the Parties in sectionIII.E of the April 20, 1998 MOA, Sound Transit desires actions by the City to support the

 completion of design and initiation of construction of the Central Link Light Rail Project. This University Link Supplement, except as otherwise provided herein, shall cover services to be provided by the City in four primary areas: Program and Project Management, Utility Engineering, Design Review, and Permitting.

 F. Sound Transit recognizes that the City is responsible for administering state and local transportation and land use laws and development regulations that will apply to the development, construction, and operations of the Project. In addition, the City is responsible for review and approval of plans, utility relocation, managing the City rights-of-way, and the public health and welfare of

 citizens.

 G. The City of Seattle recognizes that University Link will provide numerous benefits to Seattle's residents, workers, and visitors, and will help the City meet its Comprehensive Plan goals for dense, mixed use urban centers and urban villages connected by high-quality public transit. In recognition of these and other mutual benefits, the City is committed to providing general support and coordination as typically provided between governmental agencies to facilitate the timely completion of the Project.

 H. Sound Transit's Project is partially funded by the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") and Sound Transit is therefore required to include applicable FTA contract provisions in all of its third party agreements, including its agreements with the City; and such applicable federal contract provisions must be incorporated by the City in all third party contracts that are funded under this Supplement.

The City recognizes that inconsistent review comments usually cause delay, result in added staff time for review, and may result in unnecessary change orders or additional costs to the Project. The City intends to provide consistent review comments. If inconsistent comments are discovered by Sound Transit, the City will resolve the inconsistencies immediately upon written notice from Sound Transit. The City will promptly take corrective action to minimize any added costs to Sound Transit as a result of such inconsistencies and avoid providing similar inconsistent comments on future reviews.

 3.11. Sound Transit Response to City Review Comments and Resolution of Issues

 3.11.1. The City will submit formal written comments consolidated by SDOT to Sound Transit for each of the Early Work, 60%-, and 90%- Complete Submittals within the timeframe specified in subsection 3.9. Sound Transit must address and respond to every written comment submitted by the City. Depending on the number and magnitude of comments by the City on the 90%-Complete Submittal, Sound Transit shall work with City staff to resolve all issues through, among other means, conducting one-on-one meetings, making additional plan sheet revisions and obtaining approval by concurrence memos or meeting minutes, conducting a key stakeholder group plan review session, or advancing the issue to the next level of administration to resolve the issues in a timely manner. SDOT shall notify Sound Transit in writing when all outstanding design issues have been resolved based on the 90% - Complete Submittal comments. Both the City and Sound Transit shall work collaboratively to get issues resolved in a timely manner prior to Sound Transit delivering the 100%-Complete Submittal to the City for approval. Approval of the 100%-Complete Submittal is a prerequisite to issuance of the Project Construction Permit by SDOT necessary to fulfill the permitting requirements of the Agreement Between the City of Seattle and Sound Transit for Grant of Non- Exclusive Use of a Light Rail Transit Way as Related to the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project (authorized by Ordinance 119975, as amended).

 3.12. Plan Approval and Project Construction Permits

 3.12.1. Sound Transit must submit a one-week advance notice prior to submitting the 100% - Complete Submittal to SDOT. Sound Transit will submit three (3) half-size plan sets for approval. SDOT will coordinate a final check of the submittal and will provide written concurrence within 15 Working Days of receiving the three plan sets if the 100% - Complete Submittal has adequately addressed the City comments.

 3.12.2. When written notice of approval of the 100% - Complete Submittal is given to Sound Transit, SDOT will invite Sound Transit to submit drawings with SDOT-assigned vault and serial numbers for signature.

 3.12.3. The City's costs associated with generating the Project Construction Permit are based on time and materials, and will be reimbursed by Sound Transit through this supplement. A final processing/filing fee will be invoiced by the City to Sound Transit for each construction contract's Project Construction Permit per the Street Use Permit Fee Schedule.

 3.13. DPD Review and Issuance of Permits

 3.13.1. The City and Sound Transit will implement a fast-track permit process for DPD Master Use Permits (MUPs) and building permits for the Project. MUP applications and building permit applications to DPD shall be handled pursuant to the DPD permitting process described below and in Exhibit A. All other DPD permits (including side-sewer permits, electrical permits, or required permits for mitigation projects or impacted third parties) shall be handled as part of DPD's regular business operations.

 3.13.2. Master Use Permits. Sound Transit will seek three separate MUPs for the Capitol Hill Station site, the University of Washington Station site, and the Pine Street Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) retrieval pit as described in Exhibit A. A shoreline permit will also be required as part of the MUP process for the University of Washington site. An additional MUP may be required for the Montlake Vent Facility.

 3.13.3. Building Permits. Sound Transit will seek separate building permits for the Capitol Hill Station site and the University of Washington Station site. Additional building permits may be required for the Montlake Vent Facility and Pine Street TBM retrieval pit.

 Certain principles shall be applied by Sound Transit to the greatest extent practicable to achieve certain goals of the City. These principles are discussed in the following subsections.

 5.1. Minimize City Maintenance and Operation Costs

 The Project shall be designed to the greatest extent practicable to minimize any increase in City maintenance and operation costs directly caused by the Project. Prior to the issuance of construction permits, Sound Transit and the City shall agree in principle on the delineation of ongoing maintenance and operational responsibilities that are likely to be experienced by the City as a direct result of the Project or operation of the resulting light rail system. Such issues and costs include but are not limited to the reconstruction or realignment of any street, sidewalk, bikeway or utility facility or system; the re-timing or other modifications of existing traffic signals; and the installation of new traffic signal, signage, lane markings, street lighting, sidewalk lighting, or pathway lighting within the construction limits of the Project. Final agreement of maintenance and operation responsibilities for University Link facilities will be documented as supplements to the Central Link Maintenance Agreement.

 5.2. Project Design to Minimize Travel and Access Disruptions

 The Project shall be designed to the greatest extent practicable to minimize disruptions to City businesses and residents during construction. To achieve that result, Sound Transit and the City shall work cooperatively with representatives of businesses and neighborhoods affected by the Project. The Project shall also be designed such that:

 5.2.1. The number of streets in contiguous blocks that are closed or permitted to have severely restricted vehicular or pedestrian traffic during the Project's construction phase is minimized, by construction being undertaken either at varying times of day, in geographic stages, or through other means;

 5.2.2. Emergency vehicle, utility maintenance vehicle and fire protection vehicle access is preserved to every business and residence directly-affected by the Project construction, and pedestrian access to each such residence, and to each such business during its normal business hours, are preserved at all times;

 5.2.3. Vehicular access for types of vehicles other than those identified in subsection 5.2.2 to every residence directly-affected by the Project construction is preserved except when construction requirements necessitate the complete blockage thereof; and

 5.2.4. Reasonable prior notice is provided to directly-affected property owners, business tenants and neighborhood residents of any loss or change of access to or from their respective properties, tenancies and residences, indicating the expected duration of such loss or change, and alternatives that are available to those affected by such loss or change.

 6.0 REIMBURSEMENTS

 6.1. Sound Transit's Maximum Funding Obligation

 Sound Transit's maximum funding obligation for the City's services under this University Link Supplement is contained in Exhibit C - Budget. Sound Transit shall not be obligated to reimburse any expenditure in excess of the maximum amount stated in Exhibit C, unless authorization is received from its Board of Directors and upon the execution of a new supplement or an amendment of this University Link Supplement upon such terms and conditions as are approved by the Board. If at any time, and for any reason, the City's costs are projected to exceed the amount covered by this University Link Supplement, the City shall notify Sound Transit without delay.

 * Sound Transit will engage DPD and the Fire Department early in the design process to identify potential code conflict and interpretation issues. Signed letters of concurrence will be used by the Parties to document code interpretation decisions and provide guidance for Sound Transit's design.

 * Sound Transit will submit shoring plans for the construction sites for Phase 1 building permits at 60% design. DPD will provide review of these shoring plans within 4 weeks of receiving a full and complete submittal.

 * Sound Transit will submit building plans for the stations for Phase 2 building permit at 90% design. DPD will provide review of these building plans within 4 weeks of receiving a full and complete submittal.

 * Sound Transit and DPD anticipate that early identification and discussion of code issues will result in a shorter correction period. DPD reviewers will be encouraged to inform Sound Transit of any concerns early in the review period.

 * The City will coordinate permit review between DPD building permits and SDOT Project Construction Permits to avoid duplication of review efforts.

 DPD Staff Assignments

 DPD will assign experienced staff to the Project. DPD personnel assigned to the Project are responsible for prioritizing Project work within the department, anticipating and responding to priorities identified by Sound Transit, coordinating with Sound Transit if Project priorities change, and helping to resolve issues (including those that cross DPD divisions and City department jurisdictions) to facilitate Sound Transit's ability to submit complete applications that meet the City's requirements. Project work will be the highest priority of these staff when Project work is pending. Appropriate DPD staff will participate in regular permit coordination meetings with Sound Transit staff and consultants, as needed, to ensure close Project coordination. Sound Transit may request that DPD expedite review of a specific submittal critical to the project, in which case DPD will make that submittal the highest priority for review.

 Expedited Permit Processing

 It is in the mutual interest of the Parties to ensure timely Project design reviews and expedited permit processing. Sound Transit and DPD have agreed to an "Expedited Services" work approach that will allow DPD to provide priority staffing and services to Sound Transit for the University Link Project. Expedited permit processing applies to the Master Use Permits, building permits, and other DPD-issued permits and reviews identified in this scope of work.

 Light Rail Review Panel

 The Light Rail Review Panel (LRRP) will review the Project on behalf of the City's Design, Planning, and Arts Commissions. Sound Transit will present Early Work, 60%, and 90% station architectural plans and station artwork proposals to LRRP for review. Staff time to support and coordinate LRRP's review will be charged under this Task.

 Noise Abatement Program Support

 Sound Transit intends to seek noise variances for the construction of University Link. DPD Noise Abatement Program staff will assist Sound Transit in developing the Project's approach to noise abatement and preparing applications for noise variances. Actual processing of noise variance submittals will be handled outside this agreement.

 Other DPD Permits

 Issuance of DPD permits other than the Master Use Permits and building permits described above are not included under the scope of this task. These are anticipated to be handled as regular DPD business, and include:

 * Noise variances for construction

 * Building permits for Maintenance Base modifications

 * Electrical permits

 * Side-sewer capping and installation permits

 * Permits associated with University of Washington mitigation projects

 * Permits associated with future redevelopment of Sound Transit property

 Task 4 - SCL Design Review and System Engineering Services

 Sound Transit and the City jointly recognize the need to evaluate Seattle City Light (SCL) infrastructure and the ability to provide adequate utility service during the construction and operation of University Link. Under this task, SCL will:

 * Support Sound Transit's early work on utility impacts.

 * Review Sound Transit's civil designs for impacts to SCL infrastructure, including potential relocations and protect-in-place mitigation strategies.

 In addition, SCL will undertake system engineering studies to identify service options based on Sound Transit service needs. System engineering work will be managed by task order to allow key Project and management decisions to be made and inform subsequent task orders. Initial task orders will focus on:

 * Identifying potential points of contact for Sound Transit connections for temporary construction (TBM) and permanent operational (TPSS and station) needs.

 * Evaluating substation capacity and potential power routes to deliver power for construction and operation.

 Subsequent task orders will focus on conceptual SCL engineering to identify:

 * Preliminary concept and cost estimate for feeder and substation service.

 * Final concept and cost estimate for feeder and substation service.

 SCL's Departmental Manager will:

 * Manage the planning, design review, and cost estimating of electrical transmission and distribution system relocations along the Project alignment.

 * Coordinate services among SCL's three service centers, power stations, and systems planning office, various City departments, and Sound Transit to efficiently and safely design and construct necessary improvements in support of the Project.

 Basis of Scope and Budget Estimate

 The City and Sound Transit have developed the Scope of Work and budget based on experience with the Initial Segment of Central Link Light Rail and understanding of Sound Transit's University Link design process, current design contract packaging and the anticipated Project schedule as described in Exhibit B.

 The budget represents the Parties' best estimate for completing the Scope of Work, but does not represent a fixed fee commitment to complete the Scope of Work. The City will endeavor to manage the Scope of Work within the budget. A budget contingency has been established for this agreement and will be managed by Sound Transit to ensure that any higher or unanticipated City expenses (pre- approved by Sound Transit) can be reimbursed within the total budget amount described in Exhibit C.

 Assumptions

 In addition to those assumptions stated elsewhere in this University Link Supplement, the following assumptions have been used in estimating the effort required to complete this Scope of Work.

 * These estimates are for work to be performed in direct support of the Project.

 * Geotechnical information and settlement impacts have not yet been fully determined for the Project. This scope assumes that Departmental Managers and City-retained consultants will review geotechnical and settlement reports for impacts to City infrastructure. The budget does not include the development of significant settlement monitoring and mitigation measures, should these efforts prove necessary.

 * Estimates are based on the Parties adhering to the definitions of Early Work, 60%-, and 90%-Complete Submittal as outlined in the University Link Supplement.

 * Estimates assume that value engineering proposals to eliminate the Montlake Vent Facility will be successful.

 * Budgets reflect anticipated 2007 hourly rates and overhead charges inflated by 3% for 2008.

 * Formal design submittals and reviews will transpire in substantial compliance with the anticipated schedule provided in Exhibit B.

 * Estimates assume that no Parks Department facilities will be directly impacted by University Link construction activities.

 * Real estate transactions for easements or subsurface rights on City-owned property that is not street right-of-way will be handled outside the scope of this agreement.

 * SCL budget estimates assume:

 o Sound Transit will provide construction and operation load characteristics for supply studies.

 o Final electrical design is not covered in this Scope of Work.

 o SCL support for the contract bid process or construction services is not included in this Scope of Work.

 * DPD budget estimates assume:

 o Sound Transit will fund "Expedited Services" as detailed in Exhibit C.

 o Fees for MUPs are based on standard DPD hourly MUP review rates as detailed in Exhibit C.

 o Fees for building permits will be charged on an hourly time and materials basis in lieu of value-based construction fees.

 o Sound Transit shall pay fees for other types of permits according to the DPD Fee Ordinance. The fees for these permits are not a part of the funding described in this agreement, and include but are not limited to the following:

 * Noise variances for construction

 * Building permits for Maintenance Base modifications

 * Shoreline permit

 * Electrical permits

 * Side-sewer capping and installation permits

 * Permits associated with University of Washington mitigation projects

 * Permits associated with future redevelopment of Sound Transit property.

 o Resources for inspections during construction, or other building plan review support after correction notices are issued, will be negotiated as part of a future construction services agreement.

 Budget and Contingency

 The budget for each Task of this University Link Supplement is described in Exhibit C. A contingency of 10% was included in the total budget for the Supplement. The reallocation of uncommitted funds between tasks is allowed subject to prior written approval by Sound Transit. The use of contingency is subject to written approval by Sound Transit.
