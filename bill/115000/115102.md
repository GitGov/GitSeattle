 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Seattle Department of Transportation to impose four-hour on-street parking time limit restrictions for vehicles displaying disabled parking placards, and amending Chapters 11.16, 11.23, 11.72 and 11.73 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, Washington State RCW 46.16.381 allows local jurisdictions to establish a four-hour time limit on the use of on-street parking spaces for vehicles displaying disabled parking placards; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan establishes transportation goals to manage the parking supply to achieve neighborhood and business district vitality, auto trip reduction and improved air quality, as well as to seek balance among competing parking needs; and

 WHEREAS, in 2003, the Seattle Department of Transportation conducted a downtown Seattle on-street parking survey and found that: almost all surveyed meters were full all day during a typical weekday; about 30% of the parking spaces surveyed were occupied at some time during the day by vehicles with disabled parking permits, with most being placards; and the average stay for vehicles with disabled parking permits was almost three times greater than as for those without such permits; and

 WHEREAS, the findings of Seattle Department of Transportation's 2002 Seattle Parking Management Study recommended considering the implementation of the four-hour time restriction to ensure the most efficient management of limited curb space in downtown Seattle and neighborhood business districts; NOW, THEREFORE,
