 Underground facilities.

 Following the initial construction of all or a portion of its systems, Grantee may, from time to time, construct such additional facilities as it may require for such systems. Grantee shall have the right of access to the Easement Area over and across the Property to enable Grantee to exercise its rights hereunder. Grantee shall compensate Grantor for any damage to the Property caused by the exercise of such right of access by Grantee. Grantee shall have the obligation, to the extent provided by Grantee's applicable rates and tariffs and law, to maintain and repair its facilities.

 2. Grantor's Use of Easement Area. Grantor reserves the right to use the Easement Area for any purpose not inconsistent with the rights herein granted, provided, however, Grantor shall not construct or maintain any permanent structures on the Easement Area or any temporary buildings, structures or other objects on the Easement area which may result in damage or restrict access to Grantee's facilities. Grantor shall do no blasting within 300 feet of Grantee's facilities without Grantee's prior written consent, which consent would not be unreasonably withheld.

 3. Indemnity. Grantee agrees to indemnify Grantor from and against liability incurred by Grantor as a result of Grantee's negligence in the exercise of the rights herein granted to Grantee, but nothing herein shall require Grantee to indemnify Grantor for that portion of any such liability attributable to the negligence of Grantor or the negligence of others.

 4. Termination.

Said release of easement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 5. Abandonment. The rights herein granted shall continue until such time as Grantee ceases to use the Easement Area for a period of five (5) successive years, in which event, this easement shall terminate and all rights hereunder, and any improvements remaining in the Easement Area, shall revert to or otherwise become the property of Grantor; provided, however, that no abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred by reason of Grantee's failure to initially install its systems on the Easement Area within any period of time from the date hereof.

 6. Relocation. Grantee shall relocate its facilities as necessary for Grantor to preserve or remediate any environmentally sensitive areas on any part of Grantor's property. Said relocation shall take place at Grantor's cost, and shall be subject to Grantee's rates and tariffs and all applicable laws.

 7. Successors and Assigns. Grantee shall have the right to assign, apportion or otherwise transfer any or all of its rights, benefits, privileges and interests arising in and under this easement.
