 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the provision of emergency severe winter shelter services; increasing an appropriation to the Fleets and Facilities Department for life-safety and other building system enhancements to enable the occupancy of vacant space in the western base of Seattle City Hall; increasing an appropriation to the Human Services Department; reducing a previous appropriation to the Fleets and Facilities Department; and amending the description of the Fleets and Facilities Department's 2005-2010 Capital Improvement Program's "Civic Center Plan - Key Tower, Park 90/5, and Other Capital Projects" project; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Hall was constructed with an unfinished space within the building's western base that has been discussed as a space for future civic, cultural, and/or retail uses; and

 WHEREAS, the City continues to study options for the long-term programming, operations, and funding of this City Hall space consistent with the vision of the Civic Center Master Plan, including the development of a "Cultural Cafe"; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121790 appropriated $250,000 to begin the build-out of this space; and

 WHEREAS, cost estimates to complete necessary life-safety and building systems enhancements to allow occupancy, but not final programming of the space, require an additional $261,000 above the amount appropriated in Ordinance 121790; and

 WHEREAS, an emergency severe winter shelter for homeless or at-risk persons during nights of inclement/freezing weather was previously provided within the Municipal Building Lobby, then temporarily moved to the Public Safety Building during the construction of Seattle City Hall, and then again displaced due to the Public Safety Building's demolition; and

 WHEREAS, the provision of life-safety and building enhancement work necessary for the occupancy of the space, as part of the long-term development of the space, allows the temporary return of an emergency severe winter shelter to the Seattle City Hall; and

 WHEREAS, the use of this space as an emergency severe winter shelter for homeless or at-risk persons is seen as only a temporary measure and funding for the development of an alternative location for this type of shelter is authorized by this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the Human Services Department has issued a Request for Proposals for shelter services and is currently awaiting responses, which could identify an alternative location and service provider for a severe winter shelter for homeless or at-risk persons; NOW, THEREFORE,
