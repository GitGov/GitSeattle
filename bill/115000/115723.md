 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.210 is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 4.24.210 Payment or Deferral of Sick Leave Upon Retirement~~in lieu of account~~

 In lieu of the establishment of the account and the crediting thereto of the amount provided in Section 4.24.200, any such member of the City Employees' Retirement System or Health Department employee who has retained membership in the State Retirement System under Ordinance 87017, upon retirement, award of retirement allowance in accordance with Section 13(c) of Ordinance 78441 to a member whose employment with the City has been terminated by layoff, or upon retirement after transfer of such member to another governmental entity under any agreement for merger or consolidation of governmental services between the City and such other governmental entity, as the case may be, may ~~by written request to the head of the City department in which such person is employed~~choose one of the options provided in subsection A with respect to his or her unused and accumulated sick leave, unless such member is subject to the mandatory sick leave deferral provisions in subsection B.

 A. Optional Cash-Out or Deferral for Retirement Income Benefits. The eligible retiring member may by written notice to the head of the City department in which such member is employed, and subject to the provisions of the City of Seattle's Voluntary Deferred Compensation 457 Plan and Trust ("City's 457 Plan and Trust") maintained pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.38.010 and the applicable federal income tax laws and regulations governing the deferral of payments for unused and accumulated sick leave under such plan, elect one of the following two options:  1.

~~elect t~~To receive a lump sum cash payment from the City ~~of an amount~~equal to ~~the amount provided in Section 4.24.200~~twenty-five (25) percent of such member's unused and accumulated sick leave balance, determined at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his or her retirement; or  2. To defer receipt of thirty-five (35) percent of such member's unused and accumulated sick leave balance, determined at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his or her retirement, to the City's 457 Plan and Trust adopted and maintained pursuant to Section 4.38.010

; provided, that:  a. Such deferral election is made before the member retires and while employed by the City in accordance with the City's 457 Plan and Trust;

 b. Such deferral shall be subject to all conditions and limitations of the City's 457 Plan and Trust; and  c. When the deferral of thirty-five (35) percent of the value of the member's unused and accumulated sick leave balance to the City's 457 Plan and Trust adopted and maintained pursuant to Section 4.38.010 would exceed the year-to-date or life-to-date limitations on deferrals and contributions to such account, the member's deferral to the pre-tax deferral account will be automatically reduced to the maximum allowable deferral amount, and the member shall then receive a lump sum taxable cash payment from the City equal to the amount, if any, by which a twenty-five (25) percent cash out payment under subsection A1 for such member exceeds the maximum allowable deferral to under the City's 457 Plan and Trust under subsection A2.

 B. Mandatory Deferral for Health Benefits. If the retiring member is a represented employee covered by an agreement by and between the City and an individual union that is part of the Coalition of City Unions that has been ratified by the employees in the union who are eligible to retire during the term of the agreement and which requires the City to make contributions to the City's duly established Health Reimbursement Arrangement - Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association Program ("HRA-VEBA") as authorized and established under 26. U.S.C. section 501(c)(9) on behalf of all members covered by such agreement who retire during the duration of such agreement, the City shall, following the receipt of a signed hold harmless agreement and membership enrollment form, contribute thirty-five (35) percent of such member's unused sick leave balance, determined at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his or her retirement, to a pre-tax deferral account established and maintained for the benefit of the member under the City's HRA-VEBA Program, to provide reimbursements for qualifying medical care expenses in accordance with the terms of the HRA-VEBA Program and applicable federal income tax laws and regulations. If the retiring member to whom subsection B is applicable fails to submit the signed hold harmless agreement and membership enrollment form by their last working day of employment, the retiring member will forfeit his or her entire unused and accumulated sick leave balance. Under no circumstances shall any retiring member to whom subsection B applies be eligible to elect either of the options provided under subsection A or have the right to receive payment from the City of all or any portion of the value of his or her unused and accumulated sick leave in the form of a cash payment or other taxable or non-taxable benefits.

~~, in the event such member is transferred under any agreement for merger or consolidation of governmental services between the City and another governmental entity, such written request shall be directed to the Executive Secretary of the retirement system.~~

 C. Authorization for Payment. Upon receipt of ~~such~~a written ~~request~~notice from a retiring member pursuant to subsection A, or receipt of a signed hold harmless agreement and membership form from a retiring memberto whom subsection B is applicable, the head of the department in which such person was employed,~~or the Executive Secretary of the retirement system, as the case may be, is authorized to~~shall  pay such amount to or on behalf of such person and for such purpose to use unexpended and unencumbered budget salary funds accumulating in the budget of such department, or such other funds as may be appropriated therefor.

 D. Eligibility Date. Mandatory Deferral for Health Benefits under Section B was previously authorized for the Coalition of City Unions by Ordinance No. 115334 and employees became eligible in accordance with the terms of the City's HRA-VEBA program. Optional Cash-Out or Deferral for Retirement Income Benefits under Section A applies to employees who retire on or after the effective date of this ordinance.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
