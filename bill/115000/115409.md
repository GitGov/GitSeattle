 4. To serve as a model for other neighborhoods, demonstrating housing solutions that could have broader application in other neighborhoods;

 5. To increase the diversity of housing types and levels of affordability to meet the varied needs and goals of a neighborhood.

 B. Scope of Authority to Modify Land Use Code Requirements. Demonstration projects shall be selected and reviewed in accordance with the demonstration program for innovative housing design adopted by Ordinance 119241, as modified and amended by Ordinances 119368, 119784 and 120318.

 3. A maximum of ten (10) projects that include cottage housing, tandem housing or small lot single-family development may be allowed in a single-family zone, contrary to the minimum lot area requirements of SMC Section 23.44.010 and other development standards contained in SMC Chapter 23.44.

 (2) For additional height for accessory structures beyond the twelve (12) feet allowed by SMC Section 23.43.040 A3, when the accessory structure contains a garage with above-garage dwelling units, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent over the maximum allowed by SMC Section 23.43.012 C for principal structures in cottage housing developments; provided that, no height departure may be granted that would result in an accessory structure that is higher than the maximum allowed for single-family structures in single- family zones other than lots zoned residential small lot.

 4. A maximum of six (6) multifamily demonstration projects in a multifamily zone or as a part of a mixed-use development project in a commercial zone outside of downtown, may be granted height departures through the design review process, contrary to SMC Chapter 23.41 which, with one (1) exception, does not allow height departures.

 23.47A.006 Conditional uses.

 A. All conditional uses are subject to the procedures described in Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, and must meet the following criteria:

 1. The use will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located.

 2. In authorizing a conditional use, adverse impacts may

 be mitigated by imposing any conditions needed to protect other properties in the zone or vicinity and to protect the public interest. The Director shall deny or recommend denial of a conditional use if it is determined that adverse impacts cannot be mitigated satisfactorily.

 B. The following uses, identified as administrative conditional uses on Chart A of Section 23.47A.004, may be permitted by the Director when the provisions of this subsection and subsection A are met:

 1. Drinking establishments in NC1 and NC2 zones may be permitted as a conditional use subject to the following conditions or criteria:

 a. The size of the drinking establishment, design of the structure, signing and illumination must be compatible with the character of the commercial area and other structures in the vicinity, particularly in areas where a distinct and definite pattern or style has been established.

 b. The location, access and design of parking must be compatible with adjacent residential zones.

 c. Special consideration will be given to the location and design of the doors and windows of drinking establishments to help ensure that noise standards will not be exceeded. The Director may require additional setbacks and/or restrict openings where the drinking establishment is located on a lot that abuts or is across from a residential zone.

 d. Drinking establishments must not generate traffic that creates traffic congestion or further worsens spillover parking on residential streets.

 2. Park-and-ride lots in NC3, C1 and C2 zones may be permitted as conditional uses subject to the following conditions or criteria:

 a. The park-and-ride lot shall have direct vehicular access to a designated arterial improved to City standards.

 b. If the proposed park-and-ride lot is located on

 a lot containing accessory parking for other uses, there must be no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the park- and-ride lot and other uses on the lot.

 c. Landscaping and screening in addition to that required for surface parking areas, noise mitigation, vehicular access control, signage restrictions, and other measures may be required to provide comfort and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists and to insure the compatibility of the park-and-ride lot with the surrounding area.

 3. Street-level Residential Uses. Residential use along street-level, street-facing facades that exceeds 20% of the width of a facade may be permitted outright, permitted as an administrative conditional use or prohibited as provided by Section 23.47A.004 D. Additions to, or on-site accessory structures for, existing single- family structures are permitted outright. Where residential use along street-level, street-facing facades that exceeds 20% of the width of a facade may be permitted as an administrative conditional use, such a permit may be granted only when the following circumstances exist:

 a. Due to location or parcel size, the proposed site is not suited for commercial development; or

 b. There is substantial excess supply of land available for commercial use near the proposed site, evidenced by such conditions as a lack of commercial activity in existing commercial structures for a sustained period, commercial structures in disrepair, and vacant or underused commercially zoned land; provided that development with residential use along street-level, street-facing facades that exceeds 20% of the width of a facade shall not interrupt an established commercial street front. As used in this subsection, the phrase "established commercial street front" may include a street front intersected by streets or alleys, and some lots with no current commercial use.

 4. Residential Uses in C2 zones

 a. Residential Uses may be permitted in C2 Zones as a conditional use subject to the following criteria:

 (1) The residential use should generally not be located in an area with direct access to major transportation systems such as freeways, state routes and freight rail lines.

 (2) The residential use should generally not be located in close proximity to industrial areas and/or nonresidential uses that have the potential to create a nuisance or adversely affect the desirability of the area for living purposes as indicated either by their prohibition in the NC3 zone or their classification as a Major Noise Generator or their classification as a Major Odor Source.

 (3) In making a determination to permit or prohibit residential uses in C2 zones, the Director shall take the following factors into account:

 (a) The distance between the site in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisances;

 (b) The presence of physical buffers between the site in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisance uses;

 (c) The potential cumulative impacts of residential uses on the availability for nonresidential uses of land near major transportation systems; and

 (d) The number, size and cumulative impacts of potential nuisances on the proposed residential uses.

 b. Residential uses required to obtain a shoreline conditional use are not required to obtain an administrative conditional use.

 c. Additions to, or on-site accessory structures for, existing residential structures are permitted outright.

 5. Medical service uses over ten thousand (10,000) square feet, outside but within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of a medical Major Institution overlay district boundary, are subject to administrative conditional use approval, unless included in an adopted master plan or dedicated to veterinary services. In making a determination whether to approve or deny a medical service use, the Director must determine whether an adequate supply of commercially zoned land for businesses serving neighborhood residents will continue to exist. The following factors will be used in making this determination:

 a. Whether the amount of medical service use development existing and proposed in the vicinity would result in an area containing a concentration of medical services with few other uses; and

 b. Whether medical service use development would displace existing neighborhood-serving commercial uses at street level or disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of retail and personal services uses, or significantly detract from

 an area's overall neighborhood-serving commercial character.

 6. Change of One Nonconforming Use to Another. A nonconforming use may be converted by an administrative conditional use authorization to a use not otherwise permitted in the zone based on the following factors:

 a. New uses are limited to those first permitted in the next more intensive zone;

 b. The relative impacts of size, parking, traffic, light, glare, noise, odor and similar impacts of the two (2) uses, and how these impacts could be mitigated.

 c. The Director must find that the new nonconforming use is no more detrimental to property in the zone and vicinity than the existing nonconforming use.

 7. Principal use parking may be authorized on a temporary basis as an administrative conditional use, except in pedestrian designated zones (P1 or P2) or within the Station Area Overlay District, under the circumstances described in subsection (a) below, subject to the conditions of subsection (b).

 a. Eligible circumstances:

 (1) Principal use parking is not permitted in the zone; and

 (2) An existing surface parking area or structure has been used to provide accessory parking, and the use to which the parking was accessory has been discontinued; or

 (3) The site has been cleared pursuant to an active permit authorizing construction and commencement of a new use on the property; or.

 (4) Development of the site, including what is to become accessory surface or structured parking, is partially complete, but the use to which the parking is to be accessory has not yet been commenced.

 b. Conditions.

 (1) The permit may be issued for a two (2) year period. At the expiration of that period, the permit may be renewed for a maximum of two (2) additional years; and

 (2) Exterior lighting and vehicle lights shall be shielded or screened to minimize glare affecting nearby uses.

 C. The following uses, identified as Council Conditional Uses on Chart A of Section 23.47A.004, may be permitted by the Council when the provisions of this subsection and subsection A of this section are met.

 5. Fences, freestanding walls and other similar structures.

 a. Fences, freestanding walls and other similar structures six (6) feet or less in height above existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, are permitted in required setbacks. The six (6) foot height may be averaged along sloping grade for each six (6) foot long segment of the fence, but in no case may any portion of the fence exceed eight (8) feet.

 b. Bulkheads and retaining walls used to raise grade may be placed in any required setback when limited to six (6) feet in height, measured above existing grade. A guardrail no higher than forty-two (42) inches may be placed on top of a bulkhead or retaining wall existing as of the date of the ordinance codified in this section. If a fence is placed on top of a new bulkhead or retaining wall, the maximum combined height is limited to nine and one-half (9 1/2) feet.

 c. Bulkheads and retaining walls used to protect a cut into existing grade may not exceed the minimum height necessary to support the cut or six (6) feet, whichever is greater.

 A. Landscaping.

 1. Landscaping is required in an amount equal to five (5) percent of lot area for new construction on any vacant lot. Landscaping, screening, and other features otherwise required by this chapter can be counted toward this requirement. The landscaping must be in a location that is visible to pedestrians or customers and that has adequate sunlight and space necessary to ensure plant survival.

 2. Landscaping must meet standards promulgated by the Director.

 3. The Director may reduce or waive the amount of landscaping required based on one or more of the following:

 a. No usable space for landscaping is present between the proposed new structure and existing structures on adjoining lots because of inadequate sunlight or inadequate width;

 b. No setback is provided in front of the new structure;

 c. Landscaping in the rear would not be visible to pedestrians or customers;

 d. Planter boxes in the right-of-way are not feasible due to narrow sidewalks or other potential for pedestrian conflict.

 B. Street Trees.

 1. Street trees are required according to the rules promulgated by the Director of Transportation. Existing street trees can be counted toward this requirement.

 2. Exceptions to Street Tree Requirements.

 a. If a lot borders a platted but unopened street, the Director may reduce or waive the street tree requirement along that platted street if after consultation with the Director of Transportation it is determined that the street is unlikely to be developed.

 b. Street tree requirements do not apply to single-family dwelling units in commercial zones.

 c. Street trees are not required when a change of use is the only permit requested.

 d. Street trees are not required for temporary use permits.

 e. Street trees are not required when expanding an

 existing structure unless an expansion equal to or greater than one thousand (1,000) square feet is proposed. Two (2) street trees are required for each additional one thousand (1,000) square feet of expansion up to the maximum number required according to the rules promulgated by the Director of Transportation.

 f. Street trees are not required when an existing surface parking area is expanded by less than ten (10) percent in area or in number of spaces.

 g. If street trees would obscure the visibility of retail uses or obstruct pedestrian access to retail uses, and there is no other location on the lot for the landscaping, the Director may reduce or waive the street tree requirement after consultation with the City Arborist.

 3. If it is not feasible to plant street trees according to City standards, either a five (5) foot deep landscaped setback is required along the street property line or landscaping other than trees may be located in the planting strip according to the rules promulgated by the Director of Transportation. The street trees shall be planted in the landscaped area at least two (2) feet from the street lot line if they cannot be placed in the planting strip. The Director may reduce or waive this setback and tree requirement in front of entrances to retail sales and service uses or where the setback and tree requirement is physically infeasible to meet.

 C. Screening.

 1. Required screening must be provided along street property lines as follows:

 a. A fence or wall according to the height specified in subsection D; or

 b. A hedge or landscaped berm according to the height specified in subsection D.

 2. Required landscaped areas and berms must meet rules promulgated by the Director. Features such as pedestrian access meeting the Seattle Building Code, Chapter 11 -- Accessibility, decorative pavers, sculptures or fountains may cover a maximum of thirty (30) percent of each required landscaped area or berm.

 D. Requirements for Specific Uses. When there is more than one use that requires screening or landscaping, the requirement that results in the greater amount applies.

 1. Surface Parking.

 a. Landscaping is required as follows:

 Number of Parking Spaces Required Landscaped Area

 20 to 50 18 square feet/ parking space

 51 to 99 25 square feet/ parking space

 100 or more 35 square feet/ parking space

 (1) The landscaped area shall be no smaller than one hundred (100) square feet.

 (2) No part of a landscaped area shall be less than four (4) feet in any dimension except those parts created by turning radii or angles of parking spaces.

 (3) No stall shall be more than sixty (60) feet from a required landscaped area.

 (4) Native or non-invasive groundcover shall be planted in accordance with rules promulgated by the Director.

 b. Trees.

 (1) One (1) tree shall be required for every ten (10) parking spaces.

 (2) Each tree shall be three (3) feet away from any curb of a landscaped area or edge of the parking area. Permanent curbs or structural barriers must enclose each landscaped area.

 (3) Trees in parking areas shall be selected in consultation with the City Arborist.

 c. Screening.

 (1) All surface parking lots shall have screening at least three (3) feet high along the street property lines.

 (2) Surface parking abutting or across an alley from a lot in a residential zone must have at least six (6) foot high screening along the abutting lot line(s) and a minimum five (5) foot deep landscaped area inside the screening (see Exhibit 23.47A.016 A).

 d. The Director may reduce or waive these requirements for the following reasons:

 (1) to improve safety;

 (2) to provide adequate maneuvering room for service vehicles;

 (3) to prevent the number of parking spaces from being reduced to fewer than the required number; or

 (4) when required parking only can be provided at the rear lot line and the alley is necessary to provide aisle space.

 e. In making the determination to waive or reduce the landscaping and screening requirements, the Director shall consider whether:

 (1) The lot width and depth permit a workable plan for the building and parking that would preserve the screening and landscaping;

 (2) The character of use across the alley, such as multifamily parking structures, makes the screening and landscaping less necessary;

 (3) The property is located in a pedestrian- designated zone and therefore access to parking from the street is not feasible or is undesirable; and

 (4) A topographic break between the alley and the residential zone makes screening less necessary.

 2. Parking in Structures.

 a. When parking occupies any portion of a street- level facade of a structure between a height of five (5) feet and eight (8) feet above sidewalk grade, there shall be a landscaped area at least five (5) feet deep along street lot lines in front of the portion of the structure containing the parking. In addition, the parking must be screened by:

 (1) The facade of the structure; or

 (2) At least six (6) foot high screening between the structure and the landscaped area (Exhibit 23.47A.016 B).

 b. A minimum five (5) foot deep landscaped area is required along all property lines abutting residentially zoned lots for any portion of a structure that contains parking that is not screened from the residential zone by the exterior wall of the

 structure. At ground level, the setback must be landscaped according to subsection 23.47A.016 C3 and at least six (6) foot high screening along the abutting property line(s) must be provided.

 c. When access is through a street-facing facade, the facade can contain no more than one (1) garage door, not to exceed the maximum width allowed for the curbcut.

 d. An opaque screen at least three and one-half (3 1/2) feet high is required along the perimeter of each floor of parking that is eight (8) feet or more above sidewalk grade.

 1. In the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District certain uses are subject to a maximum parking ratio pursuant to Section 23.74.010 A.1.b. When there are multiple uses on a lot, the total parking requirement for all uses subject to the maximum ratio cannot exceed that maximum.

 2. In all commercial zones, no more than one hundred forty-five (145) spaces may be provided as surface parking per lot.

 C. Exceptions to the parking requirements set forth in this section are provided in Section 23.54.020, Parking quantity exceptions, unless otherwise specified.

 D. In all zones, no parking is required for the first two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area of nonresidential uses in a structure. This waiver does not apply to structures or portions of structures occupied by restaurants with drive-in lanes, motion picture theaters, administrative offices or institutional uses, including Major Institution uses. When two or more uses, with different parking ratios occupy a structure, the twenty-five (2,500) square foot waiver is prorated based on the area occupied by the nonresidential uses for which the parking waiver is permitted.

 E. Parking waivers in pedestrian-designated zones.

 1. In pedestrian-designated zones, the minimum number of off-street parking spaces is calculated according Charts A through C and reductions are permitted pursuant to Section 23.54.020. Further reductions may be permitted for the uses listed on Chart D. The parking waivers permitted in Chart D apply to each business establishment in a structure.

 2. Additional parking waivers may be permitted as a special exception for the following uses:

 a. Eating and drinking establishments, up to a maximum waiver of five thousand (5,000) square feet; and

 b. Motion picture theaters, up to a maximum waiver of three hundred (300) seats.

 3. The following factors will be considered by the Director in determining whether to permit additional parking waivers:

 a. Anticipated parking demand for the proposed use;

 b. The extent to which an additional parking waiver is likely to create or add significantly to spillover parking in adjacent residential areas;

 c. The availability of shared parking within eight hundred (800) feet of the business; and

 d. Whether land is available for parking without demolishing an existing commercial structure, displacing a commercial use, or rezoning property to commercial.

 F. Off-street parking shall be provided for all fleet vehicles and those parking spaces will not be counted toward the parking requirements of Chart A, Chart B, or Chart C.

 G. For nonschool uses permitted to locate in a former or existing public school by a School Use Advisory Committee (SUAC), parking requirements will be determined by the school use criteria, according to Chapter 23.78, Establishment of Criteria for Joint Use or Reuse of Schools.

 H. In the case of a use not shown on Chart A, Chart B, or Chart C, the requirements for off-street parking will be determined by the Director. If there is more than one comparable use, the Director's determination will be based on the requirements for the most comparable use. Where, in the judgment of the Director, none of the uses on Chart A, Chart B, and Chart C are comparable, the Director may base his or her determination as to the amount of parking required for the proposed use on detailed information provided by the applicant. The information required may include, but not be limited to, a description of the physical structure(s), identification of potential users, and analysis of likely parking demand.

 I. If an entire use or structure, or the same portion of a use or structure, falls under more than one category in Chart A, Chart B or Chart C then, unless otherwise specified, the category requiring the least amount of parking spaces applies.

 J. Existing legal parking deficits of legally established uses are allowed to continue even if a change of use occurs. This subsection will not be construed to permit a parking deficit caused by the failure to satisfy conditions of a reduced parking requirement for any use or structure.

 K. Bicycle Parking. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces for bicycles required for specified uses is set forth in Chart E. In the case of a use not shown on Chart E, there is no minimum bicycle parking requirement. The minimum requirements are based upon gross floor area of the use in a structure, or the square footage of the use when located outside of an enclosed structure, or as otherwise specified.

 1. After the first fifty (50) spaces for bicycles are provided, additional spaces are required at one half (1/2) the ratio shown in Chart E, except for Rail transit facilities; Passenger terminals; and Park and Ride lots. Spaces within dwelling units or on balconies do not count toward the bicycle parking requirement.

 2. Required bicycle parking shall be provided in a safe, accessible and convenient location. Bicycle parking hardware shall be installed so that it can perform to its manufacturer's specifications and Seattle Department of Transportation design criteria, allowing

 adequate clearance for bicycles and their riders. Directional signage shall be installed when bike parking facilities are not clearly visible from the street or sidewalk. When any covered automobile parking is provided, all required long-term bicycle parking shall be covered. When located off-street, bicycle and automobile parking areas must be separated by a barrier or painted lines.

 3. Long-term parking for bicycles shall be for bicycles parked four (4) hours or more. Short-term parking for bicycles shall be for bicycles parked less than four (4) hours.

 4. Bicycle parking facilities accessory to nonresidential uses shall be located on the lot or in a shared bicycle parking facility within one hundred (100) feet of the lot, except as provided in subsection 7 below.

 5. Bicycle parking accessory to residential uses must be located on-site.

 6. Bicycle parking facilities shared by more than one use

 are encouraged.

 7. Bicycle parking may be located in a separate facility within one-hundred (100) feet of the lot that is not a shared bicycle parking facility, or the applicant may make a payment to the City to fund public bicycle parking in lieu of providing required on-site bicycle parking, if the Director determines that:

 a. Safe, accessible and convenient bicycle parking accessory to a nonresidential use cannot be provided on-site or in a shared bicycle parking facility within one-hundred (100) feet of the lot, without extraordinary physical or financial difficulty;

 b. The payment is comparable to the cost of providing the equivalent bicycle parking on-site, and takes into consideration the cost of materials, equipment and labor for installation;

 c. The bicycle parking funded by the payment is located within sufficient proximity to serve the bicycle parking demand generated by the project; and

 d. Construction of the bicycle parking funded by the payment is assured before issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development.

During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring events, the best available good faith estimate of event duration will be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be fifty (50) percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at the rate of one (1) space for each ten (10) fixed seats of certified projected attendance.

If the Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of fifty (50) percent or less of the seating capacity is based on satisfactory evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket sales, the Director shall, within fifteen (15) days of such submittal, notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change. The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded.
