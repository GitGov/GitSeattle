 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Mercer Corridor Project; authorizing the Director of Transportation to acquire all of the property rights necessary for reconstructing the existing Mercer Street/Valley Street couplet with a widened two-way Mercer Street and a reduction of lanes on Valley Street between Interstate 5 (I-5) and Dexter Avenue; and authorizing acquisition of real property rights within the area bounded by Aloha Street on the north and Republican Street on the south through negotiation and use of eminent domain (condemnation); and authorizing payment of all other costs associated with the acquisition.

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan, developed in 1999, envisions a community characterized by a pervasive friendly ambience, variety of open spaces, and an aesthetically pleasing, safe neighborhood embracing dynamic opportunities for people to work, live and recreate with the greatest ease of mobility for all travel modes; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30610 in 2003 setting forth priorities to support redevelopment of the South Lake Union area including making transportation improvements to reconnect the South Lake Union street grid and promoting connections with downtown and the Seattle Center, and promoting pedestrian-oriented improvements; and

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 30610, the Seattle City Council affirmed its commitment to support the redevelopment of the South Lake Union area as the region's most competitive location for biotech and high-tech research and manufacturing; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30714 in 2004, recommending a two-way Mercer Boulevard and narrowed Valley Street be developed, subject to a Full NEPA Environmental Assessment; and

 WHEREAS, replacing the existing Mercer Street/Valley Street couplet with a widened two-way Mercer Street would provide more direct access to and from I-5, and Mercer Street would be widened approximately sixty (60) feet primarily to the north, and Valley Street would be reduced to a two-lane street with turn lanes, parking and bicycle lanes in each direction; and

 WHEREAS, pedestrian and bicycle circulation would be improved by widening sidewalks and removing barriers caused by the existing couplet, providing additional crossings of Mercer and Valley Streets; and

 Section 2. The Director of Transportation or her designee is authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, to determine which portions and interests of those properties shown on Attachments A and B are necessary to this project and to negotiate and enter into written agreements for and acquire, after payment of just compensation, such real property interests as are necessary for the project and to accept and record deeds and other written instruments on behalf of the City of Seattle by attaching to the instrument the Director's written acceptance thereof, and recording the same.

 Section 3.
