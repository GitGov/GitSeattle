 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use, amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 23.49.011 and 23.49.014 to increase the amount of transferable development rights (TDR) available from a major performing arts facility that qualified for transfer prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443 and to revise provisions for the use of such transferable development rights.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection A of SMC 23.49.011 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), which section was last amended by Ordinance 121278, is amended as follows:

 SMC 23.49.011 Floor area ratio.

 A. General Standards.

 1. The base and maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for each zone is provided in Chart 23.49.011 A.

 2. Chargeable floor area shall not exceed the applicable base FAR except as expressly authorized pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

 a. In DOC1 and DOC2 zones the first one (1) FAR above the base FAR may be gained, at the applicant's option, by any combination of the following: providing one of the amenity features listed in Section 23.49.013, subject to the limits and conditions in that section; providing short-term parking meeting the basic standards in the Public Benefit Features Rule, where such parking is eligible pursuant to Map 1N; providing retail sales and service or entertainment uses as street-level uses meeting the requirements of Section 23.49.025, where such uses are eligible as indicated on Map 1N; or using development rights transferred from an open space TDR site or Landmark TDR site pursuant to Section 23.49.014. An applicant using the option allowed under this subsection A2a may achieve additional chargeable floor area consistent with subsections A2d through A2g of this section.

 b. In the DMC zone chargeable floor area above the base FAR may be achieved, at the applicant's option, by qualifying for bonuses pursuant to Section 23.49.126, Downtown Mixed Commercial, ratios for public benefit features. Such option may be exercised only by election in writing by the applicant as part of the original application for a Master Use Permit, or within sixty (60) days of the effective date of Ordinance 120443, for the project that will use such bonus. An applicant making such election shall not be granted bonus floor area for the lot pursuant to Sections 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, but may use TDR consistent with Section 23.49.014. An applicant making such election thereby also elects to have the optional exemptions under subsection B3 of this section, and not those in subsection B1, apply in determining chargeable floor area.

 c. On lots zoned DOC1 and DMC chargeable floor area above the base FAR may be achieved by using within-block TDR pursuant to Section 23.49.014, Transfer of development rights (TDR), and by meeting the requirements of subsections A2d through A2g of this section.

 d. Except as provided in subsections A2a, A2b, and A2c of this section, additional chargeable floor area above the base FAR may be achieved only by qualifying for bonuses pursuant to Section~~s~~ 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or by the transfer of development rights pursuant to Section 23.49.014, or both, subject to the limits of this chapter and to any other applicable conditions and limitations.

 e. In no event shall the use of bonuses or TDR be allowed to result in chargeable floor area in excess of the maximum as set forth in Chart A, except that a structure on a lot zoned both DOC1 and DMC may exceed the floor area ratio permitted in either zone, provided the chargeable floor area on the lot as a whole does not exceed the combined total permitted chargeable floor area.

 f. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection A2f, not less than five (5) percent of all floor area above the base FAR to be gained on any lot, excluding any floor area gained under subsection A2a or A2c of this Section, shall be gained through the transfer of Landmark TDR, to the extent that Landmark TDR is available. Landmark TDR shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering Landmark TDR for sale, at a price per square foot no greater than the total bonus contribution under Section 23.49.012 for a project using the cash option for both housing and childcare facilities. An applicant may satisfy the minimum Landmark TDR requirement in this section by purchases from private parties, by transfer from an eligible sending lot owned by the applicant, by purchase from the City, or by any combination of the foregoing. This subsection A2f does not apply to any lot in a DMR zone, or to any lot in a DMC zone for which an election has been made under subsection A2b of this section.

 g. On any lot except a lot in a DMR zone or a lot in a DMC zone for which an election has been made under subsection A2b of this section, the total amount of chargeable floor area gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.012, together with any housing TDR used for the same project, shall equal seventy-five (75) percent of the amount, if any, by which the total chargeable floor area to be permitted on the lot exceeds the sum of (i) the base FAR, as determined under this section and Section 23.49.032 if applicable, plus (ii) any chargeable floor area gained on the lot pursuant to subsection A2a or A2c of this section. ~~The~~At least half of the remaining twenty-five (25) percent shall be gained by using TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, to the extent available. The balance of such 25 percent shall be gained through ~~other~~ bonuses  under Section 23.49.013 or through~~other~~ TDR other than housing TDR, or both, consistent with this chapter. TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering such TDR for sale, at a price per square foot not exceeding the prevailing market price for TDR other than housing TDR, as determined by the Director.

 h. In order to gain chargeable floor area on any lot in a DMR zone, an applicant may (i) use any types of TDR eligible under this chapter in any proportions, or (ii) use bonuses under Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or both, subject to the limits for particular types of bonus under Section 23.49.013, or (iii) combine such TDR and bonuses in any proportions.

 i. Bonuses for street-level uses may be allowed only pursuant to subsection A2a or A2b of this section. Bonuses for short-term parking may be allowed only pursuant to subsection A2a of this section. The bonus ratio for street-level uses is three square feet of floor area granted per one square foot (3:1) of bonus feature. The bonus ratio for short-term parking is one (1) square foot of floor area granted per one (1) square foot (1:1) of bonus feature up to a maximum of two hundred (200) parking spaces for above grade parking and is two (2) square feet of floor area granted per one (1) square foot (2:1) of bonus feature for below grade parking up to a maximum of two hundred (200) parking spaces. Ratios and limits for the other features for which a bonus may be granted under subsection A2a are in Section 23.49.013.

 * * *

 Section 2. Subsections E and G of SMC 23.49.014, which section was most recently amended by Ordinance 120967, are amended as follows:

 SMC 23.49.014 Transfer of development rights (TDR).

 * * *

 E. TDR Sales Before Base FAR Increases and Changes in Exemptions.

Except for transfers of TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, ~~T~~transfers of TDR from any lot from which a TDR transfer was made prior to the effective date of ~~the o~~Ordinance ~~codified in this chapter~~120443 are limited to the amount of TDR available from such lot immediately prior to such date.

 * * *

 G. TDR Satisfying Conditions to Transfer Under Prior Code.

1. If the conditions to transfer Landmark TDR, as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443, are satisfied on or before December 31, 2001, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer as determined under the provisions of this Title in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443. If the conditions to transfer ~~of~~ housing TDR ~~or TDR from Major Performing Arts Facilities~~ are satisfied prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443 under the provisions of this Title then in effect, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer immediately prior to that effective date. If the conditions to transfer TDR from a major performing arts facility are satisfied prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443 under the provisions of this Title then in effect, TDR may be transferred from the sending lotafter that effective date, for use on any receiving lots in zones where housing TDR may be used according to Chart 23.49.014 A, in an amount as determined under subsection B of this section, provided that the cumulative amount of TDR that may be transferred after June 1, 2005 from any sending lot based on the presence of a major performing arts facility is limited to 150,000 square feet.

2. For purposes of this subsection, conditions to transfer include, without limitations, the execution by the owner of the sending lot, and recording in the King County real property records, of any agreement required by the provisions of this Title or the Public Benefit Features Rule in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443, but such conditions do not include any requirement for a master use permit application for a project intending to use TDR, or any action connected with a receiving lot. TDR transferable under this subsection G are eligible either for use consistent with the terms of Section 23.49.011 or for use by projects developed pursuant to permits issued under the provisions of this Title in effect prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443. The use of TDR transferred under this subsection G on the receiving lot shall be subject only to those conditions and limits that apply for purposes of the master use permit decision for the project using the TDR.

 * * *

 Section 3. The City Council finds that prior to August 2001 the Benaroya Hall Music Center site satisfied all the conditions required for the transfer of TDR from a major performing arts facility, so that TDR from such site transferred after the effective date of Ordinance 120443 is eligible for use by downtown projects. This ordinance is intended to continue that eligibility and to modify provisions that prevented the transfer from that site of increased base floor area allowed in the DOC 1 zone by Ordinance 120443.

 Section 4. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2005.
