 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter contained and for the benefit of the City, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Such amounts coming due are sometimes referred to hereinafter as the "payments described in Section 3." The schedules of the sources, amounts, maturities, and interest rates or yields of the Escrow Obligations and of the Defeased Bonds that will fulfill the foregoing requirements are set forth in the Verification.

 Section 4 . Collection of Proceeds of Escrow Obligations and Application of Such Proceeds and Money. The Defeasance Trustee shall present for payment and shall collect and receive on the due dates thereof the maturing installments of the principal of and the interest on the Escrow Obligations and any Substitute Obligations (defined hereinafter). The Defeasance Trustee shall make payments, but only in the amounts received pursuant to this section, in a timely manner to the Fiscal Agent of the State of Washington (the "Fiscal Agent") of the amounts to be paid on the Defeased Bonds as shown in the Verification. Those payments shall be made by check, wire transfer, or such other method of transfer of funds as shall be agreed upon by the Defeasance Trustee and the Fiscal Agent.

 Section 5 . Notice of Defeasance/Notice of Redemption. The Defeasance Trustee agrees to give a notice of defeasance of the Defeased Bonds and a notice of redemption of the Defeased Bonds pursuant to the terms of the Defeased Bonds, and in substantially the forms attached hereto as and as described in Exhibits B and C, to the Fiscal Agent for distribution as described therein. The notice of defeasance shall be given with respect to each series of Defeased Bonds immediately following the execution of this Agreement and execution of each Addendum. The notice of redemption shall be given in accordance with the 2003 Bond Legislation. The cost of giving the notice shall be paid by the City.

 Section 6 . All Obligations and Money and Proceeds Thereof Held in Trust. The Defeasance Trustee irrevocably agrees to hold the Escrow Obligations, the Substitute Obligations, if any, the principal thereof and interest thereon, and any other money it may receive pursuant to this Agreement and any reinvestments thereof made pursuant to Sections 8 and 9 hereof, in trust and separate at all times from all other funds and investments held by the Defeasance Trustee, solely for the purpose of making the payments described in Section 3. The City irrevocably conveys, transfers, and assigns to the Defeasance Trustee the Escrow Obligations, any Substitute Obligations, the principal thereof and the interest thereon, and any other money and investments deposited with the Defeasance Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, for the purpose of making such payments. The Defeasance Trustee shall not sell, transfer, assign, or hypothecate any Escrow Obligations, reinvestments, or Substitute Obligations except pursuant to Sections 8, 9, 14 and 15 hereof.

 Section 7 . Reports and Notice of Insufficiency. The Defeasance Trustee shall submit a report to the City, at least semiannually, which report shall set forth the cash, Escrow Obligations, and any Substitute Obligations held hereunder by the Defeasance Trustee, the obligations which have matured and amounts received by the Defeasance Trustee by reason of such maturity, the interest earned on such obligations, a list of any investments or reinvestments made by the Defeasance Trustee in other obligations and the interest and/or principal derived therefrom, the amounts paid to the Fiscal Agent, and any other transaction of the Defeasance Trustee pertaining to its duties and obligations as set forth herein.

 If the maturing principal of and interest on the Escrow Obligations, any Substitute Obligations and other money held by the Defeasance Trustee pursuant to this Agreement shall be insufficient or shall be projected to become insufficient at any time in the future to make the payments described in Section 3, the Defeasance Trustee shall give the City prompt notice of such insufficiency or projected insufficiency.

 Section 8 . Substitution of Different Government Obligations or Other Investments. The City reserves the right to substitute from time to time for Escrow Obligations initially purchased in accordance with Section 2 hereof, or for obligations purchased under this section, other noncallable, nonprepayable direct obligations of the United States of America and/or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America as to full and timely payment of principal and interest (the "Substitute Obligations"). Prior to effecting any such substitution, the City shall have obtained at its expense and delivered to the Defeasance Trustee:

 (a) A verification by a nationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm acceptable to the Defeasance Trustee confirming that the maturing principal of and interest on the Substitute Obligations and any remaining Escrow Obligations to be held by the Defeasance Trustee in the defeasance escrow, if paid when due and assuming no reinvestment thereof, together with any other cash then held by the Defeasance Trustee, will be sufficient to carry out the Defeasance Plan and make all remaining payments described in Section 3; and

 (b) An opinion from Foster Pepper PLLC, bond counsel to the City, its successor or other nationally recognized bond counsel to the City, that the disposition and substitution or purchase of such securities, under the statutes, rules, and regulations then in force and applicable to the Bonds, will not cause the interest on the Defeased Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes and that such disposition and substitution or purchase is in compliance with the statutes and regulations applicable to the Defeased Bonds.

 If the verification delivered to the Defeasance Trustee pursuant to Section 8(a) shows that surplus money not needed to make the payments described in Section 3 will result from the sale, transfer, or other disposition of Escrow Obligations and the substitution of Substitute Obligations therefor, that surplus money at the written request of the City shall be released from the trust estate and shall be transferred to the City to be used for any lawful City purpose, subject to any restrictions stated in the opinion of bond counsel required by Section 8(b).

 Section 9 . Reinvestment of Proceeds of Escrow and/or Substitute Obligations. The proceeds (principal and interest) and reinvestment proceeds of any Escrow Obligations and/or Substitute Obligations held by the Defeasance Trustee in accordance with this Agreement, which are not needed within five business days of the receipt thereof to make the payments described in Section 3, shall be reinvested by the Defeasance Trustee, but only upon receipt of written request of the City, on such date of receipt or the next business day. The City shall direct such reinvestment subject to the following conditions:

 (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) below, the proceeds of such Escrow Obligations and/or Substitute Obligations shall be reinvested in Substitute Obligations at a yield that will not cause the composite yield on the defeasance escrow to exceed _________% during its term or such higher yield as may be directed by letter of instructions from the City to the Defeasance Trustee, but if the composite yield on the directed investments made pursuant to this Agreement would exceed _________%, such letter of instructions shall contain a verification of such composite yield and shall be based upon and accompanied by the opinion of Foster Pepper PLLC, bond counsel to the City, its successor, or other nationally recognized bond counsel to the City, approving reinvestment of such proceeds at such higher yield.

 (b) The obligations in which such proceeds are reinvested shall mature in an amount at least equal to their purchase price on the date or dates directed by the City, but not later than the date (as shown by the then most recent certified public accountant verification) the principal thereof is needed to make the payments described in Section 3;

 (c) If such proceeds, together with other funds remaining in trust, are insufficient to reinvest in the smallest denomination of such obligations or are required to be used to make payments described in Section 3 sooner than the shortest maturity available for such obligations, then those proceeds and funds either shall be converted to United States currency and retained or shall remain uninvested in the defeasance escrow and carried on the books of the Defeasance Trustee until required to make the payments described in Section 3, or until sufficient money is accumulated to permit the investment thereof; and

 (d) "Yield," as used in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the Escrow Obligations and Substitute Obligations, means that yield computed in accordance with and permitted by the Code applicable to the Defeased Bonds and the trust under this Agreement so as to preserve the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on the Defeased Bonds.

 The Defeasance Trustee may make any and all investments permitted by the provisions of this Section through its own investment department or the investment departments of any of its affiliates.

 Section 10 . Amendments to Agreement. The Defeasance Trustee and the City recognize that the owners of the Defeased Bonds from time to time have a beneficial interest in the Escrow Obligations, the Substitute Obligations, and money to be held by the Defeasance Trustee as herein provided. Therefore, this Agreement and any Addendum are irrevocable and shall not be subject to amendment except for the purpose of clarifying any ambiguity herein, increasing the protection of the rights of the owners of the Defeased Bonds, or preserving the exclusion of the interest on the Defeased Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and only if such amendment is accompanied by an opinion addressed to the City and the Defeasance Trustee from Foster Pepper PLLC, its successor or other nationally recognized bond counsel to the City, to the effect that such change is necessary for one of the above reasons and does not detrimentally affect the owners of the outstanding Defeased Bonds or that it strengthens the protection of the owners of the Defeased Bonds and does not detrimentally affect the owners of the Defeased Bonds. If such amendment affects the amount of money and investments in the escrow account or the application thereof, prior to the amendment's taking effect there also shall be a verification by a nationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm satisfactory to the Defeasance Trustee to the effect that after such amendment the Escrow Obligations, Substitute Obligations, and other money in the escrow account will be sufficient to make the payments described in Section 3. A copy of such verification shall be delivered to the Defeasance Trustee.

 Section 11 . Limitation of Liability of Defeasance Trustee. None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall require the Defeasance Trustee to use or advance its own funds in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder. The Defeasance Trustee shall be under no liability for the payment of interest on any funds or other property received by it hereunder except to the extent the Defeasance Trustee is required by the express terms of this Agreement to invest such funds.

 The Defeasance Trustee's liabilities and obligations in connection with this Agreement are confined to those specifically described herein. The Defeasance Trustee is authorized and directed to comply with the provisions of this Agreement and is relieved from all liability for so doing notwithstanding any demand or notice to the contrary by any party hereto. The Defeasance Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for the sufficiency, correctness, genuineness, or validity of the Escrow Obligations or the Substitute Obligations deposited with it; the performance or compliance by any party other than the Defeasance Trustee with the terms or conditions of any such instruments; or any loss which may occur by reason of forgeries, false representations, or the exercise of the Defeasance Trustee's discretion in any particular manner unless such exercise is negligent or constitutes willful misconduct.

 If any controversy arises between the City and any third person, the Defeasance Trustee shall not be required to determine the same or to take any action in the premises, but it may institute, in its discretion, an interpleader or other proceedings in connection therewith as it may deem proper, and in following either course, it shall not be liable.

 Section 12 . City Deposit of Additional Money. The City agrees that it will deposit with the Defeasance Trustee in time to make the then current scheduled debt service payment the additional money specified in the Defeasance Trustee's notice of insufficiency given pursuant to Section 7 hereof.
