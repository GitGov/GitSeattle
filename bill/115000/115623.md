 Exhibit A: Assignment of Cable Franchise Consent Agreement between the City of Seattle and WaveDivision Holdings, L.L.C and WaveDivision V, L.L.C. June 7, 2006 Version #1

 EXHIBIT A: ASSIGNMENT OF CABLE FRANCHISES CONSENT AGREEMENT

 This Agreement is entered into effective as of the Effective Date (as defined in Recital D below), by and among WaveDivision V, L.L.C., a Washington limited liability company ("WaveV"), WaveDivision Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("WaveDivision") and the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("City").

 RECITALS

 A. The City and Millennium Digital Media Systems, L.L.C. ("Millennium") are parties to cable franchises authorized under Ordinances 117955 and 118361, as amended, and as transferred to Millennium under Ordinance 119295 (collectively, the "Franchises"), whereby the City granted cable television franchises to Millennium to construct, maintain and operate a cable television system in certain cable franchise districts in Seattle.

 B. On February 8, 2006, Millennium (and its affiliates) and WaveDivision entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement ("Unit Purchase Agreement") whereby Millennium agreed to contribute the cable system facilities and other assets within the City that Millennium owns and operates pursuant to the Franchises (the "Cable System") to WaveV, a limited liability company that will be formed by and initially owned by Millennium, and immediately after such contribution Millennium shall sell to WaveDivision all of the membership interests of WaveV.

 C. Section 14 of the Franchises and Subsection 21.60.520 of the Seattle Municipal Code provide that neither a cable franchise nor a cable system operated thereunder may be transferred to another person without the approval of the City. The transactions described in the Unit Purchase Agreement each constitute a "Transfer" as that term is defined in the Franchises.

 D. On February 10, 2006, Millennium and WaveDivision submitted an application (the "Application") for the City's consent to the transfer of the Franchises from Millennium to WaveV and the sale of all of the membership interests of WaveV from Millennium to WaveDivision (the transfer and sale are referred to herein collectively as the "Assignment" and the date on which the Assignment is consummated is referred to herein as the "Effective Date"). Following the receipt of the additional information, the City deemed the Application complete on April 10, 2006.

 E. On ___________, 2006, the Seattle City Council adopted the ordinance introduced as Council Bill _______ (Ordinance __________) conditionally approving the Assignment subject to execution of this Agreement by WaveV and WaveDivision.

 In consideration of the approval of the Assignment and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 AGREEMENTS

 1. Consent. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, City consents to the Assignment as specified in the Application. The parties agree that the City acted on the Application in a timely manner under federal law. This Agreement shall be null and void if a duly authorized officer or agent of WaveV fails to deliver the notice required pursuant to Section 4.8 in a timely manner.

 2. Reservation of Rights. The City reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. In particular, and without limitation:

 2.1. Neither this Agreement, nor any other action or omission by the City at or before the execution of this Agreement, shall be construed to grant the City's consent to any future transfer of the Franchises or the cable system, and/or change in ownership and/or control of WaveV or WaveDivision, or to mean that the City's consent to any future transaction that is required by the Franchises is otherwise not required.

 2.2. As a result of the Assignment, the City waives none of its rights with respect to Millennium's compliance with the terms, conditions, requirements and obligations set forth in the Franchises and Title 21, Chapter 21.60, of the Seattle Municipal Code (the "Franchise Documents"), including the City's right to compel Millennium or its successors in interest to comply with the provisions of the Franchise Documents. The City's approval of the Application shall in no way be deemed a representation by the City that Millennium or its successors in interest are in compliance with all of its obligations under the Franchise Documents; provided however, the City will look initially to WaveV and WaveDivision for full performance of all the obligations under the Franchise Documents from and after the Effective Date.

 3. Compliance with Franchise.

 3.1 As of the Effective Date, WaveV hereby accepts, acknowledges, and agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions of the Franchise Documents and to assume all current and future commitments, duties, liabilities and obligations of Millennium thereunder. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that neither the Assignment nor the City's consent thereto shall diminish or otherwise effect Millennium's or WaveV's commitments, duties, liabilities and obligations embodied in the Franchise Documents except as may be expressly provided herein.

 3.2. As of the Effective Date, WaveV agrees to comply with all provisions of the Franchises and all applicable provisions of the City's Municipal Code and federal and state law, to the maximum extent required by law.

 3.3. As of the Effective Date, WaveDivision agrees that it shall cause the Grantee (as defined by SMC Chapter 21.60) to fully comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Franchise Documents and this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the provision of books and records as required by the Franchise Documents and federal and state law, regardless of whether those books and records are maintained by WaveV, WaveDivision or an affiliate.

 3.4. WaveV agrees that neither the Assignment nor the City's approval of the Application shall in any respect relieve the Grantee of responsibility for past acts or omissions, known or unknown. The City hereby confirms to WaveV and WaveDivision that to the best of its knowledge the only defaults, deficiencies or breaches of the Franchises are described in Section 3.7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, due to the number and type of violations found during the preliminary technical audit discussed in Section 3.7, the City believes that there are more widespread technical violations relating to the cable system and will proceed with conducting a more comprehensive technical audit of the cable system as part of the transfer process.

 3.5 WaveV, while it or its affiliates hold the Franchises, agrees to provide monthly Internet service at no cost to (i) those community technology sites required under the Franchises and which are otherwise set to expire as of December 31, 2006, and (ii) such other community technology sites mutually agreed to in writing by the City and WaveV; provided the number of other community technology sites designated pursuant to clause (ii) hereof shall not exceed fifty (50) different locations and WaveV shall not unreasonably disagree regarding sites proposed by the City to be served. Complimentary Internet service shall consist of (i) a line extension to the building; (ii) one drop to a room specified by the organization; (iii) technical and customer service support to ensure the service and equipment is in working order; and (iv) static IP addresses as requested. Complimentary Internet service shall be installed and activated within 30 days of a request from the City unless an alternative schedule is mutually agreed upon. In addition, WaveV agrees to engage in good faith discussions with the City regarding the provision of technology training support / classes at City-sponsored community technology sites; provided that any support to be contributed by WaveV shall be only as mutually agreed in writing by WaveV and the City.

 3.6 WaveV, while it or their affiliates hold the Franchises, agrees to continue to provide a discount on cable services and related equipment to subscribers with low incomes as required by the Franchises and Ordinance 121458. WaveV acknowledges that cable service discounts will be one element of negotiations during the franchise renewal process for the Franchises that are due to expire in 2008.

 3.7 The City has discovered as a result of the spot testing recently performed by Columbia Telecommunications Corporation ("Columbia"), a copy of which test results are attached hereto as Attachment I, that the Cable System does not meet certain technical qualifications as required under the Franchises and federal law and the City has formally notified Millennium of the technical and other outstanding violations in a Notice from the City to Millennium dated May 22, 2006. The City understands that the correction of these technical and other deficiencies may not be completed prior to the Effective Date and, accordingly, the City specifically (i) reserves the right to compel Millennium or its successors in interest to correct franchise violations including the technical deficiencies identified by Columbia and the City as described in the Notice from the City to Millennium dated May 22, 2006, and (ii) requires that WaveV implement a sweep of the cable system immediately following the Effective Date to uncover any technical or safety violations under applicable federal or local laws and regulations and to take appropriate corrective action. In addition, WaveV shall reimburse the City for one-half of the reasonable cost and expense, including all outside legal and testing costs, related (i) to the additional testing of the technical facets of the Cable System by Columbia or other qualified technical review specialists and (ii) to the re- testing of the technical facets of the Cable System which were found to be deficient as of the date hereof or are found to be deficient at a later date; provided that WaveV's reimbursement obligation for such services shall not exceed $25,000. WaveV's failure to correct the technical deficiencies or take corrective action as outlined above shall be considered a material breach of its Franchises subject to the remedies provided therein.

 4. Guaranty.

 4.1. Obligations Guaranteed. In consideration of the City's approval of the Assignment, WaveDivision hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and faithful performance by WaveV of all of the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements contained in the Franchises and this Agreement subject to Applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, "Applicable Law" shall mean any law, statute, charter, ordinance, rule, regulation, code, license, certificate, franchise, permit, writ, ruling, award, executive order, directive, requirement, injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), judgment, decree or other order which has been issued, executed, entered and deemed applicable to City, either specifically or by reference to a class including City, by any court of competent jurisdiction or other federal or state department, commission, board or agency.

 4.2. Representations and Warranties. WaveV and WaveDivision hereby represent and warrant that:

 A. WaveDivison has investigated fully whether any benefit or advance will inure to WaveDivision by reason of the execution of this Agreement, and has determined that a direct or indirect benefit will inure to WaveDivision by reason of the execution of this Agreement.

 B. This Agreement is a legal, valid and binding agreement of WaveV and WaveDivision that is enforceable in accordance with its terms.

 C. The Franchises are legal, valid and binding and enforceable against WaveV in accordance with their terms, subject to Applicable Law.

 D. The financial statements of WaveDivision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005, heretofore delivered to the City are true and correct in all material respects, and fairly present the financial position or results of operations, as the case may be, for the periods or as of the dates indicated on such statements, and no material adverse change has occurred in the financial condition of WaveDivision since the date thereof.

 E. WaveV and WaveDivision each has the full right, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, and to perform the undertakings contained herein and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all corporate or other action necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the performance of the undertakings contained herein and the transactions contemplated hereby, have been taken.

Unless in a writing signed by the City and WaveDivision, no exercise or nonexercise by the City of any right given it by this Agreement, no dealing by the City with WaveV or any other guarantor, endorser or any other person, and no change, impairment, release or suspension of any right or remedy of the City shall in any way affect any of the obligations of WaveDivision hereunder. If the City has now exculpated or hereafter exculpates WaveV from liability in whole or in part other than in a writing signed by WaveV and/or WaveDivision, such exculpation and agreement shall not affect the obligations of WaveDivision under this Agreement, it being understood that WaveDivision's obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of WaveV and are to be construed as if no such exculpation or agreement had been given to WaveV by the City. WaveDivision further acknowledges and agrees that if any such exculpation or agreement has been given by the City in a writing signed by WaveV, the City has done so in reliance upon the agreements of WaveDivision expressed herein. In any action by the City to enforce this Agreement against WaveDivision, WaveDivision shall bear the burden of establishing the existence and terms of such a written exculpation of WaveV and/or WaveDivision by the City.

 4.4 Waivers by WaveDivision. WaveDivision hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any and all defenses to enforcement of this Agreement including without limitation (a) any right to require the City, as a condition precedent or concurrent to enforcement of this Agreement, to proceed against WaveV or any other person or to pursue any other right or remedy in the City's power before proceeding against WaveDivision; (b) notice of the acceptance of this Agreement by any person; (c) demand, notice of default or nonpayment, presentment, protest, and all other notices of any kind to which WaveDivision might otherwise be entitled in connection with this Agreement, including, but not limited to, notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional obligations or of any action or nonaction on the part of WaveV; (d) any defense based upon an election of remedies by the City or any other act, actions, or failure to act by or on behalf of the City which destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of WaveDivision or the right of WaveDivision to proceed against WaveV for reimbursement, or both, including any defense available to WaveDivision to a deficiency judgment arising from the destruction of WaveDivision's subrogation rights; (e) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that an offer of performance exonerates a surety; (f) any defense arising because of the City's election, in any proceeding instituted under the federal Bankruptcy Code, or the Application or Section 1111(b)(2) of the federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended; and (g) any defense under Section 364 of the federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, it being agreed by WaveDivision that the failure of the City to exercise any rights or remedies it has or may have against WaveV shall in no way impair the obligation of such Agreement and that the liability of WaveDivision hereunder is and shall be direct and unconditional.

 4.5. Independent Investigation by WaveDivision. WaveDivision understands and agrees that WaveDivision is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of WaveV and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of nonperformance of any obligations hereby guaranteed.

 4.6. Remedies Cumulative. Except as expressly provided, all rights, power and remedies of the City hereunder shall be cumulative and not alternative and such rights, powers and remedies shall be in addition to all rights, powers and remedies given to the City by law. This guaranty is in addition to and exclusive of the guaranty of any other guarantor of any obligations of WaveV to the City.

 4.7. Actions. The obligations of WaveDivision hereunder are independent obligations of WaveDivision and, in the event of any default hereunder, a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against WaveDivision, whether or not WaveV is joined therein or a separate action or actions are brought against WaveV. The City may maintain successive actions for other defaults. This Agreement may be enforced by an action against WaveDivision, without the necessity of joining in such action any other WaveDivision obligations guaranteed hereby. The City's rights hereunder shall not be exhausted by exercise of any of its rights or remedies or by any such action or by any number of successive actions until and unless all obligations the performance of which are hereby guaranteed, have been fully performed.

 4.8 Notice Regarding Closing. Within five (5) business days of the Effective Date, WaveV or WaveDivision (if WaveV is not currently in existence) shall notify the City of the pending consummation of the Assignment. At such time, all of the pre-conditions and requirements of this Agreement, if and to the extent such requirements as provided herein or in related Assignment documents are to be executed, met or completed prior to the Effective Date, shall be executed, met or completed.

 4.9 Certificate of Authority for WaveV. Within five (5) business days of the filing of the WaveV Certificate of Formation with the Washington Secretary of State, WaveV or WaveDivision shall notify the City by providing the City with a Washington Certificate of Existence/Authorization for WaveV.

 5. Renewal. Except as specifically provided herein, this Agreement shall not have any effect on the City's authority to enforce the Franchise Documents. Further, this Agreement shall not have any effect on any authority the City may have to review, conditionally approve or deny the renewal of the franchises granted to WaveV. The City expressly reserves its rights to conduct a complete renewal proceeding pursuant to 47 U.S.C. section 546, including but not limited to, conducting a complete review of WaveV's compliance with, and performance under, the Franchises and any other obligation WaveV may have under federal or local law, beginning from the Effective Date through the end of each Franchise term, March 8, 2008, and including, without limitation, any Franchise term extensions thereto up to and including during the franchise renewal process, and to conditionally approve or deny a renewal based on any such failure, noncompliance or violations.

 6. Rates. WaveV and WaveDivision agree that the Assignment will not result in an increase in the rate for basic cable service. Nothing shall prohibit rate increases made in the ordinary course of business in compliance with local, state and federal law that are not caused by the Assignment. WaveV and WaveDivision agree that it will not rely upon an increase in debt service or in debt service coverage, if any, that results from the Assignment to justify an increase in rates for regulated cable services.

 7. PEG Access Financial Support. WaveV acknowledges that financial support for public, education and government (PEG) channels will be one element of negotiations during the franchise renewal process for the Franchises that are due to expire in 2008.

 8. Local Office. As a condition of this Agreement, WaveV agrees to maintain one local office as required by SMC 21.60.820; it being understood and agreed that WaveV's assumption of the pay station agreement (or a successor agreement approved by the City) between the City and Millennium shall serve as an acceptable substitute for a local office.

 9. Representations and Warranties. WaveDivision and WaveV acknowledge and agree that the City's consent to the Assignment is made in reliance upon the written information provided by WaveDivision and WaveV, including but not limited to the Form 394 and supplemental information. WaveDivision and WaveV represent and warrant that the foregoing information and representations are true and accurate, and omit no material information the absence of which would cause the information provided to be materially misleading. WaveDivision and WaveV also represent and warrant that WaveV, upon the consummation of the Assignment, will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of WaveDivision and that at the time of execution of this Agreement each such entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the states in which they were formed, and that they are qualified to do business within the State of Washington.

 10. Franchise Fee Review. WaveV agrees that it will properly calculate and remit to the City the franchise fees in accordance with the Franchises. WaveV also agrees that, absent written notice to the contrary from WaveV, the City will not have to set the franchise fee credit annually by ordinance, as required by Subsection 11.2 of the Franchises, unless it wishes to alter the franchise fee credit from the credit establish by ordinance in 2006.

 11. Enforcement. Any violation of this Agreement shall be deemed a violation of the Franchises subject to the remedies provided in the Seattle Municipal Code as well as other remedies provided by law or in equity. Any action to interpret or enforce any provision in this Agreement, the Franchises or the Seattle Municipal Code may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Washington, and the parties agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of Washington state and federal courts for such purposes. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of Washington.

 12. Authority. Each of the persons executing this Agreement certifies that they are authorized by the respective party to execute this Agreement and to bind that party.

 13. Notices. All notices required or permitted under the Franchise Documents shall be delivered in the manner provided in Section 21.8 of the Franchises, except that the address for the "Grantee" thereunder is hereby changed to the following:

 I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 Columbia Telecommunications Corporation ("CTC") conducted an initial

 inspection of the franchise area served by Millennium Digital Media

 (MDM) in the City of Seattle, Washington on April 18, 2006. This

 report provides an overview of our preliminary findings regarding the

 headend facility, electrical testing of the system at the headend and

 one test point, and inspection of a small portion of the physical

 plant in the area surrounding the test point.

 The initial inspection was limited to a four to five-hour period due

 to prior scheduling conflicts within the Millennium technical

 organization and CTC staff availability. The Millennium staff was

 present and cooperated fully in the inspection process.

 1.1 Adequacy of the Overall Picture Quality

 At the headend and the one test point, all of the analog cable

 channels were inspected for picture quality using a television

 receiver. Quantitative measurements were made on 11 selected

 channels to measure the carrier-to-noise of the channels. The FCC

 has established that a carrier-to-noise ratio of 43 dB be maintained

 as the minimum acceptable value on analog video channels. Of the

 eleven channels measured, only channel 29 (Public Access) failed to

 meet the minimum acceptable value. On channel 29, the measured value

 of the carrier-to-noise was only 41.7 dB at the headend. The average

 value of carrier-to-noise measured for all eleven channels was 51.6

 dB. Section 7.6 of the City's Franchise Agreement with Millennium

 requires the operator to meet or exceed the FCC technical standards.

 At the time of our testing the system did not provide the required

 minimum 43 dB carrier-to-noise required for all channels under the

 FCC rules. There are a number of factors that might play into this

 specific deficiency: 1) the signal at the source or program material

 might have had high noise content, 2) the transmission network from

 the source to the headend could be introducing the noise, and/or 3)

 there may be deficiencies at the headend. We recommend that the

 Millennium technical staff track the source of the noise and perform

 necessary repair or adjustments.

 1.2 Cable Network Physical Plant

 In addition to the system testing, CTC inspected the physical cable

 plant occupying public and private rights-of-ways within several

 blocks of the test point. With regard to the limited area inspected

 on the utility poles, we found the cable plant to be in generally

 acceptable condition in relationship to other cable systems that we

 have inspected, and more specifically, with relationship to the other

 utilities serving the City. There were no obvious problems

 identified, such as hanging cables, or missing cable guy guards.

 However, we did find that there is a significant number of problems

 with regard to the subscriber drop cables inspected.

 We inspected a total of 16 accessible subscriber drop cables in order

 to determine their compliance with prevailing electrical codes.

 Section 9.1 (A) of the Franchise Agreement requires the operator's

 construction practices to be in compliance with the National Electric

 Code (NEC) and the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC). Of this

 limited sample, we found that half of the drops were not compliant

 with the current electrical code. Additional details of these

 violations are provided in Section 4.2.1.

 II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION

 The cable television system in Seattle is one of several systems

 operated in King County and other nearby counties. This headend

 includes equipment to receive, process, and monitor signals for

 transmission to subscribers.

 The system offers many of the analog and digital television channels,

 pay-per-view channels, high-definition television, and high-speed

 data services provided on all cable systems. New technologies, such

 as video on demand (VOD), are centrally controlled. Digital Video

 Recorders (DVR) are not currently supported by this system.

 2.1 Headend

 The headend facility serves as the network control for the cable

 system. A system overview diagram for the network is provided in

[Figure 1: Seattle Cable System Configuration](/~ordpics/115623At1Fig1.gif)

 We found the headend facility to have very limited space. Much of

 the analog video processing equipment is dated and will need to be

 upgraded or replaced. The system still employs antiquated HRC

 technology which offsets the assignment of channels to reduce

 distortion. This technology was used in older, all coaxial cable

 networks that required long amplifier cascades. The new hybrid

 systems using a mix of fiber optic cable and coaxial cable no longer

 require the HRC distortion reduction technology.

 All modulators, signal processors, fiber interface, cable control,

 and other associated equipment is mounted in telecommunications

 equipment racks.

[Figure 2: Analog Channel Signal Processing Equipment ](/~ordpics/115623At1Fig2.gif)

 The facility is centrally air-conditioned and temperature regulated

 to maintain electronic equipment at the desired operating temperature

 independent of outside weather conditions.

 A stand-alone back-up generator has been installed in the headend

 building that automatically goes into operation in the event of

 failure of the commercial power The uninterruptible power supply

 maintains continuous operation of critical equipment in the network

 during the transmission phase between commercial power operation and

 the back-up generator.

 2.2 Distribution System

 The plant distribution system is hybrid fiber-coaxial cable with

 fiber optic nodes and a maximum amplifier cascade of seven, plus the

 optical node. This is an acceptable cascade length under the

 requirements of the Franchise Agreement. However, it is a long

 cascade when compared with systems that have been recently rebuilt.

 Typically, we would be looking at a maximum cascade length of 5

 amplifiers in a newer system. The architecture is a standard design

 for cable systems upgraded in the past few years (see Figure 1 in

 Section 2.1). It is our understanding that there are 2,500 or less

 residential dwelling units passed by the cable plant of each

 individual fiber optic node. The upper system bandwidth is 750 MHz

 providing 700 MHz downstream transmission capacity. The upgraded

 network has unassigned bandwidth that can support additional services

 in the future. The power supplies for the optical nodes are backed-

 up with batteries that are capable of operating the system in the

 absence of external primary power for 3 to 4 hours. Depending on the

 network loading, the battery back-up system installed may not be

 adequate to satisfactorily address the Franchise requirement under

 Section 7.6 (B) for 4 hours of back-up power.

 The power supplies do not have a remote status monitoring system

 which allows the system managers to remotely monitor the battery

 charge level and to alert the operators when power supplies are

 operating in the stand-by mode. This remote monitoring or management

 capability is required in the Franchise Agreement under Section 7.6

 (D).

 2.3 Subscriber Channels

 The MDM Seattle system provides 84 analog channels, 54 digital audio

 channels, and more than 200 digital channels.

 At the time of our inspection, Millennium reported the following

 subscriber base in Seattle:

 Total dwelling units passed 42,931

 Video service subscribers 12,278

 Digital tier subscribers 7,705

 High Speed Data 5,397

 2.4 Emergency Alert System

 The nationwide Emergency Alert System ("EAS") enables authorized

 government authorities to override the programming on a cable system

 to provide emergency information to subscribers. The minimum

 requirements for EAS system operation are outlined in the FCC rules

 and regulations. These regulations detail a testing procedure and

 the documentation required.

 The Seattle Millennium system uses the SAM 921 system (see Figure 3).

 A screen message is displayed on all analog and digital channels,

 except for local off-air channels, which requested that the cable

 operator not override its channels.

 The SAM system provides an EAS message on all analog channels. The

 digital subscriber set-top converters are automatically force-tuned

 to an analog channel to view the EAS message. The EAS equipment is

 programmed to forward only weather, state primary, state, local,

 federal, and required test alerts to the subscriber.

[Figure 3: Emergency Alert System Equipment](/~ordpics/115623At1Fig3.gif)

 The cable operator is required to maintain records documenting the

 FCC-required EAS testing results as well as recent copies of the FCC

 technical performance tests in a Public Reference file that is

 available for review by the general public.

 Section 7.8 (E) of the Franchise Agreement requires that MDM install

 an EAS system that allows the City to override the system to

 communicate to all cable subscribers in time of emergency. MDM

 technical staff claim that the SAM unit meets this requirement. No

 test was made during this inspection period; however, this

 requirement will be examined in more detail in the next phase of our

 inspection activities.

 2.5 Public, Educational, and Government Channels

 The Millennium headend receives programming provided by the PEG

 programmers on dedicated fiber optic transmission links. The

 following PEG programming is carried on the system:

 * Channel 8: KCTS -PBS Educational

 * Channel 21: Government Channel

 * Channel 27: University of Washington -Educational

 * Channel 29: Public Access

 * Channel 32 Seattle Community College - Educational

 * Channel 27: University of Washington (2) -Educational

 * Channel 75: SPS - Educational

 MDM does not carry the KCTS plus channel on the Seattle system. They

 do carry the channel on their King County system, however. We

 recommend that the channel be added to the basic channel line-up

 since it appears to be required under the terms of the Franchise

 Agreement.

 2.6 Cable Modem Service

 Millennium provides cable modem service throughout the Franchise

 area. Nearly half of the cable video subscribers also subscribe to

 the MDM high speed cable modem service.

 III. PERFORMANCE TESTING

 The FCC requires semi-annual Proof-of-Performance ("proof") tests to

 verify the system meets the FCC's minimum technical standards. The

 tests must be performed once in the winter and once in the summer.

 The testing procedures presume that a sample of measurements taken

 for a number of channels at a number of locations across the system

 will be representative of the system as a whole. However, the

 operator is required to have all channels meet the FCC minimum

 technical requirements. The number of channels and locations to be

 tested is determined using an FCC formula based on the number of

 subscribers and the cable system design. Appendix B of this report

 provides full details on the FCC's testing requirements.

 Signal amplitude level tests and subject monitoring tests were

 performed and recorded for all analog channels. Further, the FCC

 requires cable operators to perform a more detailed signal quality

 testing on a select number of analog video channels to provide a

 quantitative measurement of the system performance.

 In cooperation with Millennium technical staff, CTC performed a

 subset of the FCC proof tests at the headend and at one location in

 the City of Seattle. The headend tests were first made to confirm

 that the signals assembled at the headed were properly received and

 processed prior to transmission on the system, and that they were all

 adjusted to the same audio and video carrier levels. Each of the

 analog and a few selected digital channels were examined. Starting

 with the basic tier, we examined each channel for picture quality.

 A second set of tests were performed at one of the test points that

 Millennium uses to conduct the FCC tests. This test point used was

 located at 706 26th Avenue South in Seattle.

 A Stealth signal level meter model SDA4040D supplied by CTC, and a

 television receiver and spectrum analyzer provided by Millennium was

 used to conduct tests of the signal level, carrier-to-noise, hum, and

 subjective picture viewing tests at the sites. The detailed test

 results are provided in Appendix A.

 Overall, the visual testing and quantitative measurements support

 that the system was operating properly at all test points.

 Measurements were made with regular programming to minimize

 subscriber inconvenience. All measured parameters were well within

 the FCC's specification with the exception of the carrier-to-noise

 measurement on channel 29, the Public Access Channel.

 IV. PHYSICAL PLANT INSPECTION

 A physical inspection of the cable plant, which included both

 underground and aerial construction, was conducted in the area around

 the proof test sites. The inspection concentrated on an examination

 of the quality of the plant construction, appearance, and compliance

 with national construction standards.

 4.1 Physical Plant Standards

 There are two primary national construction standards cited with

 which the cable system must comply.

 The first standard, the National Electrical Safety Code ("NESC")

 published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,

 Inc., 2002, is the primary guide to construction of the cable system

 in the public rights-of-way. The NESC is a national code designed to

 provide standards and work rules to protect persons against hazards

 from the installation, maintenance, and operation of electrical

 systems and communications lines.

 The second standard is the National Electrical Code ("NEC") published

 by the National Fire Protection Association, Inc., 2002. This

 national code establishes rules for the safe installation of

 electrical conductors and equipment.

 During our inspection of the cable plant in the areas around the test

 points and the drop inspection, we did not find any infractions on

 the utility poles relating to these codes. The following sections

 address the categories for violations of physical plant construction

 that we look for in the public rights-of way.

 4.1.1 Bonding and Grounding

 We inspect bonding and grounding according to NEC and NESC and

 industry standards for the safety of workers on the aerial and

 underground cables and at subscriber homes and equipment. Grounding

 protects against injury from lightning and surges of excessive

 electrical current on the system.

 Grounding is required for electrified system components at specified

 locations along the plant itself. This is accomplished by bonding

 the cable plant and equipment to the common neutral ground of the

 other utilities on the poles. Alternatively, when there is no other

 ground, the cable system is directly grounded with a ground rod at

 the site where grounding is required. Bonding creates "the

 permanent joining of metallic parts to form an electrically

 conductive path that ensures electrical continuity and the capacity

 to conduct safely any current likely to be imposed" (NEC ART. 100).

 The authorities for reporting these kinds of violations may be found

 in the following:

 * NEC, Rules 820-33, 820-40; and

 * NESC, section092C, section093D, section215, and section239.

 No grounding or bonding violations were found on utility poles during

 our inspection.

 4.1.2 Lashing

 In aerial portions of the cable system, the cables are attached to

 steel cables or "strand" that is bolted to the poles. A strong thin

 lashing wire is wrapped around both the cable and strand to secure

 the cable to its supporting strand. This practice places the weight

 of the cable on the strand rather than on the cable itself.

 Improper lashing can result in undue stress on the cable and

 connectors, potentially causing signal quality problems. If the

 lashing wire breaks and unravels, it usually causes the cable to fall

 from its supporting strand toward the ground, thereby reducing

 clearances over streets, driveways, or sidewalks and presenting

 hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

 No loose or broken lashing wires were observed during the inspection.

 4.1.3 Construction

 The construction category addresses the manner in which the cable

 system is built. Poor construction practices are evident in such

 violations as bolts of improper length, which if too long create

 hazards for personnel climbing the poles, or if too short fail to

 secure the cables to the poles (NESC section217A4). Other violations

 in this category include missing bolts, strand that is not attached

 to poles, strand that does not have the proper tension, cable

 supports and spacers that are missing or improperly installed, and

 equipment that is improper for the system.

 No construction violations were observed in the inspected areas.

 4.1.4 Clearances

 Clearances of the cables from the ground, streets and sidewalks, and

 other utilities are specified in national codes such as the NESC

 section23 and Tables 232 and 234. All cables on the utility poles

 and underground should be placed in a manner to avoid contact with

 one another. The codes establish acceptable distances between power,

 telephone, and other communications lines placed on the same poles

 and in the same area in the public rights-of-way or public utility

 easements.

 Proper distance between cable television lines and other utility

 cables provides a level of safety for all workers on the poles. The

 clearance distances from power lines and streets and sidewalks are

 established to permit safe and unhindered access to cables on the

 poles and to avoid obstructions to vehicular traffic and pedestrians

 passing under the cables.

 No violations were observed in the inspected areas.

 4.1.5 Guying and anchoring

 In aerial construction, guy wires are necessary to provide additional

 support to the utility pole where the weight of cables on the poles

 is greater than can be safely supported by the poles alone. Guy

 wires are required not only for poles that support a large number of

 cables, but also for poles supporting very long spans of cable, and

 on corners or at the end-of-lines where there is also additional

 weight on the poles.

 Missing or improperly installed guy wires can create a public safety

 hazard because of a greater potential for pole failure under stress

 from high winds, accidents, or pole degradation over time.

 The steel cables used to guy the poles must be properly bolted to the

 poles and anchored in the ground at prescribed tensions. At ground

 level, the guy wire itself is required to be covered with a plastic

 "guard" to alert passersby to the presence of the wire and protect

 pedestrians from accidental injury.

 The requirements for guy wire violations are documented in NESC Rules

 261B, 261C, 261D, and 264.

 No violations in this category were observed in the inspected areas.

 4.2 Subscriber Drop-Related Violations

 "Drops" are the wires that connect the subscriber homes to the cable

 system on the street. Under the NEC, drops are required to meet

 specific construction standards for attachment to the homes. These

 standards have requirements for attachment to the residence,

 clearance from the ground or depth of buried cable, and grounding to

 protect against shock, equipment damage, and fire hazards. Drop

 violations include drops from aerial plant down a utility pole to an

 underground service connection not being secured to the pole and

 which may become inadvertently snagged and disconnected.

 Safety is a significant concern in installation and maintenance of

 drops. For example, a common operator practice is to place a

 temporary unburied drop to a home serviced by underground plant.

 This can also occur when the ground is frozen or snow covered and

 cable cannot be buried at the time of installation. This may be

 acceptable for a few days, if properly guarded or marked, but when

 left exposed for weeks it is not only an annoyance to subscribers but

 presents a safety hazard in the public rights-of-way. These

 situations are also reported as violations. Standards for drop

 installation and maintenance are governed by generally accepted

 industry practices and by the NEC section250 and section820.

 4.2.1 Drop Grounding

 With regard to subscriber drop cables that connect subscriber

 residences to the cable system, we found a significant number of

 cable drops that were not compliant with the current electrical code.

 Table 1 provides a tabulation of the findings of our inspection at 16

 locations.

 limited sample area were fully compliant with the current provisions

 in the electrical codes. Figure 4 is a photograph of one of the

 fully compliant installations observed.

 CHAPTER I--FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

 COMMISSION (CONTINUED)

 PART 76_MULTICHANNEL VIDEO AND CABLE TELEVISION SERVICE

 Subpart K Technical Standards

 Sec. 76.601 Performance tests.

 (a) The operator of each cable television system shall be responsible

 for insuring that each such system is designed, installed, and

 operated in a manner that fully complies with the provisions of this

 subpart.

 (b) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct

 complete performance tests of that otherwise noted below. The

 performance tests shall be directed at determining the extent to

 which the system complies with all the technical standards set forth

 in Sec. 76.605(a) and shall be as follows:

 (1) For cable television systems with 1000 or more subscribers but

 with 12,500 or fewer subscribers, proof-of-performance tests

 conducted pursuant to this section shall include measurements taken

 at six (6) widely separated points. However, within each cable

 system, one additional test point shall be added for every additional

 12,500 subscribers or fraction thereof (e.g., 7 test points if 12,501

 to 25,000 subscribers; 8 test points if 25,001 to 37,500 subscribers,

 etc.). In addition, for technically integrated portions of cable

 systems that are not mechanically continuous (i.e., employing

 microwave connections), at least one test point will be required for

 each portion of the cable system served by a technically integrated

 microwave hub. The proof-of-performance test points chosen shall be

 balanced to represent all geographic areas served by the cable

 system. At least one-third of the test points shall be representative

 of subscriber terminals most distant from the system input and from

 each microwave receiver (if microwave transmissions are employed), in

 terms of cable length. The measurements may be taken at convenient

 monitoring points in the cable network: Provided, that data shall be

 included to relate the measured performance of the system as would be

 viewed from a nearby subscriber terminal. An identification of the

 instruments, including the makes, model numbers, and the most recent

 date of calibration, a description of the procedures utilized, and a

 statement of the qualifications of the person performing the tests

 shall also be included.

 (2) Proof-of-performance tests to determine the extent to which a

 cable television system complies with the standards set forth in Sec.

 76.605(a) (3), (4), and (5) shall be made on each of the NTSC or

 similar video channels of that system. Unless otherwise as noted,

 proof-of-performance tests for all other standards in Sec. 76.605(a)

 shall be made on a minimum of four (4) channels plus one additional

 channel for every 100 MHz, or fraction thereof, of cable distribution

 system upper frequency limit (e.g., 5 channels for cable television

 systems with a cable distribution system upper frequency limit of 101

 to 216 MHz; 6 channels for cable television systems with a cable

 distribution system upper frequency limit of 217-300 MHz; 7 channels

 for cable television systems with a cable distribution upper

 frequency limit to 300 to 400 MHz, etc.). The channels selected for

 testing must be representative of all the channels within the cable

 television system.

 (3) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct semi-

 annual proof-of-performance tests of that system, to determine the

 extent to which the system complies with the technical standards set

 forth in Sec. 76.605(a)(4) as follows. The visual signal level on

 each channel shall be measured and recorded, along with the date and

 time of the measurement, once every six hours (at intervals of not

 less than five hours or no more than seven hours after the previous

 measurement), to include the warmest and the coldest times, during a

 24-hour period in January or February and in July or August.

 (4) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct

 triennial proof-of-performance tests of its system to determine the

 extent to which the system complies with the technical standards set

 forth in Sec. 76.605(a)(11).

 (c) Successful completion of the performance tests required by

 paragraph (b) of this section does not relieve the system of the

 obligation to comply with all pertinent technical standards at all

 subscriber terminals. Additional tests, repeat tests, or tests

 involving specified subscriber terminals may be required by the

 Commission or the local franchiser to secure compliance with the

 technical standards.

 (d) The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall

 not apply to any cable television system having fewer than 1,000

 subscribers: Provided, however, that any cable television system

 using any frequency spectrum other than that allocated to over-the-

 air television and FM broadcasting (as described in Sec. Sec. 73.603

 and 73.210 of this chapter) is required to conduct all tests,

 measurements and monitoring of signal leakage that are required by

 this subpart. A cable television system operator complying with the

 monitoring, logging and the leakage repair requirements of Sec.

 76.614, shall be considered to have met the requirements of this

 paragraph. However, the leakage log shall be retained for five years

 rather than the two years prescribed in Sec. 76.1706.

 Note 1 to Sec. 76.601: Prior to requiring any additional testing

 pursuant to Sec. 76.601(c), the local franchising authority shall

 notify the cable operator who will be allowed thirty days to come

 into compliance with any perceived signal quality problems which need

 to be corrected. The Commission may request cable operators to test

 their systems at any time.

 Note 2 to Sec. 76.601: Section 76.1717 contains recordkeeping

 requirements for each system operator in order to show compliance

 with the technical rules of this subpart.

 Note 3 to Sec. 76.601: Section 76.1704 contains recordkeeping

 requirements for proof of performance tests.

 Sec. 76.605 Technical standards.

 (a) The following requirements apply to the performance of a cable

 television system as measured at any subscriber terminal with a

 matched impedance at the termination point or at the output of the

 modulating or processing equipment (generally the headend) of the

 cable television system or otherwise as noted. The requirements are

 applicable to each NTSC or similar video downstream cable television

 channel in the system:

 (1) (i) The cable television channels delivered to the subscriber's

 terminal shall be capable of being received and displayed by TV

 broadcast receivers used for off-the-air reception of TV broadcast

 signals, as authorized under part 73 of this chapter; and

 (ii) Cable television systems shall transmit signals to subscriber

 premises equipment on frequencies in accordance with the channel

 allocation plan set forth in CEA-542-B: ``Standard: Cable Television

 Channel Identification Plan,'' (Incorporated by reference, see Sec.

 76.602).

 (2) The aural center frequency of the aural carrier must be 4.5 MHz -

 5 kHz above the frequency of the visual carrier at the output of the

 modulating or processing equipment of a cable television system, and

 at the subscriber terminal.

 (3) The visual signal level, across a terminating impedance which

 correctly matches the internal impedance of the cable system as

 viewed from the subscriber terminal, shall not be less than 1

 millivolt across an internal impedance of 75 ohms (0 dBmV).

 Additionally, as measured at the end of a 30 meter (100 foot) cable

 drop that is connected to the subscriber tap, it shall not be less

 than 1.41 millivolts across an internal impedance of 75 ohms ( + 3

 dBmV). (At other impedance values, the minimum visual signal level,

 as viewed from the subscriber terminal, shall be the square root of

 0.0133 (Z) millivolts and, as measured at the end of a 30 meter (100

 foot) cable drop that is connected to the subscriber tap, shall be 2

 times the square root of 0.00662(Z) millivolts, where Z is the

 appropriate impedance value.)

 (4) The visual signal level on each channel, as measured at the end

 of a 30 meter cable drop that is connected to the subscriber tap,

 shall not vary more than 8 decibels within any six-month interval,

 which must include four tests performed in six-hour increments during

 a 24-hour period in July or August and during a 24-hour period in

 January or February, and shall be maintained within:

 (i) 3 decibels (dB) of the visual signal level of any visual carrier

 within a 6 MHz nominal frequency separation;

 (ii) 10 dB of the visual signal level on any other channel on a cable

 television system of up to 300 MHz of cable distribution system upper

 frequency limit, with a 1 dB increase for each additional 100 MHz of

 cable distribution system upper frequency limit (e.g., 11 dB for a

 system at 301-400 MHz; 12 dB for a system at 401-500 MHz, etc.); and

 (iii) A maximum level such that signal degradation due to overload in

 the subscriber's receiver or terminal does not occur.

 (5) The rms voltage of the aural signal shall be maintained between

 10 and 17 decibels below the associated visual signal level. This

 requirement must be met both at the subscriber terminal and at the

 output of the modulating and processing equipment (generally the

 headend). For subscriber terminals that use equipment which modulate

 and remodulate the signal the rms voltage of the aural signal shall

 be maintained between 6.5 and 17 decibels below the associated visual

 signal level at the subscriber terminal.

 (6) The amplitude characteristic shall be within a range of 2

 decibels from 0.75 MHz to 5.0 MHz above the lower boundary frequency

 of the cable television channel, referenced to the average of the

 highest and lowest amplitudes within these frequency boundaries. The

 amplitude characteristic shall be measured at the subscriber

 terminal.

 (7) The ratio of RF visual signal level to system noise shall not be

 less than 43 decibels. For class I cable television channels, the

 requirements of this section are applicable only to:

 (i) Each signal which is delivered by a cable television system to

 subscribers within the predicted Grade B contour for that signal;

 (ii) Each signal which is first picked up within its predicted Grade

 B contour;

 (iii) Each signal that is first received by the cable television

 system by direct video feed from a TV broadcast station, a low power

 TV station, or a TV translator station.

 (8) The ratio of visual signal level to the rms amplitude of any

 coherent disturbances such as intermodulation products, second and

 third order distortions or discrete-frequency interfering signals not

 operating on proper offset assignments shall be as follows:

 (i) The ratio of visual signal level to coherent disturbances shall

 not be less than 51 decibels for noncoherent channel cable television

 systems, when measured with modulated carriers and time averaged; and

 (ii) The ratio of visual signal level to coherent disturbances which

 are frequency-coincident with the visual carrier shall not be less

 than 47 decibels for coherent channel cable systems, when measured

 with modulated carriers and time averaged.

 (9) The terminal isolation provided to each subscriber terminal:

 (i) Shall not be less than 18 decibels. In lieu of periodic testing,

 the cable operator may use specifications provided by the

 manufacturer for the terminal isolation equipment to meet this

 standard; and

 (ii) Shall be sufficient to prevent reflections caused by open-

 circuited or short-circuited subscriber terminals from producing

 visible picture impairments at any other subscriber terminal.

 (10) The peak-to-peak variation in visual signal level caused by

 undesired low frequency disturbances (hum or repetitive transients)

 generated within the system, or by inadequate low frequency response,

 shall not exceed 3 percent of the visual signal level. Measurements

 made on a single channel using a single unmodulated carrier may be

 used to demonstrate compliance with this parameter at each test

 location.

 (11) As of June 30, 1995, the following requirements apply to the

 performance of the cable television system as measured at the output

 of the modulating or processing equipment (generally the headend) of

 the system:

 (i) The chrominance-luminance delay inequality (or chroma delay),

 which is the change in delay time of the chrominance component of the

 signal relative to the luminance component, shall be within 170

 nanoseconds.

 (ii) The differential gain for the color subcarrier of the television

 signal, which is measured as the difference in amplitude between the

 largest and smallest segments of the chrominance signal (divided by

 the largest and expressed in percent), shall not exceed 20%.

 (iii) The differential phase for the color subcarrier of the

 television signal which is measured as the largest phase difference

 in degrees between each segment of the chrominance signal and

 reference segment (the segment at the blanking level of O IRE), shall

 not exceed 10 degrees.

 (12) As an exception to the general provision requiring measurements

 to be made at subscriber terminals, and without regard to the type of

 signals carried by the cable television system, signal leakage from a

 cable television system shall be measured in accordance with the

 procedures outlined in Sec. 76.609(h) and shall be limited as

 follows:

 Signal leakage

 (b) Cable television systems distributing signals by using methods

 such as non-conventional coaxial cable techniques, non-coaxial copper

 cable techniques, specialized coaxial cable and fiber optical cable

 hybridization techniques or specialized compression techniques or

 specialized receiving devices, and which, because of their basic

 design, cannot comply with one or more of the technical standards set

 forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may be permitted to operate:

 Provided, That an adequate showing is made pursuant to Sec. 76.7

 which establishes that the public interest is benefited. In such

 instances, the Commission may prescribe special technical

 requirements to ensure that subscribers to such systems are provided

 with an equivalent level of good quality service.

 Note 1: Local franchising authorities of systems serving fewer than

 1000 subscribers may adopt standards less stringent than those in

 Sec. 76.605(a). Any such agreement shall be reduced to writing and be

 associated with the system's proof-of-performance records.

 Note 2: For systems serving rural areas as defined in Sec. 76.5, the

 system may negotiate with its local franchising authority for

 standards less stringent than those in Sec. Sec. 76.605(a)(3),

 76.605(a)(7), 76.605(a)(8), 76.605(a)(10) and 76.605(a)(11). Any such

 agreement shall be reduced to writing and be associated with the

 system's proof-of-performance records.

 Note 3: The requirements of this section shall not apply to devices

 subject to the TV interface device rules under part 15 of this

 chapter.

 Note 4: Should subscriber complaints arise from a system failing to

 meet Sec. 76.605(a)(6) prior to December 30, 1999, the cable operator

 will be required to provide a converter that will allow the system to

 meet the standard immediately at the complaining subscriber's

 terminal. Further, should the problem be found to be system-wide, the

 Commission may order all converters on the system be changed to meet

 the standard.

 Note 5: Should subscriber complaints arise from a system failing to

 meet Sec. 76.605(a)(10), the cable operator will be required to

 remedy the complaint and perform test measurements on Sec.

 76.605(a)(10) containing the full number of channels as indicated in

 Sec. 76.601(b)(2) at the complaining subscriber's terminal. Further,

 should the problem be found to be system-wide, the Commission may

 order that the full number of channels as indicated in Sec.

 76.601(b)(2) be tested at all required locations for future proof-of-

 performance tests.

 Note 6: No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or

 restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber equipment or

 any transmission technology.

 Sec. 76.609 Measurements.

 (a) Measurements made to demonstrate conformity with the performance

 requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 76.601 and 76.605 shall be made

 under conditions which reflect system performance during normal

 operations, including the effect of any microwave relay operated in

 the Cable Television Relay (CARS) Service intervening between pickup

 antenna and the cable distribution network. Amplifiers shall be

 operated at normal gains, either by the insertion of appropriate

 signals or by manual adjustment. Special signals inserted in a cable

 television channel for measurement purposes should be operated at

 levels approximating those used for normal operation. Pilot tones,

 auxiliary or substitute signals, and non-television signals normally

 carried on the cable television system should be operated at normal

 levels to the extent possible. Some exemplary, but not mandatory,

 measurement procedures are set forth in this section.

 (b) When it may be necessary to remove the television signal normally

 carried on a cable television channel in order to facilitate a

 performance measurement, it will be permissible to disconnect the

 antenna which serves the channel under measurement and to substitute

 there for a matching resistance termination. Other antennas and

 inputs should remain connected and normal signal levels should be

 maintained on other channels.

 (c) As may be necessary to ensure satisfactory service to a

 subscriber, the Commission may require additional tests to

 demonstrate system performance or may specify the use of different

 test procedures.

 (d) The frequency response of a cable television channel may be

 determined by one of the following methods, as appropriate:

 (1) By using a swept frequency or a manually variable signal

 generator at the sending end and a calibrated attenuator and

 frequency-selective voltmeter at the subscriber terminal; or

 (2) By using either a multi-burst generator or vertical interval test

 signals and either a modulator or processor at the sending end, and

 by using either a demodulator and either an oscilloscope display or a

 waveform monitor display at the subscriber terminal.

 (e) System noise may be measured using a frequency-selective

 voltmeter (field strength meter) which has been suitably calibrated

 to indicate RMS noise or average power level and which has a known

 bandwidth. With the system operating at normal level and with a

 properly matched resistive termination substituted for the antenna,

 noise power indications at the subscriber terminal are taken in

 successive increments of frequency equal to the bandwidth of the

 frequency-selective voltmeter, summing the power indications to

 obtain the total noise power present over a 4 MHz band centered

 within the cable television channel. If it is established that the

 noise level is constant within this bandwidth, a single measurement

 may be taken which is corrected by an appropriate factor representing

 the ratio of 4 MHz to the noise bandwidth of the frequency-selective

 voltmeter. If an amplifier is inserted between the frequency-

 selective voltmeter and the subscriber terminal in order to

 facilitate this measurement, it should have a bandwidth of at least 4

 MHz and appropriate corrections must be made to account for its gain

 and noise figure. Alternatively, measurements made in accordance with

 the NCTA Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television

 Systems, 2nd edition, November 1989, on noise measurement may be

 employed.

 (f) The amplitude of discrete frequency interfering signals within a

 cable television channel may be determined with either a spectrum

 analyzer or with a frequency-selective voltmeter (field strength

 meter), which instruments have been calibrated for adequate accuracy.

 If calibration accuracy is in doubt, measurements may be referenced

 to a calibrated signal generator, or a calibrated variable

 attenuator, substituted at the point of measurement. If an amplifier

 is used between the subscriber terminal and the measuring instrument,

 appropriate corrections must be made to account for its gain.

 (g) The terminal isolation between any two terminals in the cable

 television system may be measured by applying a signal of known

 amplitude to one terminal and measuring the amplitude of that signal

 at the other terminal. The frequency of the signal should be close to

 the mid-frequency of the channel being tested. Measurements of

 terminal isolation are not required when either:

 (1) The manufacturer's specifications for subscriber tap isolation

 based on a representative sample of no less than 500 subscribers taps

 or

 (2) Laboratory tests performed by or for the operator of a cable

 television system on a representative sample of no less than 50

 subscriber taps, indicates that the terminal isolation standard of

 Sec. 76.605(a)(9) is met. To demonstrate compliance with Sec.

 76.605(a)(9), the operator of a cable television system shall attach

 either such manufacturer's specifications or laboratory measurements

 as an exhibit to each proof-of-performance record.

 (h) Measurements to determine the field strength of the signal

 leakage emanated by the cable television system shall be made in

 accordance with standard engineering procedures. Measurements made on

 frequencies above 25 MHz shall include the following:

 (1) A field strength meter of adequate accuracy using a horizontal

 dipole antenna shall be employed.

 (2) Field strength shall be expressed in terms of the RMS value of

 synchronizing peak for each cable television channel for which signal

 leakage can be measured.

 (3) The resonant half wave dipole antenna shall be placed 3 meters

 from and positioned directly below the system components and at 3

 meters above ground. Where such placement results in a separation of

 less than 3 meters between the center of the dipole antenna and the

 system components, or less than 3 meters between the dipole and

 ground level, the dipole shall be repositioned to provide a

 separation of 3 meters from the system components at a height of 3

 meters or more above ground.

 (4) The horizontal dipole antenna shall be rotated about a vertical

 axis and the maximum meter reading shall be used.

 (5) Measurements shall be made where other conductors are 3 or more

 meters (10 or more feet) away from the measuring antenna.

 (i) For systems using cable traps and filters to control the delivery

 of specific channels to the subscriber terminal, measurements made to

 determine compliance with Sec. 76.605(a) (5) and (6) may be performed

 at the location immediately prior to the trap or filter for the

 specific channel. The effects of these traps or filters, as certified

 by the system engineer or the equipment manufacturer, must be

 attached to each proof-of-performance record.

 (j) Measurements made to determine the differential gain,

 differential phase and the chrominance-luminance delay inequality

 (chroma delay) shall be made in accordance with the NCTA Recommended

 Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems, 2nd edition,

 November 1989, on these parameters.
