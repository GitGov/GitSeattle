 WHEREAS, the City Council may grant permission to construct, maintain and operate structures such as skybridges and tunnels over, under and across public rights-of-way through the issuance of a long-term permit of 10 to 30 years duration by ordinance, herein referred to as a "term permit"; and

 WHEREAS, certain older ordinances granting such term permits require that administrative changes to the permit terms such as modifications to the fee, insurance and bond amounts, automatic permit renewal, and transfer of the permit to successor entities require City Council action in the form of a resolution; and

 WHEREAS, there are now more than 60 term permits requiring City Council action for administrative changes every five years at a minimum, resulting in an undue burden of minor legislation to effect administrative changes, thereby slowing the legislative process; and

 WHEREAS, City Council and Mayor agree that the renewal of right-of-way permission, re-evaluation of the annual fee amount and modifications to certain administrative permit terms and conditions consistent with the City Council's initial approval and subsequent amendments of the permit should be handled as an internal administrative matter within the Seattle Department of Transportation; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
