 WHEREAS, in order to guide future development, the South Lake Union Design Guidelines were developed as part of the City's neighborhood planning process. These Guidelines apply to new multifamily and commercial development within the neighborhood boundaries as a way of promoting specific design goals identified by the neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, Design Review Board members, staff from the Department of Planning and Development and neighborhood representatives have prepared revisions to the guidelines that the City Council adopted by Ordinance 121305 on October 6, 2003; NOW, THEREFORE,
