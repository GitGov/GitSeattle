 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Mercer Corridor; modifying restrictions in the 2004 Adopted Budget that limit the Seattle Department of Transportation's spending on the Mercer Corridor Project; directing the Department of Transportation to develop a variant of the proposed Two-way Mercer Corridor improvements that meets certain performance standards; approving alternatives to be included in a Mercer Corridor Project Environmental Impact Statement; and directing the Department to evaluate other measures that may help traffic flow, including an aggressive Transportation Demand Management Program for South Lake Union.

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed a budget proviso relating to the Mercer Corridor Transportation Capital Improvement Project (TCIP) limiting project spending from 2004 appropriations to $163,000; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is conducting an Environmental Assessment (EA) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and adoption as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) for transportation improvements in the Mercer Corridor between I-5 and Aurora Avenue North; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has expressed strong interest in changing the character of Mercer from a freeway on-ramp to a two-way boulevard between I-5 and Fifth Avenue North at the Seattle Center and narrowing Valley Street to create a more pleasant approach to the South Lake Union (SLU) Park; and

 WHEREAS, for decades people have been searching for solutions to Mercer Street problems resulting from the tangle of roads weaving through the South Lake Union neighborhood that provide access from I-5 to the Seattle Center and to the surrounding urban neighborhoods of Uptown/Queen Anne, Denny Triangle and Fremont; and

 WHEREAS, in the late 1960's the City acquired a number of properties between I-5 and SR-99 with the intention of constructing a "Bay Freeway" which was ultimately challenged in court and rejected by the voters; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 30080 in 1999 setting forth public objectives for the sale of "Bay Freeway" properties including creating an attractive gateway, promoting a safe and active pedestrian environment, enhancing visual relationships in the park vicinity, and encouraging alternative forms of transportation; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 30610 in 2003 setting forth priorities to support redevelopment of the South Lake Union area including making transportation improvements to reconnect the South Lake Union street grid and promote connections with downtown and the Seattle Center, and promoting pedestrian-oriented improvements; and

 WHEREAS, the Mercer Corridor project is trying to meet a variety of objectives confirmed by project stakeholders including improved mobility through and within the South Lake Union area using a multi- modal approach, improved access and circulation within the neighborhood for all modes, improved regional access, provision of better connections between SLU and Queen Anne, improved safety for cars, bicycles and pedestrians throughout the corridor, enhanced environment around SLU Park and provision of better pedestrian connections between the neighborhood and the park/waterfront, support for economic development goals for SLU, and compatibility with the City's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, Council staff and staff from the Seattle Department of Transportation have worked together to agree on standards and measures for development of alternatives to be considered in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); and

 WHEREAS, the Council hereby approves a set of alternatives to be considered in an EIS; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Prior to the Council's selecting a Preferred Alternative, the Executive shall attempt, as part of the Mercer Corridor Project Environmental Impact Statement effort, to develop and analyze a set of Two-way Mercer Corridor improvements that meets the performance standards set out in this section, below. The Executive's analysis should demonstrate that these standards are expected to be met using the Executive's current estimates for full job and housing growth contemplated for South Lake Union in place. The performance standards are:

 a) For Alternative modes - Recommended Two-way Mercer improvements should deliver clear and demonstrable benefits for pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users that lead to a significant increase in the use of these modes. In particular,

 * In 2030, peak hour transit travel times should be significantly shorter than those for non-transit vehicles traveling the same route in order to provide a strong incentive for transit use. In attempting to accomplish this, the Executive shall explore dedicated transit lanes and transit priority signalization, among other techniques.

 * In 2030, to promote a safe, inviting pedestrian and bicycle environment, peak hour levels of service at each signalized intersection shall be grade D or better along any bicycle paths and at all major pedestrian crossings, including crossings of Valley Street to the South Lake Union Park.

 b) For Vehicular mobility - Recommended Two-way Mercer improvements should both limit degradation of vehicular mobility in South Lake Union over current conditions and deliver clear benefits over no action. In particular,

 * In 2030, average per person peak hour travel times with recommended improvements should be at least 10% less than what would occur with no improvements. Transit travel times should contribute toward meeting this goal.

 * In 2030, peak period average congestion delays in South Lake Union should not increase more than 50% from 2004 levels. In achieving the 50% target, faster transit travel should be considered, with transit travel times weighted by the projected number of passengers.

 c) On-street parking - If the standards above cannot be achieved by roadway and signal improvements alone, the Executive should revisit their goal of preserving on-street parking in SLU. Such parking both encourages auto travel and takes up public roadway space that is needed for vehicular mobility. A lane of parked cars could be dedicated transit lane instead.

 Section 2. The Seattle Department of Transportation shall study and evaluate other measures that may help traffic flow and circulation in the South Lake Union area and ease congestion throughout the Mercer Corridor. At a minimum this analysis shall include:

 A. Management of the traffic flow from I-5, including the weave of traffic originating from SR-520, improving the off-ramps at Stewart and Denny, widening Denny Way,

 and restricting single occupancy vehicles from using the Mercer on- ramp to the I-5 express lanes. In addition, the study and evaluation of alternative combinations, such as implementation of reversible lanes in conjunction with SR-520 improvements, likely to improve traffic and reduce congestion; and

 B. Development of an aggressive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program for South Lake Union to reduce dependency on private automobiles while enhancing access and mobility for people. The TDM program should consider: expanding trip choices by making a variety of bicycle improvements (lanes, way finding, paths, amenities at trip destinations), encouraging ridesharing and providing priority access for high-occupancy vehicles (HOV) to and from I-5 as well as preferred parking access on neighborhood streets; encouraging shifts to transit and HOV by implementing parking pricing, parking cash-out programs, providing priority treatment for transit within the Mercer Corridor and managing Seattle Center special event traffic in favor of transit or HOVs; managing parking by promoting shared parking or parking brokerage programs; and working with neighborhood and business organizations to support TDM strategies especially useful in South Lake Union. SDOT's analysis should estimate the changed SLU modal split resulting from the TDM and the mobility benefits deriving from it.

 SDOT shall make these mandated studies and analysis a priority for completion and present findings to the Council before making significant, additional expenditures on the Environmental Impact Statement process. Prior to final determination of the Mercer Corridor Project EIS Preferred Alternative, the Council shall receive and consider all analysis requested in this Section. SDOT shall provide quarterly progress reports, regarding the Mercer Corridor analysis described in this Section to the Transportation Committee of the Council. In addition, the Executive team lead for this project shall confer as appropriate with the Chair of the Transportation Committee and with other Councilmembers and Council Central Staff, regarding significant strategic, policy or budgetary issues.

 Section 3. The following 2004 budget proviso is modified as shown.

 Section 4. Any EIS for Mercer Corridor improvements should contain analysis of how such improvements will facilitate movement of traffic during reconstruction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct. In particular, the impact analysis should show how additional traffic demands during Alaska Way Viaduct reconstruction affect congestion in South Lake Union and what is proposed to mitigate any congestion.

 Section 5: Any EIS for Mercer Corridor improvements should contain analysis of how such improvements will facilitate movement of freight efficiently and reliably.

 Section 6: The Council approves the following alternatives (in addition to the No Action alternative) to be included in an EIS:

 * Executive's recommended Two-way Mercer/Narrow Valley alternative, which broadens and converts to a two-way thoroughfare Mercer Avenue between the I-5 ramps and the intersection of Broad Street and Ninth Avenue; and

 * A variant of the Executive's recommended Two-way Mercer/Narrow Valley alternative that meets stated performance standards in Section 1 or comes significantly closer to meeting them than the Executive's recommended Two-way Mercer/Narrow Valley alternative; and

 * Fairview-Valley Intersection Realignment and Roy Street grade separated crossing of Aurora Ave alternative; and

 * The Area wide Improvements alternative in the Executive's South Lake Union Transportation Study.
