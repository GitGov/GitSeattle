 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to regular property taxes; providing for the submission to the qualified voters of the City at an election called on November 8, 2005, of a proposition authorizing the City to levy property taxes for up to three years in excess of the 101% limitation and any other limitation on levies in Chapter 84.55 RCW for the purpose of providing City services, including police and human services.

 WHEREAS due to fiscal constraints the City abrogated 26 police officer positions in 2003; and

 WHEREAS although the cost of City services rises at the rate of inflation, the voters of the State of Washington approved Initiative 747 at the general election held on November 6, 2001, for the most part limiting the revenue from regular property taxes to an increase of one percent per year absent voter approval of a greater increase; and

 WHEREAS the difference between the City property tax revenue allowed by Initiative 747 and the City property tax revenue that would have been allowed in an emergency had Initiative 747 not been approved by the voters increases by approximately nine million dollars each year; and

 WHEREAS the City Council does not intend to supplant existing sources of funding for police and human services; and

 WHEREAS some public safety problems are intractable unless underlying human conditions are addressed;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council makes the following findings:

 a. Providing City services, including public safety and human services, is a City purpose.

 b. An urgent need exists to continue the provision of City services, including public safety and human services to be funded with Proceeds of regular property taxes, and its urgency requires submission to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle of a proposition authorizing regular property tax levies in excess of the levy limitations in Chapter 84.55 RCW, as it now exists or may thereafter be amended, for up to three years at an election to be held in conjunction with the general City election on November 8, 2005.

 Section 2. Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following words shall have the following meanings:

 A. "Proceeds" means that portion of regular property taxes levied and collection as authorized by voter approval pursuant to this ordinance that are above the 101% limit on levies in RCW 85.55.010, and all interest and other earnings thereon.

 B. "Levy Police Services" means Patrol Officers in bicycle patrols or on foot beats, Community Services Officers, Crime Prevention Coordinators, School Resource Officers and cadets, all of whose efforts are intended to reduce the impact of crime on the use and enjoyment of public places.

 C. "Levy Human Services" means street outreach services, drug treatment, case management services and hygiene and drop-in services that are intended to reduce homelessness, reduce chronic public inebriation and reduce the impact of crime on the use and enjoyment of public places.

 Section 3. Levy of Regular Property Taxes - Submittal. The City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the limitations on regular property taxes contained in Chapter 84.55 RCW, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, for property taxes levied in 2005 through 2007 for collection in 2006 through 2008, respectively. In addition to funding regular City services without reduction in the regular tax levy, this proposition would allow raising $9 million in 2006, $9.225 million in 2007 and $9.456 million in 2008 solely to provide Levy Police Services and Levy Human Services. To allow these additional amounts to be raised for these purposes, the "limit factor" under Chapter 84.55 RCW shall be 102.5% for regular property taxes payable in 2007 and 2008. The proposition shall be further limited so that the City shall not levy more than $9 million in 2005 for collection in 2006 nor more than $9.456 million in any year in addition to the maximum amount of regular property taxes it would have been limited to by the 101% limit in RCW 84.55.010 in the absence of voter approval under this ordinance, plus other authorized lid lifts. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(4), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2009 for collection in 2010 and in later years shall be computed as if the levy lid in RCW 84.55.010 had not been lifted under this ordinance.

 Section 4. Use of Funds.

 A. Of the Proceeds collected in each year pursuant to this ordinance, 50% shall be used to fund Levy Police Services and 50% shall be used to fund Levy Human Services. The City shall determine the use of Proceeds within these purposes by appropriations in the annual budget or other budget ordinances.

 B. The Proceeds shall be deposited in the City Treasury into a special 2005 Civil Streets Initiative Account (the "Account") within the General Subfund. Moneys in the Account may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money and interest and other earnings shall be deposited in the Account.

 Section 5. Non-supplant. If the additional regular property taxes authorized by this ordinance are approved by the voters, and unless the City Council by a three-fourths (3/4) vote determines that a natural or economic disaster requires otherwise, the City will appropriate annually through 2008, from sources other than the additional taxes authorized pursuant to this ordinance, at least $174,284,009 for police services and at least $24,013,352 for human services, the same dollar amounts that were appropriated from the General Subfund for these services in the adopted 2004 budget.

 Section 6. Oversight Committee. There shall be created an advisory committee called the Civil Streets Oversight Committee ("Oversight Committee"). The Oversight Committee shall review the expenditures of the Proceeds, advise upon expenditures for the following year, make recommendations on the implementation of particular programs, and evaluate the success of the programs. The Oversight Committee shall have eleven (11) members. The members shall include the Chief of Police, the Human Services Director and nine appointed members. The Mayor and Council shall each appoint four of the appointed members; these eight appointed members shall appoint the ninth appointed member. Upon the resignation, retirement, death, incapacity or removal of an appointed Oversight Committee member, the authority appointing such member may appoint a replacement for the balance of the term. All members not appointed by the City Council shall be subject to confirmation by the City Council. Members shall be appointed to serve for three (3) years. A member shall be subject to removal by his or her appointing authority for being absent without good cause from two (2) consecutive meetings, for moving his or her residence from Seattle, or for other cause. Members shall serve without pay but may be reimbursed for their expenses, including payments for childcare while attending meetings. The Oversight Committee may adopt rules for its own procedures, including quorum requirements and the frequency of meetings. The Oversight Committee shall make annual reports to the Mayor and City Council. The Executive shall provide staff and logistical support to the Oversight Committee. The Oversight Committee shall continue in existence through December 31, 2008, and thereafter if so provided by ordinance.

 Section 7. Election - Ballot Title. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested to conduct a special election, which the City hereby calls pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, to be held in conjunction with the general City election on November 8, 2005, and to submit to the qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth below.

 The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed not less than forty-five days prior to November 8, 2005 to certify the proposition to the King County Director of Records and Elections in the following form or as modified by the City Attorney pursuant to RCW 29A.36.071:
