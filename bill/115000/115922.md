 This project includes an interior build-out and equipment purchase to create a fitness room in the newly acquired 420 square foot store- front space located in the International District Village Square complex. The space directly adjoins the International District/Chinatown Community Center and will be incorporated as part of that facility. The space was originally built as a small, store- front, rental condominium and has been vacant since the building was completed. This project will expand current programming to include recreational and fitness opportunities that are currently not available at the community center.

 This project is an addition to the International District/Chinatown Community Center project (K73482), which constructed a 7,000 square foot community center and 8,000 square foot gym. The community center was funded through the 1999 Seattle Center and Community Centers Levy, the Neighborhood Matching Fund, CDBG funds, the Opportunity Fund category of the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy (2000 Parks Levy), and some private funding.

 In the first quarter 2007 supplemental budget legislation, $76,200 from the 1999 Community Center Levy Fund (33800) was appropriated. An additional $54,000 was transferred from savings in the original International District Community Center project, for a total allocation of $130,200 for the Fitness Room.

 *This detail is for information only. Funds are appropriated in the budget at the Budget Control Level. Amounts in thousands of dollars.

 This project provides funding to cover the costs of pre-acquisition activities (including planning, title searches, appraisals, negotiations, and community involvement) associated with negotiations for, and purchases of, specified real property under the 2000 Parks Levy. More than 20 specific parcels are targeted for purchase under the overall Neighborhood Park Acquisitions Program, as indicated in Ordinance 120024. Such properties are generally developed into new neighborhood and community parks as part of the Neighborhood Park Development category of the 2000 Parks Levy. Acquisitions identified in the Levy include: Alki Substation, Ballard Park, California Substation, Capitol Hill Park, Central Area Park (Homer Harris Park), Delridge Open Space, First Hill Park, Green Lake Open Space, Lake City Civic Core, Morgan Substation, North Open Space, Northgate Park and Ride, Queen Anne Park, Smith Cove, Whittier Substation, and York Substation. Alternate sites may be substituted.

 Up to $16 million is available under the 2000 Parks Levy for projects in the Neighborhood Park Acquisitions Program. When property is purchased, the ancillary costs associated with the specific property are transferred from this project to the property project, along with the actual purchase costs. Funding for most of these related projects is appropriated through individual ordinances rather than the budget process. In the 2005, the fourth quarter supplemental budget legislation, Ordinance 121993, added $50,000 in Washington State Interagency Committee grant funds to help pay for acquisition of Puget Creek Natural Area property; this funding was transferred out of the project when the property was purchased.

 In 2006, the second quarter supplemental budget legislation (Ordinance 122226) added $3 million for impending acquisition costs. In 2007, an additional $2 million was added in the first quarter supplemental. The funding will be transferred to specific projects as needed.

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, includes the inflation allowance for projects in the Neighborhood Park Development Program (Budget Control Level K723003). The project supplies inflation allowance for projects on a case-by-case basis, subject to Department recommendations. As a project begins the planning phase, the inflation allowance is calculated and transferred from this project to the actual project budget.

 In 2006, upon the recommendation of the Pro Parks Oversight Committee, approximately $500,000 was

 transferred from this project to several neighborhood park development projects to cover an additional inflation allowance. This allowance was provided to projects that had not yet begun construction to assure that higher-than-normal inflation in recent years would not reduce the original planned scope of these projects. In addition, the Committee recommended transferring $640,000 to three projects (California Substation, Colman Playfield, and Orchard Street Ravine) in order to complete or expand the scope of these projects.

An additional $5,000 from the 2000 Levy Fund (33850) was approved in the first quarter 2007 supplemental budget legislation to install instructional park bollards and signage at Interstate 5 Colonnade Parks. The funds were the result of a donation from the Seattle Park Foundation, which received it as a grant from Recreational Equipment Incorporated (REI).

An additional $48,000 from the 2000 Levy Fund (33850) was approved in the first quarter 2007 supplemental budget legislation to install a 140-foot ornamental wall and to relocate the bronze bell from the Volunteer Park Conservatory to the Rainforest Bell Center in the Kubota Garden. The funds were the result of a donation from the Kubota Garden Foundation.

 Neighborhood District: Northeast Urban Village: Not in an Urban Village

 This project, part of the 2000 Parks Levy, is the first phase of development of approximately 65 acres of wetlands and upland at Warren G. Magnuson Park. The project was combined with the ~~2001 project~~ Sand Point Magnuson Park -Wetlands Restoration project (K73503), which funded the design for the drainage in the park, demolition of two small buildings, and the removal of a portion of asphalt pavement near the athletic fields and wetland area.

 In 2000, the State of Washington Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development awarded a $500,000 grant to support this project. ~~, which reimburses the appropriation from the CRS-Unrestricted Subaccount included in Ordinance119959~~. In 2005, $800,000 was added ~~to this project in the second quarter 2005 supplemental budget legislation~~through Ordinance 121882) to demolish the foundations of the commissary complex of buildings at Magnuson Park and to provide minimal park amenities including walkways, park lawn, and habitat restoration. Also in 2005 ~~In addition, the 2005 fourth quarter supplemental budget legislation, Ordinance 121993, added~~$50,000 from King County was added to develop~~for a~~ community volunteer signage through Ordinance 121993.~~component of this project.~~

~~In 2006, the Department applied for two grants from the Washington State Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation (IAC). One grant for $500,000 would provide for construction of a pedestrian access trail from Sand Point Way to Sportsfield Drive. If the grant is awarded, the City's matching funds will come from this project as well as the Sand Point Magnuson Park - Athletic Field Development project (K733140). The second grant for $500,000 would extend the development of approximately 65 acres of wetlands and upland~~.

In 2007,~~The project includes an allocation of Cumulative Reserve Subfund - REET II Subaccount funding to~~$295,000 was added to remove the internal road and parking lot serving the central tennis courts, which bisect wetland habitat restoration areas. ~~In the 2007 budget process,~~ Council adopted the following proviso restricting the use of these funds:

 Of the appropriation for 2007 for the Department of Parks and Recreation's 2000 Parks Levy - Major Park Development BCL, $295,000 is appropriated solely for removing the internal road and parking lot serving the Magnuson Parks central tennis courts, and may be spent for no other purpose.

In 2007, the Department received $10,000 from the Sand Point Housing Association as a contribution toward the demolition of the bowling alley at Magnuson Park. The appropriation for the funds was included in the first quarter 2007 supplemental budget legislation .

 Operations and maintenance costs associated with 2000 Parks Levy projects will be funded out of levy proceeds through 2008. Additional operations and maintenance costs for funding provided by Council in the 2007 budget process have not yet been calculated and are not yet included in this project description.

This project constructs a new Fire Station 28 to accommodate modern equipment, apparatus and crew support functions that do not fit within the existing fire station. The new fire station will continue to house engine, ladder, and medic units, and will meet all modern construction codes, including "essential facility" seismic standards. Design and construction will proceed on the existing fire station site in a manner that allows continued operation of the existing station during construction of the new station. This project also includes the ~~This project renovates and expands the existing Fire Station 28 to accommodate additional equipment, apparatus, and crew support functions. The main level receives a full seismic retrofit and is reconfigured to accommodate a third apparatus bay. The other major change to Fire Station 28 is~~ construction of a new 5,400-square-foot building at the rear of the site to accommodate the Fire Department's Metropolitan Medical Response System, and Urban Search and Rescue units. ~~Following the upgrade, Fire Station 28 continues to house the engine, ladder, and medic units, and provides storage space for equipment associated with the Urban Search and Rescue and Metropolitan Medical Response System.~~Operating costs for the Fire Department and Fleets and Facilities Department are anticipated to increase due to the larger size of the fire station.

This project was originally planned as a major renovation and expansion of the existing Fire Station 28. During pre-design, it was found that a new station could be constructed for essentially the same cost as the renovation and expansion. Seismic retrofit work, particularly to the apparatus bay floor and vehicle openings, was a key factor in making these costs equivalent. The new station will continue to support the functions identified for Fire Station 28 in Fire Levy planning documents.

 In January 2006, ~~the Mayor proposed adding~~ $6.326 million was added to this project to reflect revisions to original levy estimates of project costs, to allow for higher-than-expected inflation and to pay for the additional cost of achieving a LEED Silver rating. Details of this proposal are contained in the Levy Financial Update. These additional funds are shown as appropriated from the Fire Facilities Fund until replaced by bond appropriations in 2008.

 This project provides for certain improvements to Seattle Police Department facilities including but not limited to~~at the~~ Airport Way Center (formerly Park 90/5), the East Precinct, the North Precinct, the Mounted Patrol, and the K-9 Facility. In 2007 a new appropriation funds a study of options for replacement of the North Precinct. The existing 16,000 square foot North Precinct building was built to accommodate 115 people and currently supports 200 police staff. A study conducted in 2002 concluded that a major renovation and expansion on the existing site was feasible at an approximate current cost of $31 million. The 2007 appropriation pays for a study to examine three alternatives for expanding the North Precinct: (i) renovate in a manner consistent with the 2002 study; (ii) build a new North Precinct at a new location; and, (iii) create a satellite precinct to house a portion of current North Precinct staff.

 Work funded in previous years includes replacement of the 50-ton HVAC air handlers at Park 90/5; roof repairs at the K-9 Facility; and replacement of an emergency generator at the East Precinct. The LTD budget shown below includes amounts previously appropriated to the BCL A51638.
