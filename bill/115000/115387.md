 4. The individual agrees to release the City of Seattle from any and all liability arising from loss of property, injury, illness or death while so deployed, except to the extent that his or her illness, injury or death may be covered under the workers' compensation, Law Enforcement Officers and Fire Fighters Plan and emergency worker laws of the State of Washington;
