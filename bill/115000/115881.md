 13.3 Neither the grant of the Easement, nor any provision of this Agreement or the Easement, is in conflict with any provision of any other agreement or instrument by which Grantor is bound or to which the Property is subject (including but not limited to any debts that are secured by the Property), nor shall the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement and the Easement constitute an event of default under any such agreement or instrument.

 14. TRANSFER, LEASE, RENTAL, OR PERMISSION FOR USE OF FACILITY

 If the Grantor transfers the Property, or leases, rents, or otherwise permits any person to use the Facilities Space in any manner whatsoever, Grantor shall remain bound by this Agreement and the Easement and shall not be released from any of Grantor's obligations hereunder.

 15. RECORDING AND PRIORITY

 The Easement shall be duly recorded with King County.

 16. NONDISCRIMINATION

 Grantor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply, with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and the City of Seattle, including but not limited to Chapters 14.04, 14.06, 14.10, 20.42, and 20.45 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), to the extent applicable, and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their officers.

 17. JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS

 The obligations of Grantor hereunder shall be the joint and several obligations of ACRS and LLC.

 18. DEFAULT BY GRANTOR AND REMEDIES

 18.1 If Grantor fails to perform when required any obligation hereunder or in the Easement, or otherwise breaches any term hereof or thereof, the City may provide written notice to Grantor, specifying the nature of the breach and the reasonable number of days (but in any event the City shall not be required to allow more than sixty (60) days) after the date of the notice within which such breach must be cured. Unless Grantor shall fully cure all breaches specified in such notice within the time allowed, Grantor shall be in Default.

 18.2 If any provision hereof or in the Easement specifies that an event or circumstance is a Default, then such event or circumstance shall be a Default without notice, or after the notice specified in that provision, as applicable.

 18.3 If there shall be an Event of Default, as defined in any documents relating to the CDBG Loan, then Grantor shall be in Default hereunder, without notice or opportunity to cure.

 18.4 In case of Default by Grantor, the City may exercise remedies as specified in Sections 20 or 21 below, or under any applicable provision of the Easement. In addition to or in lieu of the foregoing, the City shall be entitled to all remedies permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Washington. The City's rights and remedies hereunder are not exclusive, but cumulative, and the City's exercise of any right or remedy due to Grantor's failure to perform any covenant or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of, or alter, affect, or prejudice any other right or remedy that the City may have under this Agreement or by law or in equity.

 19. DEFAULT BY CITY AND REMEDIES

 If, within 30 days after Grantor shall have timely satisfied all conditions to the City's obligation for payment hereunder, the City shall not have tendered to Grantor full payment hereunder, then Grantor may either (1) terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City within 30 days, in which case neither party shall have any liability or obligation hereunder; or (2) pursue any remedy available at law or in equity for enforcement of this Agreement, provided that the City shall not be liable for damages or any other monetary remedy in excess of the total price stated hereunder, plus interest as may be allowed by law.

 20. TERMINATION

 20.1 This Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of the Easement and shall continue in effect until the earliest to occur of:

 (i) The expiration of the Easement Term; or

 (ii) If the Grantee elects to claim liquidated damages after Default in accordance with Section 21 hereof, the date on which Grantee receives full payment of all liquidated damages.

 20.2 The City may terminate this Agreement in the event that, prior to payment by the City hereunder, Grantor is in Default.

 21. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

 21.1 The parties understand and agree that the City's ability to obtain value from the Easement granted is conditioned upon the development and construction of the Property and the completion, opening, and availability for use and occupancy of the Facilities Space. From the nature of this Agreement, it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages sustained as a result of the failure of the Grantor to complete or make available the Facilities Space, or from its use for purposes contrary to the terms of the Easement. As a result, the parties agree that the City shall have the right to recover, at its option, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth herein, which amounts the parties agree are a reasonable estimate of the damage to the City, and are intended to fairly measure the loss to the City and not to be punitive in nature.

 21.2 In the event that the Grantor fails to complete the Facilities Space or otherwise fails to cause the Use Period to commence by the date required herein, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the greater of Six Hundred Nineteen Thousand Dollars ($619,000) or the amount equal to the total of any purchase money already paid by the City, in either case plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date of the purchase of the Easement until the date of payment at the rate applied during the same period of time to the participating funds of the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of the City of Seattle.

 21.3 Additionally, in the event of Default after the beginning of the Use Period and prior to the expiration of the Use Period, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the Forty-One Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($41,667) for each year remaining on the Use Period (prorated for any Partial Use Year based upon the number of free uses not yet used in that year) plus interest on that amount, accrued as described in Section 21.2, for each year remaining in the Easement Term.

 21.4 In the event that Grantor sells or transfers the Property, and in the event that such sale or transfer results in a Default, or in the event that liquidated damages are due and owing as of the date of sale or transfer, the parties agree that the liquidated damages will be a lien for the City's benefit upon the property and against any purchase money received by Grantor from the City.

 21.5 After receipt of liquidated damages in cleared funds, the City shall, within a reasonable time, record an instrument terminating the Easement, and this Agreement shall be terminated.

 21.6 The City may, at its option, set off any liquidated damages under this Section against any amount otherwise payable or distributable by the City to Grantor, whether or not in relation to this Agreement or the Property.

 22. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; INDEMNITY

 22.1 Grantor shall comply at its sole expense with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, Municipal Code, and ordinances of The City of Seattle; and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of their administrative agencies and the officers thereof (all of the foregoing are referred to as "applicable laws"). Grantor shall require all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply with all applicable laws.

 22.2 Grantor represents and warrants that any activities in connection with the development of the Property prior to this Agreement have been in compliance with all applicable laws.

 22.3 Grantor shall defend and indemnify the City and its officers and employees from and against any claim, demand, liability, or loss resulting from the failure of Grantor or of any contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable laws.

 22.4 This Section 22 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 23. APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE

 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in the Superior Court for King County.

 24. HEADINGS

 The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not define or limit the contents.

 25. NOTICES AND REPORTS

 Any notices or reports required or permitted hereunder shall be effective when hand-delivered during normal business hours or two (2) business days after mailed, postage prepaid, to a party at the addresses set forth below, or to such other address as a party shall have provided in accordance with this Section.

 3.1 The Grantor covenants and agrees that from the date hereof through the end of the Use Period, Grantor shall not use the Property, or permit the use of the Property, for any purpose except:

 A. The development and construction of a social service facility as generally described in Exhibit A-1 to the Community Facility Loan Agreement, signed by the City and the Grantor on December 1, 2005, and including on the second floor thereof space substantially as shown on the "Final Design Development / MACC Estimate Set February 28, 2005" by DKA Architects, page A2.4.

 ;

 B. The operation of such facility as a social services and community center, with ancillary activities in support of such uses.

 3.2 After completion of the ACRS Rainier Valley Service Center, and for the duration of the Use Period, the Facilities Space will be used solely to provide or support Social, Health, and Wellness Services that benefit predominantly low- and moderate-income (as defined within 24 C.F.R. Section 570.3) residents of the Rainier Valley and other such residents of South Seattle neighborhoods. Such services may be provided by Grantor and other not-for-profit organizations, governments, public agencies, and others.

 3.3 Grantor shall allow Outside Users seeking to provide Social, Health, and Wellness Services to low- and moderate-income persons access to the Facilities Space to the extent possible, given the needs of Grantor for the space in order to provide such services. To the extent that the Grantor is not itself actively using the Facilities Space for Social, Health, and Wellness Services or ancillary activities in support of such services, Grantor shall so notify the City and use its best efforts to inform Outside Users that the space is available to Outside Users that provide such services.

 Grantor may charge a fee to Outside Users seeking use of space to provide such services, except for any free uses under Section 4 below, but any fee must be at the lowest rate possible, must be affordable to Outside Users whose clients are low- and moderate- income people, and in any event must not be more than the same cost charged for use of space to other community groups as allowed under Section 3.4 below.

 3.4 To the extent consistent with the other provisions of this Easement, Grantor may allow use of all or part of the Facilities Space by community groups, and may charge fees for such use, but any fee shall not be more than the amount necessary to cover the reasonably allocable costs of operating and managing the Facilities Space.

 3.5 Grantor may establish procedures that guide use by Outside Users, including times of operation, the availability of the Facilities Space, codes of conduct, and other policies necessary to efficiently and fairly operate the Facilities Space. Grantor may require that Outside Users of the Facilities Space enter a use agreement provided that the use agreement is designed to ensure safe and equitable access to the Facilities Space, to limit damage to the Facilities Space, and to limit Grantor's risk in operating and managing the Facilities Space.

 3.6 Grantor is solely responsible for maintaining, managing, and operating the Facilities Space according to its own discretion, subject to the terms of this Easement. The Grantor shall maintain the Facilities Space in good condition and repair, and in compliance with all applicable laws, codes, permits, and regulations.

 4. Use Easement. For the duration of the Use Period, the Grantor grants and warrants to the City the rights to use the Facilities Space for itself or its designated Outside Users described in this Section.

 4.1 The City or other Outside Users agreed upon by the City and Grantor shall be entitled to use of the Facilities Space or a portion thereof required by the City or Outside User for a particular use, four (4) times per calendar year free of charge for the duration of the Use Period. The Grantor may recommend to the City, and may collaborate with the City in substituting, Outside Users that will utilize the Use Rights under this Section, based upon Grantor's knowledge of important or critical social, health, or wellness needs of the Rainier Valley or South Seattle low-income community population. The following terms and conditions will apply:

 A. The City or mutually-designated Outside User shall give the Grantor at least fourteen (14) days advance notice of the date and time when the City or such Outside User requires use of the Facilities Space. Such notice shall include the name and contact person of the designated entity to use the space; the hours during which the space is required; what portion of the Facilities Space is required, if not all; the nature and purpose of the use; and the anticipated need for parking on the Property for purposes of the use. The Grantor may request modifications to meet its business needs.

 B. The City or mutually-designated Outside Users, their invitees, and members of the public in the case of uses open to the public, shall have access through such portions of the building as necessary, including elevator, to enter and leave the Facilities Space. Sufficient parking on the Property shall be reserved for those attending the designated use.

 C. The duration of each use shall not exceed four (4) hours, which may be wholly or in part in the evening outside normal working hours, in the City's or other Outside User's discretion. If the use requires that the building be open after normal closing time for Grantor, the City or designated Outside User, respectively, will be responsible for meeting all procedures adopted under Section 3.5 above (subject to Section 4.3 below), for monitoring the building entrance and for securing the building entrance upon completion of the use.

 D. The City or mutually-designated Outside User may place temporary signs on the Property in order to inform the public of the use and direct the public to the appropriate parts of the Facilities Space.

 E. The Grantor shall ensure that the Facilities Space is in clean, safe, and usable condition prior to each free use.

 It may occasionally be desirable, given the nature of the use intended by the City or Outside User, for Grantor to offer, for one or more free uses, the use of other space or spaces within the Property but outside the Facilities Space. Grantor shall give notice of its desire to offer such substitute space no later than seven (7) days prior to the date designated by the City or other Outside User for a free use. Any substitution shall require the consent of the City or the mutually-designated Outside User; however, if the substitute space is comparable to or better than the Facilities Space, or portion thereof designated by the City or other Outside User, in terms of suitability for the intended purpose, the City or other Outside User shall not unreasonably withhold consent to substitution.

 4.2 The number of free uses will be prorated, rounding up, for all Partial Use Years.

 4.3 For purposes of free uses under this Section 4, any policies or guidelines applicable to Outside Users or to use of the Facilities Space, and any use agreement required by Grantor, shall be subject to the written approval of the City, in its discretion, and if not so approved shall not be a condition to any free use.

 4.4 The City or Outside Users, respectively, shall be responsible for leaving the Facilities Space in substantially its prior condition after each use, and for any damage to the Property caused by the use, but the City shall not be responsible for any condition or damage caused in the course of use by Outside Users.

 5. Indemnity.

 Grantor shall have control over and responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of the Property, including the Facilities Space, and the Social, Health, and Wellness Services. As a result, Grantor agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the City of Seattle, its elected officials, officers, employees, and agents harmless from any and all damages, claims, liabilities, losses, and/or costs of any kind, including attorney's fees, that arise in any way from the development, construction, financing, operation, maintenance, or use of the Property, including without limitation any City use, Outside User's use, and/or public use under this Easement, including, but not limited to, City use of the Facilities Space and surrounding grounds and property. This clause applies to claims, liabilities, costs, losses, and/or damages of any kind notwithstanding any acts, omissions, or negligence of the City or its officers, officials, employees, contractors, or agents; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring Grantor to indemnify the City against liability for bodily injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City or of any of its officers, elected officials, employees, or agents, and further provided, that if RCW 4.24.115 (or successor provision) shall apply to any claim for any such damage or injury, then to the extent required by such statute, (1) this indemnity shall not apply in case of any liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the City, its agents or employees, and (2) in case of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of (a) the City or its agents or employees, and (b) Grantor or its agents or employees, this indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Grantor's negligence. The indemnification obligation set forth in this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Easement.

 For purposes of this Section, Grantor waives, solely with respect to City, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance. Grantor and City acknowledge that this waiver has been specifically negotiated and that City would not have entered into the Purchase Agreement absent this waiver.
