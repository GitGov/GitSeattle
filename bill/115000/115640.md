 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the use of interest earnings accumulated in the Capital Facilities Project Fund; increasing an appropriation to the Office of Housing in the 2006 Budget and making a cash transfer, consistent with Ordinance 116105.

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 116105 the City Council authorized issuance of limited tax general obligation (LTGO) bonds in a principal amount not to exceed $35,000,000 to provide for the planning, acquisition, construction, improvement, and rehabilitation of housing, open space, park and recreation facilities, and health facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Capital Facilities Project Fund 33400 ("the Fund") was created for the purpose of administering the bond proceeds and interest earned thereon as a result of this bond issuance; and

 WHEREAS, the proceeds were appropriated to City departments and used to accomplish low-income housing and other capital projects, consistent with the expressed purposes as described in Ordinance 116105, as amended; and

 WHEREAS, the projects intended to be financed by the bonds are now complete, the remaining bonds were refunded in 1998, and it is now appropriate to close the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, there remains in the Fund unspent accumulated interest earnings in the amount of approximately $162,000; and

 WHEREAS, the interest accumulated on the bond proceeds is eligible to be appropriated for a project included in the Capital Facilities Element of the City's Comprehensive Plan including capital purposes relating to low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, the 2006 federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) entitlement received by the City in 2006 is less than anticipated in the 2006 Adopted Budget, and the interest accumulated on the bond proceeds presents an eligible funding source to offset the reduction in CDBG entitlement; and

 WHEREAS, the Human Services Department is submitting as companion legislation the Substantial Amendment to the Consolidated Plan to amend the City's 2006 CDBG spending plan as described in the 2006 Update to the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan, and the Substantial Amendment legislation proposes use of these funds to maintain program levels for low-income housing in 2006; NOW, THEREFORE,
