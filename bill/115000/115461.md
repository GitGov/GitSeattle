 ATTACHMENT A

 Memorandum of Agreement

 Regarding Voluntary Contribution for Stormwater Treatment

 At Rainier Vista and New Holly Phase III

 This Memorandum of Agreement ("MOA") Regarding Stormwater Treatment is entered into by and between Seattle Housing Authority, herein referred to as the "Applicant" and the CITY OF SEATTLE, herein referred to as the "City."

Recitals

 A. The Applicant has applied for two permits to redevelop mixed income housing herein referred to as the "Project Proposals." The Project Proposals consist of:

 * Master Use Permit No. 2000638 known as the community at Rainier Vista (Plat No.: 20031028002277), and

 * Master Use Permit No. 2002764 known as the community at Othello Station (Plat No.: 20030724002293), or New Holly Phase III.

 B. The Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") requires stormwater treatment facilities "to be installed and maintained to treat that portion of the site being developed" (SMC 22.802.016) for roadway surface accessible by vehicle and uncovered portions of paved driveways and parking lots (City of Seattle Stormwater Treatment Technical Requirements Manual, DCLU Director's Rule 27-2000 and SPU Director's Rule 04-00 (November 2000. If constructed on site, the stormwater treatment facility for the Project Proposal would treat approximately 8.61 acres (1.38 acres for Rainier Vista and 7.23 acres for New Holly Phase III) of impervious surface subject to vehicular use.

 C. DCLU Director's Rule 27-2000 provides for the use of an Integrated Drainage Plan. An Integrated Drainage Plan "substitutes water quality treatment from one or more projects through the design of and installation of off-site facilities within a basin draining to the same receiving water body. Participation in an Integrated Drainage Plan must be approved by the Director of SPU through an agreement that includes specific applicant contributions and a construction start date not to exceed five years from the date of approval."

 D. The City desires to construct stormwater treatment facilities within a basin draining to the same receiving water body that would provide equivalent or greater stormwater treatment than on-site facilities.

 E. In lieu of constructing an on-site stormwater treatment facility and in satisfaction of the City's requirement regarding on-site stormwater treatment for the Project Proposals, the Applicant desires to pay to the City the anticipated cost of constructing on-site stormwater treatment facilities, for the City's use in constructing the off-site stormwater treatment facilities described above.

 F. RCW 82.02.020 currently provides that the funds must be expended within five (5) years from the date the funds are transferred to the designated SPU capital improvement reserve account. If the funds are not expended on the agreed-upon capital improvement, then the funds shall be returned to the Applicant with interest in the amount required by RCW 82.02.020(3), as may be amended, except that if the funds are not expended upon the agreed upon capital improvement within five years due to delay attributable to the Applicant, the funds shall be refunded without interest.

Agreement

 1. Direct Impact. The City and the Applicant agree that the development of the Project Proposals will directly impact the quality of stormwater discharging to the receiving water bodies and that this impact can only be mitigated by stormwater treatment, either on-site or off-site.

 2. Off-Site Facilities. The City and the Applicant agree that the City-constructed off-site stormwater treatment facilities will satisfy the stormwater treatment requirements for the Project Proposals. This is consistent with Section 1.1.4 of the City of Seattle Stormwater Treatment Technical Requirements Manual, DCLU Director's Rule 27-2000 and SPU Director's Rule 04-00 (November 2000).

 3. Contribution and Capital Improvement Project. The Applicant voluntarily agrees to pay the City $1,700,000 based on the estimated cost of providing on-site facilities for the Project Proposals. If the cost of the City-constructed off-site stormwater treatment facilities exceeds $1.7 million, the Applicant voluntarily agrees to contribute 50% of the additional costs up to an additional total cost to the applicant of $25,000. The Applicant's total potential contribution by project is as follows:

 Rainier Vista:

 Capital Cost Contribution (committed) $1,000.000

Possible Contingency (if needed) 12,500

Total Contribution Potential $1,012,500

 New Holly Phase III

 Capital Cost Contribution (committed) $700,000

Possible Contingency (if needed) 12,500

Total Contribution Potential $712,500

 The Applicant and the City agree that these funds are for the City's use in constructing a stormwater treatment facility or facilities for stormwater runoff from vehicular impervious surfaces within the basin draining to the same receiving water body as the Project Proposals.

 4. Approval of MOA . This Agreement shall not be effective until approval of the Agreement by ordinance of the City. The Applicant's contribution is due and payable to the City within 60 days after City Council passing of said ordinance.

 5. Satisfaction of Stormwater Treatment Requirements. After execution of this Agreement, after approval by City ordinance, and upon actual payment of funds to the City, the Applicant shall be deemed to have satisfied the stormwater treatment requirements for the Project Proposals.

 6. Additional Requirements. This agreement is not intended to modify the temporary detention for the Project Proposals that has been and continues to be required at Rainier Vista until the site drainage is connected to a public storm drain system.

 7. Indemnification. The City agrees to indemnify the applicant from third party claims arising from the design or operation of off- site storm water treatment facilities constructed by the City pursuant to this Agreement.
