 PROJECT 500 AREA, FORT LAWTON U.S. ARMY RESERVE CENTER

 KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON

 This QUITCLAIM DEED, is made between the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (hereinafter the "GRANTOR"), acting by and through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations & Housing), pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Secretary of the Army (hereinafter the "ARMY"), under the authority of section 2842 of Public Law 106-398, and the City of Seattle (hereinafter the "GRANTEE").

 WITNESSETH THAT the GRANTOR, for and in consideration of the inclusion of the Property in Discovery Park, Seattle, Washington and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of all of which is hereby acknowledged, does hereby REMISE, RELEASE, CONVEY AND FOREVER QUITCLAIM unto the GRANTEE and its assigns, all its right, title, and interest in the Property, containing approximately 11.92 acres and more particularly described in Exhibit A, attached hereto and made a part hereof (hereinafter referred to as the "Property").

 SUBJECT TO all valid and existing restrictions, reservations, covenants, conditions, and easements, including but not limited to rights-of-way for railroads, highways, pipelines, and public utilities, if any, whether of public record or not.

 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Property granted herein to the GRANTEE and its assigns, together with all and singular the appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anywise appertaining, and all the estate, right, title, interest, or claim whatsoever of the GRANTOR, either in law or in equity and subject to the terms, reservations, restrictions, covenants, and conditions set forth in this Quitclaim Deed.

 AND IT IS FURTHER AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD by and between the parties hereto that the GRANTEE, by its acceptance of this Quitclaim Deed, agrees that, as part of the consideration for this Quitclaim Deed, the GRANTEE covenants and agrees for itself and its assigns, forever, that this Quitclaim Deed is made and accepted upon each of the following covenants, which covenants shall be binding upon and enforceable against the GRANTEE and its assigns, in perpetuity by the United States and other interested parties as allowed by federal, state or local law; that the NOTICES, USE RESTRICTIONS, AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS set forth here are a binding servitude on the Property herein conveyed and shall be deemed to run with the land in perpetuity; and that the failure to include the NOTICES, USE RESTRICTIONS, AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS in subsequent conveyances does not abrogate the status of these restrictions as binding upon the parties and their assigns.

 CERCLA NOTICE

 Pursuant to section 120(h)(3)(A)(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (hereinafter CERCLA)(42 U.S.C. 9620), and to the extent such information is available on the basis of a complete search of Department of the Army files, notice is hereby provided that no hazardous substance is known to have been stored for one year or more, or to have been released or disposed of on the Property in excess of reportable quantities as provided in 40 C.F.R. Part 373.

 CERCLA COVENANT

 Pursuant to Section (h) (3) (A) (ii) and (B) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. section9620), the United States warrants that -

 A. All remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any hazardous substance identified pursuant to section (h)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 remaining on the Property has been taken before the date of this quitclaim deed, and

 B. Any additional remedial action found to be necessary after the date of this quitclaim deed shall be conducted by the United States.

 This warranty shall not apply in any case in which the person or entity to whom the Property is transferred is a potentially responsible party with respect to such Property. For purposes of this warranty, Grantee shall not be considered a potentially responsible party solely due to the presence of a hazardous substance remaining on the Property on the date of this instrument, provided that Grantee has not caused or contributed to a release of such hazardous substance.

 RIGHT OF ACCESS

 A. Pursuant to section (h)(3)(A)(iii) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. section 9620), the United States retains and reserves a perpetual and assignable easement and right of access on, over, and through the Property, to enter upon the Property in any case in which an environmental response action or corrective action is found to be necessary on the part of the United States, without regard to whether such environmental response action or corrective action is on the Property or on adjoining or nearby lands. Such easement and right of access includes, without limitation, the right to perform any environmental investigation, survey, monitoring, sampling, testing, drilling, boring, coring, test-pitting, installing monitoring or pumping wells or other treatment facilities, response action, corrective action, or any other action necessary for the United States to meet its responsibilities under applicable laws and as provided for in this instrument. Such easement and right of access shall be binding on the Grantee and its assigns, and shall run with the land.

 B. In exercising such easement and right of access, the United States shall provide the Grantee or its assigns, as the case may be, with reasonable notice of its intent to enter upon the Property and exercise its rights under this covenant, which notice may be severely curtailed or even eliminated in emergency situations. The United States shall use reasonable means, but without significant additional costs to the United States, to avoid and to minimize interference with the Grantee's and the Grantee's assigns' quiet enjoyment of the Property. Such easement and right of access includes the right to obtain and use utility services, including water, gas, electricity, sewer, and communications services available on the Property at a reasonable charge to the United States. Excluding the reasonable charges for such utility services, no fee, charge, or compensation will be due the Grantee nor its assigns, for the exercise of the easement and right of access hereby retained and reserved by the United States.

 C. In exercising such easement and right of access, neither the Grantee nor its assigns, as the case may be, shall have any claim at law or equity against the United States or any officer, employee, agent, contractor of any tier, or servant of the United States based on actions taken by the United States or its officers, employees, agents, contractors of any tier, or servants pursuant to and in accordance with this covenant. In addition, the Grantee and its assigns, shall not interfere with any response action or corrective action conducted by the Grantor on the Property.

 PETROLEUM PRODUCT STORAGE, RELEASE, OR DISPOSAL

 Notification of Petroleum product storage, release, or disposal is more particularly described in Exhibit B, attached hereto and made a part hereof.

 DISTURBANCE OF SOILS AND HYDROLOGY RESTRICTIONS

 A. The following restrictions and conditions apply to the northeast portion of the Property, more particularly described at Exhibit C, attached hereto and made a part hereof, where petroleum-contaminated subsurface soils have been left in place. The Grantee covenants for itself and its assigns not to: 1. advance soil borings into the subsurface; 2. install groundwater wells; or 3. disturb the soil covering more than 15 feet below ground surface. For the purpose of this restriction, "groundwater" shall have the same meaning as in section 101(12) of CERCLA (42 USC 9620). These restrictions and covenants are binding on the Grantee and its successors, run with the land, and are forever enforceable.

 B. Enforcement. The restrictions and conditions stated in section A above benefit the public in general and the territories surrounding the Property, including lands retained by the United States, and, therefore, are enforceable by the United States government. The Grantee covenants for itself and its assigns that it shall include and otherwise make legally binding these restrictions in all subsequent lease, transfer, or conveyance documents relating to this Property or any part thereof.

 "AS IS"

 A. The GRANTEE acknowledges that it has inspected or has had the opportunity to inspect the Property and accepts the condition and state of repair of the subject Property. The GRANTEE understands and agrees that the Property and any part thereof is offered "AS IS" without any representation, warranty, or guaranty by the GRANTOR as to quantity, quality, title, character, condition, size, or kind, or that the same is in condition or fit to be used for the purpose(s) intended by the GRANTEE, and no claim for allowance or deduction upon such grounds will be considered.

 B. No warranties, either express or implied, are given with regard to the condition of the Property. The GRANTEE shall be deemed to have relied solely on its own judgment in assessing the overall condition of all or any portion of the Property. The failure of the GRANTEE to inspect or to exercise due diligence to be fully informed as to the condition of all or any portion of the Property conveyed, will not constitute grounds for any claim or demand against the United States of America.

 C. Nothing in this "As Is" provision will be construed to modify or negate the GRANTOR'S obligation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act Covenant or any other statutory obligations.

 HOLD HARMLESS

 A. To the extent authorized by law, the GRANTEE and its assigns, covenant and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the GRANTOR, its officers, agents, and employees from (i.) any and all claims, damages, judgments, losses, and costs, including fines and penalties, arising out of the violation of the notices, use restrictions, and restrictive covenants as set forth in this Quitclaim Deed by the GRANTEE and its assigns, and (ii.) any and all claims, damages, and judgments arising out of, or in any manner predicated upon, exposure to asbestos, lead-based paint, or other condition on any portion of the Property after the date of conveyance.

 B. The GRANTEE and its assigns covenant and agree that the GRANTOR shall not be responsible for any costs associated with modification or termination of the notices, use restrictions, and restrictive covenants as set forth in this Quitclaim Deed.

 C. Nothing in this Hold Harmless provision will be construed to modify or negate the GRANTOR'S obligation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act Covenant or any other statutory obligations.

 POST-TRANSFER DISCOVERY OF CONTAMINATION

 A. If an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance or petroleum product is discovered on the Property after the date of conveyance, the GRANTEE or its assign(s), shall be responsible for such release or newly discovered substance unless the GRANTEE or its assign(s) are able to demonstrate that such release or such newly discovered substance was due to GRANTOR'S activities, use, or ownership of the Property. If the GRANTEE, it successors or assigns believe the discovered hazardous substance is due to GRANTOR'S activities, use or ownership of the Property, GRANTEE will immediately secure the site and notify the GRANTOR of the existence of the hazardous substances, and GRANTEE will not further disturb such hazardous substances without the written permission of the GRANTOR.

 B. The GRANTEE and its assigns, as consideration for the conveyance of the Property, agree to release the GRANTOR from any liability or responsibility for any claims arising solely out of the release of any hazardous substance or petroleum product on the Property occurring after the date of the delivery and acceptance of this Quitclaim Deed, where such substance or product was placed on the Property by the GRANTEE, or its assigns, employees, invitees, agents or contractors, after the conveyance. This paragraph shall not affect the GRANTOR'S responsibilities to conduct response actions or corrective actions that are required by applicable laws, rules and regulations, or the GRANTOR'S indemnification obligations under applicable laws.

 NOTICE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR THE PRESENCE OF MUNITIONS AND EXPLOSIVES OF CONCERN:

 Based on a review of existing records and available information, there is no evidence that Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) are on the Property. However as with any former military installation there is always a potential for MEC to be present on the Property. MEC, which distinguishes specific categories of military munitions that may pose unique explosives safety risks, means: (a.) unexploded ordnance, as defined in 10 U.S.C. Section 101(e) (5); (b.) discarded military munitions, as defined in 10 U.S.C. Section 2710 (e) (2); or (c.) explosive munitions constituents, as defined in 10 U.S.C. Section 2710 (e) (3), present in high enough concentrations to pose an explosive hazard. In the event the GRANTEE or its assigns, should discover any MEC on the Property, it/he/she/they shall not attempt to remove or destroy it, but shall immediately notify the local Sheriff's Department or Police Department and competent GRANTOR or GRANTOR designated explosive ordnance personnel will be dispatched promptly to dispose of such ordnance at no expense to the GRANTEE or its assigns.

 NON-DISCRIMINATION

 The GRANTEE covenants for itself and its assigns and every successor in interest to the Property hereby conveyed, or any part thereof, that the said GRANTEE and such successors, and assigns shall not discriminate upon the basis of race, color, religion, age, gender, or national origin in the use, occupancy, sale, or lease of the Property, or in their employment practices conducted thereon. This covenant shall not apply, however, to the lease or rental of a room or rooms within a family dwelling unit; nor shall it apply with respect to religion to premises used primarily for religious purposes. The United States of America shall be deemed a beneficiary of this covenant without regard to whether it remains the owner of any land or interest therein in the locality of the Property hereby conveyed and shall have the sole right to enforce this covenant in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 ANTI-DEFICIENCY ACT

 The GRANTOR's obligation to pay or reimburse any money under this Quitclaim Deed is subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this purpose to the Department of the Army, and nothing in this Quitclaim Deed shall be interpreted to require obligations or payments by the GRANTOR in violation of the Anti- Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. section1341.

 NO WAIVER

 The failure of the Government to insist in any one or more instances upon complete performance of any of the said notices, covenants, conditions, restrictions, or reservations shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of the future performance of any such covenants, conditions, restrictions, or reservations; but the obligations of the GRANTEE and its assigns, with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and effect.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the GRANTOR has caused this Quitclaim Deed to be executed in its name by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Housing (I&H), this the _____ day of __________________ 200_.
