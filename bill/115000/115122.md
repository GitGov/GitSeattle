 20.70.050 Procedures

 A. Notice of Investigation.

 The Director or any Contracting Authority may initiate an investigation of a Contractor. The Director or Contracting Authority shall notify the Contractor in writing that an investigation has been initiated and the allegations that form the basis for the investigation. The Notice of Investigation shall be either personally served or sent by certified mail. The Contractor shall have 21 days from the Date of Service of the notice of investigation and allegations on the Contractor to file an answer to the allegations.

 B. Investigation Results.

 The results of the investigation shall be in writing and shall state, at a minimum, the allegation(s), the conclusion(s) reached regarding the allegation(s), the facts upon which the conclusion(s) are based, and the investigator's recommendation, including a recommended length of Debarment, if any. If the investigator is a Contracting Authority, it shall forward the results of the investigation to the Director. The Director shall personally serve or send by certified or regular mail, the results of the investigation to the Contractor.

 C. Findings and Notice of Debarment.

 The Director shall consider both the results of the investigation and the Contractor's answer, if any, to the allegation(s). The Director shall make a preliminary determination on whether the Contractor should be Debarred within six (6) months of the Date of Service of the Notice of Investigation and provide the Contractor with findings, or the matter will be dismissed, unless the Director provides notice to the Contractor that there is good cause to extend the period of investigation for an additional determined period time. If, after reviewing the results of the investigation and the Contractor's answer to the allegations, the Director determines that a Contractor should be Debarred, the Director shall notify the Respondent of the City's intent to issue an Order of Debarment. The Notice of Debarment shall be in writing, and shall be either personally served or sent by certified mail. The Notice of Debarment shall include:

 1. A statement that the City intends to issue an Order of Debarment prohibiting the Respondent from submitting a bid or proposal on a Contract with the City and from acting as a Contractor or subcontractor on a Contract with the City;

 2. A statement of the reasons for Debarment, including the allegation(s), the conclusion(s) reached regarding the allegation(s), and the facts upon which the conclusion(s) are based;

 3. The proposed length of Debarment;

 4. Information on how the Respondent can contest the Notice.

 If the Director determines that the Contractor should not be debarred, the Director shall issue a written determination to that effect.

 D. Notice Protest

 1. A Respondent may contest the Notice of Debarment by filing a written Notice Protest with the Director no later than 14 calendar days after the Date of Service of the Notice of Debarment. Unless waived by the Director, filing a Notice Protest is an administrative remedy that the Respondent must exhaust before seeking judicial review.

 2. If the Respondent does not timely contest the Notice of Debarment, the Director shall issue an Order of Debarment, which shall set forth:

 a. The contracting activities from which the Respondent is barred from participating;

 b. The length of the Debarment;

 c. A brief statement of the facts upon which the Debarment is based; and,

 d. A response to any written comments submitted by the Respondent.

The Notice Protest must state the reasons why the Notice of Debarment is erroneous, provide copies of any documents that support the Respondent's arguments, provide the names and/or sworn written statements of all witnesses that have knowledge of relevant information related to the proposed Debarment, identify any other specific information that supports the Respondent's arguments, and specify a desired remedy.

 4. The Director shall consider the Notice of Debarment and the Respondent's Notice Protest. The Contractor may provide its protest in writing, or may provide a written protest and request a hearing to discuss the protest. If a hearing is held, the Department shall have the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the grounds exist for an Order of Debarment.

 5. The Director shall issue a final decision and Order regarding whether the Contractor should be Debarred. If the Director issues an Order of Debarment, that Order shall state:

 a. The contracting activities from which the Respondent is barred from participating;

 b. The length of the Debarment; and

 c. Findings and conclusions upon which the Debarment is based.

 The Director's decision shall be the final administrative decision of the City.
