 10.52.031 - Citation

 1. The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued;

 2. A reasonable description of the location of the property on which the violation occurred;

 3. A separate statement of each standard or requirement violated;

 4. The date of the violation;

 5. A statement that the person cited must respond to the citation within fifteen (15) days after service;

 6. A space for entry of the applicable penalty;

 7. A statement that a response must be received at the Office of Hearing Examiner not later than five p.m. on the date the response is due;

 8. The name, address and phone number of the Office of Hearing Examiner where the citation is to be filed;

 9. A statement that the citation represents a determination that a violation has been committed by the person named in the citation and that the determination shall be final unless contested as provided in this chapter; and

 10. A certified statement of the inspector issuing the citation, authorized by RCW 9A72.085, setting forth facts supporting issuance of the citation.

 B. Service. The citation may be served by personal service in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s). Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, on the date of mailing. If a citation sent by first class mail is returned as undeliverable, service may be made by posting the citation at a conspicuous place on the property.

 Section 2. A new section 10.52.032 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 10.52.032 - Response to citations.

 A. A person must respond to a citation in one (1) of the following ways:

 1. Paying the amount of the monetary penalty specified in the citation, in which case the record shall show a finding that the person cited committed the violation; or

 2. Requesting in writing a mitigation hearing to explain the circumstances surrounding the commission of the violation and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing maybe sent; or

 3. Requesting a contested hearing in writing specifying the reason why the cited violation did not occur or why the person cited is not responsible for the violation, and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent.

 B. A response to a citation must be received by the Office of the Hearing Examiner no later than fifteen (15) days after the date the citation is served. When the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until five p.m. on the next business day.

 Section 3. A new section 10.52.033 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 10.52.033 - Failure to respond.

 If a person fails to respond to a citation within fifteen (15) days of service, an order shall be entered by the Hearing Examiner finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation, and assessing the penalty specified in the citation.

 Section 4. A new section 10.52.034 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 10.52.034 Mitigation hearings.

 A. Date and Notice. If a person requests a mitigation hearing, the mitigation hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received by the Hearing Examiner. Notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing will be sent by first class mail to the address provided in the request for hearing not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing.

 B. Procedure at Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall hold an informal hearing, which shall not be governed by the Rules of Evidence. The person cited may present witnesses, but witnesses may not be compelled to attend. A representative from DPD may also be present and may present additional information, but attendance by a representative from DPD is not required.

 C. Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the person's explanation justifies reduction of the monetary penalty; however, the monetary penalty may not be reduced unless DPD affirms or certifies that the violation has been corrected prior to the mitigation hearing. Factors that may be considered in whether to reduce the penalty include whether the violation was caused by the act or neglect of another; or whether correction of the violation was commenced promptly prior to citation but that full compliance was prevented by a condition or circumstance beyond the control of the person cited.

 D. Entry of Order. After hearing the explanation of the person cited and any other information presented at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and assessing a monetary penalty in an amount determined pursuant to this section. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City on this matter.

 Section 5. A new section 10.52.035 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 10.52.035 - Contested case hearing.

 A. Date and Notice. If a person requests a contested case hearing, the hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days after the written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received.

 B. Hearing. Contested case hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases, except as modified by this section. The issues heard at the hearing shall be limited to those raised in writing in the response to the citation and that are within the jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.

 C. Sufficiency. No citation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation which the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such lack of detail, or defects or imperfections do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.

 D. Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.

 E. Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 to be submitted by an inspector shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. The certified statement or declaration of the inspector authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 and any other evidence accompanying the report shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the DPD evidence and establish that the cited violation(s) did not occur or that the person contesting the citation is not responsible for the violation.

 F. Disposition. If the citation is sustained at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation. If the violation remains uncorrected, the Hearing Examiner shall impose the applicable penalty. The Hearing Examiner may reduce the monetary penalty in accordance with the mitigation provisions in Section 10.52.034 if the violation has been corrected. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the citation.

 G. Appeal. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City. Any judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision in accordance with RCW 36.70C.040.

 Section 6. A new section 10.52.036 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 10.52.036 - Failure to appear for hearing.

 Failure to appear for a requested hearing will result in an order being entered finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation and assessing the penalty specified in the citation. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.

 Section 7. A new section 10.52.037 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 10.52.037 Penalties.

 A. First Violation. The first time that a person or entity is found to have violated one of the provisions referenced in SMC 10.52.030 after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the person or entity shall be subject to a penalty of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150).

 B. Second and Subsequent Violations. Any subsequent time that a person or entity is found to have violated one (1) of the provisions referenced in Section 10.52.030 within a five (5)year period after the first violation, the person or entity shall be subject to a penalty of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) for each such violation.

 10.52.042 - Additional relief.

 The Director may seek legal or equitable relief at any time to enjoin any acts or practices or abate any condition that violates the provisions referenced in this Chapter.

 Section 12. A new Section 10.52.051 of the Seattle Municipal Code is adopted as follows:

 10.52.051 Collection of penalties.

 If the person cited fails to pay a penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter, the penalty may be referred to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the judgment. Alternatively, the City may pursue collection in any other manner allowed by law.

 Section 13. Sections 10.52.050, 10.52.080, and 10.52.090 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which sections were adopted by Ordinance 114355, are hereby repealed.
