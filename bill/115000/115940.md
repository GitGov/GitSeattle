 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE establishing a City Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board by adding new sections to Subchapter III of Chapter 3.14 SMC.

 WHEREAS, Seattle is home to individuals of diverse heritage with over 100,000 foreign-born individuals of numerous nationalities; and

 WHEREAS, the City seeks to make government services and resources easily available and understandable to all Seattle residents, including non-native English speakers; and

 WHEREAS, many Seattle residents speak English as a second language or are non-English speakers and face additional challenges in understanding eligibility for benefits and participating in government programs; and

 WHEREAS, the City has developed an Immigrant and Refugee Action Plan that identifies current efforts and establishes actions the City plans to take to provide equal access to City services and programs to Seattle's immigrant and refugee residents; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council recognize the complex and dynamic nature of issues that impact the immigrant and refugee communities in Seattle, and the City could benefit from additional expertise to inform and advise officials of ways to enhance and improve access to City services and resources; and

 WHERAS, in September 2005 the City Council adopted Resolution 30796 calling for an action plan to identify and address issues facing Seattle's immigrant and refugee communities and establishment of a community advisory task force to advise the City; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor's Immigrant and Refugee Action Plan recommends the creation of an Advisory Board; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subchapter III of Chapter 3.14 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to add the following sections:

 3.14.540. Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board Established

 There is established an Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board. The Office of Policy and Management shall provide staff and meeting space to the Board, and shall maintain its records.

 3.14.550. Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board - Purposes and Duties

 The Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board shall act in an advisory capacity, and shall have the following purposes and duties:

 A. To advise the Mayor, City Council and other departments and offices on ways to enhance and improve access to City services and resources for immigrants and refugees, as well as strengthen opportunities for immigrants and refugees to participate in the civic life of the City;

 B. To advise the City concerning the successful implementation of the Immigrant and Refugee Action Plan and on future updates to the plan;

 C. To advise all departments and offices of the City in matters affecting immigrants and refugees, as appropriate; and

 D. To encourage understanding between and among the various immigrant and refugee communities and the larger Seattle community.

 3.14.560 Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board - Appointments,

 Membership and Terms

 A. The Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board shall consist of fifteen (15) members. Seven (7) members shall be appointed by the City Council; and eight (8) members shall be appointed by the Mayor. All appointments are subject to confirmation by a majority of the City Council. The appointing body shall provide written public notice for a vacant position (s).

 B. In making appointments to the Board, the goal should be to maintain the gender balance and reflect the diversity of the immigrant and refugee community in Seattle, and attempts should be made to include two (2) members from the Asian / Pacific Islander Community, two (2) members from the Latino Community, two (2) members from the African Community, and two (2) members from the European/Middle East Community. At least, two (2) members should be youth or young adults under the age of 25 or represent youth issues. At least two thirds (2/3) of the members should be immigrants and refugees themselves. All members shall demonstrate experience or expertise with immigrant issues as well as commitment to all immigrant and refugee communities. The Mayor and Council will coordinate appointments to help achieve the representation goals in this Subsection.

 C. Each Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board member shall serve for a term of two (2) years; provided, however, that three (3) of the initial Mayoral appointees and three (3) of the initial City Council appointees shall serve initial terms of one (1) year, to provide for staggered terms. The initial terms shall begin no later than January 2008 following the passage of this legislation creating the Board. No member of the Board shall serve more than two consecutive terms. Any vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as originally appointed. If a person is appointed to fill the duration of an unexpired term, then that term shall qualify as one (1) of the two (2) consecutive terms only if the portion of the unexpired term actually served is one (1) year or more. If the appointing authority fails to appoint or re-appoint a person to fill a Board position before the incumbent Board member's term has expired, then the incumbent may remain in his or her position for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days until such appointment or re- appointment is made. The authority that appointed a Board member may remove that Board member at will. The Board may, by majority vote, recommend to the appointing authority, removal from office of a Board member who is absent without excuse from three (3) Board meetings during any one (1)-year period. The Board shall select a chair, and may adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind administrative rules and regulations for its own conduct. No employee of the City of Seattle shall serve on the Board.

 3.14.570 Annual Work Plan

 The Immigrant and Refugee Advisory Board will develop an Annual Workplan for the coming year and an Annual Report on the previous year's work. The Annual Report will include a summary of Board accomplishments and challenges, as well as recommendations on how the City can continue to facilitate access to City services and programs and strengthen the City's Immigrant and Refugee Action Plan. The Board will brief the Mayor's Executive Team and the City Council on the Annual Workplan and Annual Report.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
