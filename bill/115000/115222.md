 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the sale of the Alaska Building; declaring property at 618 Second Avenue, commonly known as the Alaska Building, under the jurisdiction of the Fleets and Facilities Department, to be surplus to the City's needs; authorizing the sale and a temporary leaseback of certain portions of said property; designating the disposition of sale proceeds; and making appropriations of sale proceeds; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, in March 1988, Ordinance 113875 authorized the acquisition of the historic Alaska and Arctic Buildings; and

 WHEREAS, in July 1995, Ordinance 117739 authorized the purchase of Key Tower, now Seattle Municipal Tower, for housing general government, City Light, and other utility offices; and

 WHEREAS, in July, 1998, Resolution 29795 provided guidance for the creation of a Municipal Civic Center Master Plan, which included researching re-use strategies for the Alaska and Arctic Buildings, including schedules and disposition strategies; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle established a Civic Center Client Group, which includes three Councilmembers, the Deputy Mayor, the Finance Director, and the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department, to oversee the implementation of the Civic Center Master Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Master Plan envisioned the sale of the Alaska Building and upgrade of the Arctic Building for City occupancy; and

 WHEREAS, a 2004 analysis of the Arctic Building indicated the building would require more seismic upgrades and major maintenance than previously contemplated, resulting in a Civic Center Client Group recommendation that it was prudent to sell both the Alaska and Arctic Buildings; and

 WHEREAS, one of the Civic Center Master Plan's goals is to realize revenue from the sale or lease of assets that are no longer needed to meet the City's space needs; and

 WHEREAS, the Fleets and Facilities Department, offered the Alaska and Arctic Buildings for sale through an open, competitive process; and

 WHEREAS, a 2004 review of City space requirements resulted in a Civic Center Client Group recommendation that space needs for those City offices currently occupying the Alaska and Arctic Buildings be served through a combination of City-owned space in the Seattle Municipal Tower and privately owned and leased space in the Second or Third Avenue corridor; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of the City's competitive process, Alaska Building, LLC has agreed to pay a purchase price of $8,500,000 in cash at closing and intends to redevelop the Alaska Building into residential units, subject to the historic preservation requirements associated with the building; and

 WHEREAS, the schedule for relocating City departments from the Alaska Building contemplates that the City will execute leases with the purchaser of this Buildings and continue to occupy certain portions of the Building for certain temporary periods after the sale closes; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Alaska Building should be reserved and used to pay a portion of the 2005/2006 occupancy costs for downtown office space, to address expense and revenue adjustments associated with the sale of the Building which could not be anticipated in the development of the 2005 Adopted Budget and 2006 Endorsed Budget; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Alaska Building should be reserved to pay those costs associated with relocating City departments that are not already budgeted in the Municipal Civic Center Fund; and

 WHEREAS, that portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Alaska Building that is required to defease outstanding tax-exempt bonds issued by the City to refinance the City's purchase of the Alaska Building should be reserved and applied for that purpose;

 2. ACCESS. The City shall allow the Lessor or the Lessor's agent free access at all reasonable times to said Premises to inspect, clean, or make repairs, additions or alterations to the Premises or any connected property owned by or under the control of the Lessor. This provision shall not be construed as an agreement on the part of the Lessor to make such repairs, additions or alterations nor a waiver of the City's right of quiet enjoyment. All such work by the Lessor shall be undertaken in a way so as to minimize interference with the City's use of the Premises.

 3. UTILITIES AND OTHER SERVICES. Unless otherwise specified in Part A, hereof, the Lessor, at the Lessor's sole expense, shall provide or shall otherwise pay for, when due, all costs for providing all utilities and other services on or to the Premises including but not limited to elevator service, electricity, gas, water, sewer, garbage, heating and cooling or air conditioning, janitorial, and building security.

 5. MAINTENANCE - REPAIRS. The Premises have been inspected by both parties and are accepted by the City in their existing condition as of the commencement date of this lease, without reservation except for latent defects or faulty construction of the Premises not discoverable by inspection at the time of taking possession. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the Lessor, at its sole expense, shall keep and preserve the Premises in good repair, including but not limited to all structural and non-structural parts thereof, elevators, plumbing, heating, cooling, and electrical, gas and other utility systems; and other equipment and appurtenances of the Premises and the structure of which the Premises form a part.

 6. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. In the event the Premises are damaged by fire, earthquake, act of war, or other extraordinary casualty to such an extent as to render the same untenantable in whole or in a substantial part thereof, or are destroyed, it shall be optional with the Lessor to repair or rebuild the same, and after the happening of any such event, the City shall give the Lessor or the Lessor's agent written notice thereof within forty-eight (48) hours of such occurrence. The Lessor shall have not more than ten (10) days after the date of such notification to notify the City in writing of the Lessor's intentions to repair or rebuild said Premises; and if the Lessor elects to repair or rebuild said Premises, the Lessor shall prosecute the work of such repairing or rebuilding without unnecessary delay. During any period in which the Premises are rendered unfit for occupancy because of any such casualty, the rent of said Premises shall be abated in the same ratio that the portion of the Premises rendered for the time being unfit for occupancy bears to the whole of the Premises.

 7. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW
