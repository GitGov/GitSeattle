 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities' Cedar River Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) Downstream Habitat Protection and Restoration Program; amending that department's Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat with Cascade Land Conservancy.

 WHEREAS, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) was authorized to enter into an Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat (Agreement) with Cascade Land Conservancy (CLC) to acquire fish habitat lands in the lower Cedar River to satisfy the City's HCP commitments; and

 WHEREAS, the Agreement authorizes SPU to convey to CLC a conservation- stewardship easement, which obligates CLC to protect and provide stewardship for the acquired properties for the term of the HCP (through 2050); and

 WHEREAS, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF), administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, makes grants available to States, under the HCP Land Acquisition Grant Program, to support land acquisitions by State and local governments that complement actions associated with an HCP; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), working in collaboration with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, solicited 2005 CESCF grant proposals for projects located in Washington State; and

 WHEREAS, SPU submitted a grant proposal and has been awarded a CESCF grant (titled "Cedar River Phase 3 Acquisitions") under the HCP Land Acquisition Grant Program for acquisition of lands and the protection and preservation of fish and wildlife habitat along the lower reaches of the Cedar River, below the City's municipal watershed ownership boundary; and

 WHEREAS, the terms of the Project Grant Agreement (No. 06-1321) with WDFW require that the properties be "managed in perpetuity to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and the species listed in the proposal" and prohibit SPU from conveying any property interest in lands acquired with CESCF grant funding to other parties, including CLC; and

 WHEREAS, SPU desires to retain CLC to provide stewardship services for lands acquired with CESCF funding without conveying a conservation- stewardship easement to CLC; and

 WHEREAS, SPU seeks to expand the list of target acquisition parcels under this program to improve its ability to find willing sellers of property that contains high fish habitat values and habitat restoration potential;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of SPU or his designee is hereby authorized to accept, execute, deliver and perform, on behalf of the City of Seattle, the Amendment to the Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat with Cascade Land Conservancy, substantially in the form shown in Attachment 1.

 SPU CLC Contract Amendment

 January 22, 2007

 Version #4

 1 ATTACHMENT 1 TO ORDINANCE

 AGREEMENT TO AMEND

 THE

 AGREEMENT FOR ACQUISTION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISH HABITAT

 This Agreement amends the Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat ("Agreement") by and between the City of Seattle ("City") and the Cascade Land Conservancy ("CLC")(jointly, "Parties"), entered into on the _____ day of ________, 2005, and authorized by Ordinance 121928, for purposes of providing for the acquisition of properties over which the CLC will not acquire a conservation easement, authorizing the parties to enter into property-specific conservation-stewardship agreements over such properties, and adding parcels to the priority properties list, Exhibit A to the Agreement.

 Recitals

 A.As a party to the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation

 A. As a party to the Cedar River Habitat Conservation Plan, dated April 21, 2000, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time ("HCP"), the City has made a commitment to contribute specified amounts of money to acquire, restore, enhance and/or protect high quality spawning, rearing or refuge habitat for anadromous fish species, and the natural features and processes sustaining such habitat, along the mainstem of the lower Cedar River below Landsburg Dam ("Fish Habitat") until the expiration of the HCP on December 31, 2050.

 B. In order to fulfill its HCP habitat commitments, the City entered into the Agreement with the CLC for the acquisition and management of suitable fish habitat. This Agreement provides for the CLC to hold and purchase conservation-stewardship easements to properties the City acquires through the process established by the Agreement and provides further for the CLC to enter separate property-specific enhancement and/or restoration agreements with the City for acquired properties.

 C. Because it is not always desirable for the City to convey or for the CLC to hold or purchase conservation-stewardship easements to acquired properties (e.g., because funding sources may not allow it), the Parties agree that it is to their mutual advantage to amend the Agreement to provide for the acquisition of properties without CLC holding or purchasing conservation-stewardship easements to such properties and, instead, authorizing the Parties to enter into separate property-specific conservation-stewardship agreements, providing for CLC's management and preservation of fish habitat on acquired properties.

 D. The City and CLC have also identified additional priority parcels for potential acquisition and the Parties agree that these priority parcels should be added to Exhibit A to the Agreement.

 Now, therefore, in consideration of the recognized mutual advantages contained herein, the Parties agree to amend the Agreement as follows:

 Amendment

 1. Subsection 2(C) of the Agreement is amended by inserting the following at the end of the subsection:

 "In some instances and notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 5(A), the Parties may determine that the conveyance of a conservation easement to the CLC is not desirable and the Parties may in such cases enter into a separate property-specific conservation-stewardship agreement for an Acquired Property that provides for CLC's management and preservation of Fish Habitat on the Acquired Property."

 2. Exhibit A to the Agreement, Potential Property Acquisitions, is amended by adding the following additional parcels to the list:
