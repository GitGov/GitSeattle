 REAL ESTATE DONATION AGREEMENT

 This Real Estate Donation Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the Effective Date (defined below) between the CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Donee") and BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY ("BNSF"). This Agreement shall not be binding upon either party unless and until both parties have executed and delivered this Agreement. The submission of this document by BNSF to Donee shall not constitute an offer to sell, donate or transfer by BNSF.

 In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, BNSF and Donee agree as follows:

 GENERAL TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

 1. The following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

 Closing. The consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, which shall be deemed to have occurred when both parties have delivered the items contemplated in Section 4 of this Agreement.

 Closing Date The date selected by BNSF in a written notice to Donee which date shall be no later than forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date and no earlier than five (5) business days after such notice to Donee; provided, however, that BNSF may subsequently extend the Closing Date to a date no later than________________, 2007 by written notice to Donee.

 Review Period The period commencing on the Effective Date and expiring at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time on the date that is thirty (30) days after the Effective Date.

 DONATION

 2. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, BNSF agrees to quitclaim to Donee, and Donee agrees to accept from BNSF, all of BNSF's right, title and interest (if any), in and to the Property.

 INSPECTION

 3. (a) BNSF will prepare a legal description of the Property and will forward such description to Donee for Donee's review. Donee shall have ten (10) days following such delivery to notify BNSF in writing if Donee objects to such description. If Donee does not so object, then the description of the Property prepared by BNSF shall be the definition of the Property for all purposes under this Agreement. If Donee does so object, then Donee shall cause to be prepared a survey of the Property certified to BNSF, Donee and such other parties as Donee may choose showing the boundaries of the Property and any improvements located thereon (the "Survey"). If BNSF does not agree that the description of the Property contained on the Survey is the Property BNSF wishes to sell or otherwise objects to the Survey then BNSF may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Donee and neither party shall have any further obligation hereunder except those that expressly survive termination. If BNSF agrees in writing that the Survey description is accurate, then the description thereon shall be the definition of the Property for all purposes under this Agreement. In the event a city, county, or other governing authority where the Property is located (a "Municipality") requires a survey, plat or lot boundary adjustment to convey the Property (a "Plat"), the Donee shall obtain, at Donee's sole cost and expense, such Plat and the approval of such Municipality. BNSF shall execute all documents reasonably necessary for the Donee to obtain such Plat. BNSF's obligations hereunder are conditioned upon BNSF's approval of the Plat approved by the Municipality. Donee shall provide the proposed Plat to BNSF prior to submission to the Municipality and prior to the expiration of the Review Period.

 (b) Donee shall have until the end of the Review Period to examine title to the Property. If Donee elects to obtain a title commitment for the Property Donee may deliver to BNSF no later than the expiration of the Review Period written notice of any objections to the status of title or matters reflected on the Survey that Donee may have together with a copy of such title commitment, Survey and all matters referenced therein. BNSF shall have no obligation to cure any such objection. If BNSF notifies Donee in writing that BNSF will cure any such objection BNSF (a) shall make good faith efforts to cure such matter by the Closing Date and if not cured by such date Donee may terminate this Agreement and neither party shall have any further obligation hereunder except those that expressly survive termination, and (b) may effect such cure by causing the title company issuing the title commitment to remove such matter as an exception from coverage by paying additional premium therefor or otherwise. If BNSF at any time notifies Donee in writing that BNSF is not willing or able to cure any of the such objections (including those which BNSF has previously endeavored to cure) then Donee or BNSF may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other delivered within five (5) business days after BNSF so notifies Donee that BNSF is unwilling or unable to cure such objection. In the event of such termination neither party shall have any further obligation hereunder except those that expressly survive termination. If this Agreement is not so terminated, the parties shall proceed to Closing according to the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 (c) Prior to any entry upon the Property by Donee, Donee shall execute and deliver to BNSF an Entry and Confidentiality Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein (the "Entry Agreement"). The terms and provisions of the Entry Agreement are incorporated herein, shall survive the Closing, shall not be merged into the Deed or any document delivered at Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Any breach by Donee of its obligations under the Entry Agreement shall be deemed a breach by Donee under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the provisions of Section 6(a), nothing in this Agreement or the exercise of any remedy by BNSF under this Agreement shall limit or affect in any manner any remedy available to BNSF under the Entry Agreement in the event of a breach of Donee's obligations under the Entry Agreement.

 (d) Donee shall have until the end of the Review Period to determine if the Property is suitable for Donee's purposes including, but not limited to, the status of zoning, physical characteristics and conditions of the Property, and compliance with applicable laws. If Donee determines that the Property is not suitable for Donee's purposes or if Donee for any reason or no reason wishes to terminate this Agreement, Donee may terminate this Agreement by written notice to BNSF received no later than the expiration of the Review Period. If Donee does so terminate this Agreement neither party shall have any further obligation hereunder except those that expressly survive termination. If Donee does not so terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the Review Period, the parties shall proceed to Closing according to the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Promptly upon BNSF's written request, Donee shall deliver a copy of any written inspection report, survey or test result received by Donee. If any of such items reveal any adverse conditions, BNSF may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Donee in which case neither party shall have any further obligation hereunder except those that expressly survive termination.

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 3(b), Donee shall not be entitled to object to any judgment against BNSF which may appear of record as a lien against the Property. BNSF shall pay such lien if and when it is judicially determined to be valid, and BNSF hereby indemnifies the Donee for all loss arising out of BNSF's failure to have a judgment lien so settled and satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 3(b), Donee shall not be entitled to object to the lien of any of BNSF's mortgages. BNSF shall deliver to Donee, who shall place of record, good and sufficient releases of the liens of any mortgages on the Property securing indebtedness to which BNSF is obligated to pay within one hundred eighty (180) days after the first meeting of BNSF's Board of Directors held after the Closing. In the event BNSF shall be unable to obtain said releases for any reason, Donee may proceed to condemn any such lienhold interest, and BNSF shall be responsible for all the Donee's costs (including attorney's fees) associated with any such condemnation.

 4. Maintenance and operations records for the Station, including any bills or invoices for operations or maintenance in the last 5 years.

 5. Any unresolved claims, lawsuits, agency actions involving the Station.

 BNSF shall make any of the above records that it finds in its possession available to Donee for inspection and copying. Donee acknowledges and agrees that any such documents and reports that BNSF may discover have been provided for Donee's convenience, that BNSF does not make any representation or warranty concerning the accuracy or completeness of such documents, and that BNSF does not warrant that it has discovered every document in its possession that may meet Donee's request.

 (g) BNSF shall remove all furniture, equipment, records, carpeting and other personal property from the second and third floors of the Property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date.

 PRORATIONS AND CLOSING COSTS

 5. (a) Real estate taxes and assessments payable or paid in the year of Closing shall be prorated by BNSF and Donee as of the Closing Date on the basis of the most recent ascertainable taxes assessed against the Property. If the Property is not separately assessed for tax purposes then there shall be no proration of taxes between Donee and BNSF, the parties shall cooperate post-Closing to cause the Property to be separately assessed and each party shall indemnify the other for any failure to pay real estate taxes and assessments due with respect to the properties constituting the tax parcel to which the Property is a part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no proration for taxes to the extent the payment of same has been assumed by a tenant under an existing lease to be assigned to Donee. BNSF shall be responsible for all outstanding assessments on the Property levied or due to the date of Closing and afterward shall be paid by Donee.

 (b) The parties shall cooperate so that utilities serving the Property that are not the responsibility of a tenant under a lease to be assigned to Donee at Closing, to the extent feasible, shall be switched into the name of Donee as of the Closing Date, so that a final statement can be issued to BNSF for the billing period ending on the Closing Date, and so that the first day of the first billing cycle in Donee's name can begin on the Closing Date. If, however, the final statement covering the final period of ownership by BNSF also includes periods of ownership by Donee, Donee shall pay BNSF at Closing the amount attributable to Donee's period of ownership. Donee shall be responsible to pay all utilities serving the Property due after Closing.

 (c) Donee shall pay all closing costs associated with Closing including, but not limited to, any escrow fees, documentary stamps and other recording costs associated with this transaction, excise taxes, the cost of any state, county or local transfer taxes, the cost of the Survey, and the costs associated with any title insurance obtained by Donee.

 (d) BNSF represents to the Donee that it has not entered into an agreement with any person for the sale of the Property which would entitle such person to a commission or other compensation for the sale of the Property. If any real estate broker or agent can establish a valid claim for commission or other compensation as a result of Donee having used their services in connection with the purchase of the Property, all such commission or other compensation shall be paid by Donee. BNSF shall not be liable for any real estate commissions or finders fees to any party with respect to the sale of the Property, except amounts due to Staubach_Global Services - RR Inc._ ("Broker") pursuant to a separate agreement. Donee acknowledges that Broker has advised and hereby advises Donee that the Broker is acting on behalf of the BNSF, with the duty to represent BNSF's interest, and Broker is not the agent of the Donee. If a policy of title insurance is to be obtained, Donee should obtain a commitment for title insurance which should be examined prior to closing by an attorney of Donee's choice. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Broker has advised and hereby advises the principals of this transaction, that this Agreement is binding on them, and the principals hereby acknowledge that they have been so advised. Broker has no authority to execute any document on behalf of BNSF, make representations on behalf of BNSF or bind BNSF in any manner.

 (e) The obligations of the parties in this Section 5, to the extent incurred, shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 6. (a) In the event of a default by Donee under the terms of this Agreement, BNSF's sole and exclusive remedies shall be: (a) terminate this Agreement whereupon the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder except those that expressly survive termination, or (b) waive such default and proceed Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall waive or diminish any right or remedy BNSF may have at law or in equity for Donee's default or breach of any obligation hereunder to be performed by Donee after Closing.

 (b) In the event of a default by BNSF under the terms of this Agreement, Donee's sole and exclusive remedies hereunder shall be to terminate this Agreement and receive an amount from BNSF not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars equal to the out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Donee in connection with this Agreement as evidenced by copies of third party invoices delivered to BNSF. Upon such termination and the payment of such sums by BNSF the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder except those that expressly survive termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall waive or diminish any right or remedy Donee may have at law or in equity for BNSF's default or breach of any obligation hereunder to be performed by BNSF after Closing. Nothing contained herein shall limit any right Donee might otherwise have to condemn the Property.

 RESERVATIONS

 8. The obligations in this Section 8 shall be binding upon Donee and its heirs, successors and assigns, shall be included in the Deed and shall be covenants running with the land benefiting BNSF and BNSF's successors and assigns. Donee may object to the reservations set forth in Section 8(a) below in accordance with the provision of Section 3 and if BNSF is unwilling or unable to cure such objection either party may terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 3.

 (a) Donee's interest in the Property is subject to the rights of National Passenger Railroad Corporation ("Amtrak") in and to the Property pursuant to (i) the Rail Passenger Service Act (49 U.S.C. 24309 et seq.) as amended, and (ii) the agreement between Amtrak and the predecessors in interest of BNSF dated September 1, 1996 concerning, in part, the provision of BNSF facilities to Amtrak. Donee shall provide Amtrak with operating capacity within the Property on conditions and terms that will satisfy and be entirely consistent with all of BNSF's obligations to Amtrak in such regard. Occupancy and/or uses by Amtrak may include the right of Amtrak to contract for limited food services within the Property incidental to its operations. It is the intent of the parties that Amtrak's rights with respect to the Property will not, in any way, be changed due to the donation of the Property by BNSF to Donee.

 (b) Donee's interest shall be subject to the rights and interests of all third parties in and to the Property including, but not limited to, all existing driveways, roads, utilities, fiber optic lines, tracks, wires and easements of any kind whatsoever on the Property and whether or not of public record. Donee and BNSF acknowledge and agree that any revenue that may accrue to BNSF from such interest holders is de minimis.

 (c) BNSF shall have a perpetual easement on the Property for the use of any presently existing or future driveways, roads, or access ways located on the Property for purposes of vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress to and from BNSF's right of way for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, operating or repairing such right of way. It is understood and agreed by BNSF and Donee that such use does not unduly burden Donee's intended use of the Property.

 (d) Any improvements constructed or altered on the Property after the date BNSF quitclaims its interest to Donee shall be constructed or altered in such a manner to provide adequate drainage of water away from any of BNSF's railroad tracks on nearby property.

 (e) Donee acknowledges and affirms that BNSF may not hold fee simple title to the Property, that BNSF's interest in the Property, if any, may rise only to the level of an easement for railroad purposes. Donee is willing to accept BNSF's title to the Property, if any, on this basis and expressly releases BNSF, its successors and assigns from any claims that Donee or its successors may have as a result of an abandonment of the line of rail running over or adjacent to the Property. In light of BNSF's disclosure that it may not hold a fee interest in the Property, Donee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold BNSF harmless from any suit or claim for damages, punitive or otherwise, expenses, attorneys' fees, or civil penalties that may be imposed on BNSF as the result of any person or entity claiming an interest in the Property or claiming that BNSF did not have the right to transfer the Property to Donee.

Donee represents and warrants to BNSF that if Donee is other than a natural person or persons that it is a validly formed city under the laws of the State of Washington; that it is in good standing in the state of its organization and in the state in which the Property is located; that it has all requisite authorizations to enter into this Agreement; and that the parties executing this Agreement on behalf of Donee are duly authorized to so do.

 WHEREAS, Permittee as Donee and Railroad as BNSF have entered into that certain Real Estate Donation Agreement (the "Donation Agreement") dated as of [Insert Effective Date of Purchase and Sale Agreement] concerning the property(ies) set forth therein (the "Property"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Donation Agreement.

 WHEREAS, in order to evaluate the acquisition of the Property, Permittee has requested access to the Property to inspect the condition of the Property.

 WHEREAS, Railroad is willing to permit such access only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which are incorporated herein, the mutual covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree to the following:

 1. RIGHT OF ENTRY. In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, Railroad hereby grants Permittee a non-exclusive, revocable license, subject to all rights, interests, and estates of third parties including, without limitation, any leases, licenses, easements, liens, or other encumbrances, to enter the Property for the purpose of inspecting the Property for said potential acquisition and for no other purpose or use.

 2. RESTRICTIONS CONCERNING ENTRY.

 (a) Permittee shall enter the Property only during normal business hours and may inspect the condition thereof and conduct such surveys and to make such engineering and other inspections, tests and studies as Permittee shall determine to be reasonably necessary, all at Permittee's sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Permittee shall not conduct or allow any physically intrusive testing of, on or under the Property and under no circumstances shall Permittee be permitted to conduct any tests, investigations or any other activity using mechanized equipment and/or machinery, or place or store any mechanized equipment, tools or other materials, within twenty-five (25) feet of the centerline of any railroad track on the Property unless Permittee has obtained prior written approval from Railroad, which approval may be withheld in Railroad's sole discretion.

 (b) Permittee agrees to give Railroad notice at least five (5) business days prior to any such entry, examinations or surveys and Railroad has the right to be present during any such entry, examination or survey. Such notice shall be made to Railroad's Roadmaster at [fill in address and phone # of Roadmaster] . Permittee agrees to conduct all examinations and surveys of the Property in a manner that will not interfere with the operations or improvements of Railroad or other lessees, Permittees or license holders and in such a manner and not at any time to be a source of danger to or interference with the existence or use of present of future tracks, roadbed or property of Railroad, or the safe operation and activities of Railroad.

 (c) Permittee shall comply with, and cause its agents to comply with, any and all laws, statutes, regulations, ordinances, rules, orders, common law, covenants or restrictions ("Legal Requirements") applicable to the Property and their activities thereon and any and all safety requirements of Railroad and if ordered to cease any activities upon the Property by Railroad's personnel Permittee shall immediately do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing right of Railroad, the parties agree that Railroad has no duty or obligation to monitor Permittee's activities on the Property to determine the safe nature thereof, it being solely the Permittee's responsibility to ensure that Permittee's activities on the Property are safe. Neither the exercise nor failure by Railroad to exercise any rights granted in this Section will alter the liability allocation provided by this Agreement.

 (d) Permittee shall not harm or damage the Property or cause any claim adverse to Railroad.

 (e) Permittee shall promptly reimburse Railroad for any additional costs/expenses incurred by Railroad in connection with such safety requirements (including, but not limited to, furnishing a flagman if Railroad determines that furnishing a flagman is necessary during any such examinations or surveys).

 (f) Permittee will not have more than 5 persons present on any individual Property at one time. Any officer, employee, agent, contractor, consultant, lender, surveyor or attorney entering the Property on behalf of or at the direction of Permittee, shall be deemed agents of Permittee for purposes of this Agreement.

 3. TERM. This Agreement shall commence on the date Railroad executes this Agreement as indicated below its signature (the "Effective Date") and shall be in effect until the earlier of the date the Donation Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, or the Closing Date. No expiration or termination of this Agreement shall release either party from any liability or obligation under this Agreement, whether of indemnity or otherwise, resulting from any acts, omissions or events occurring prior to the date of termination or expiration.

 4. INSURANCE. Donee shall provide BNSF with evidence in a form reasonable satisfactory to BNSF of Donee's self-insured status.

 5. COMPLETION OF INSPECTION. Upon completion of any inspection by Permittee or its agents on the Property or upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, whichever shall occur first, Permittee shall, at its sole cost and expense:

 (b) report any damage to the Property arising from, growing out of, or connected with Permittee's entry upon the Property and restore the Property to its condition immediately prior to such entry by Permittee or its agents;

 (c) remedy any unsafe conditions on the Property created by Permittee or its agents; and

 6. INDEMNITY.

 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PERMITTEE SHALL INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS RAILROAD AND RAILROAD'S AFFILIATED COMPANIES, PARTNERS, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, "INDEMNITEES") FOR, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, FINES, PENALTIES, COSTS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIENS, CAUSES OF ACTION, SUITS DEMANDS, JUDGMENTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COURT COSTS, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS OF INVESTIGATION) (COLLECTIVELY "LIABILITIES") OF ANY NATURE, KIND OR DESCRIPTION OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, RESULTING FROM OR RELATED TO (IN WHOLE OR IN PART):

 (a) ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY PERMITTEE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERMITTEE'S OBLIGATION TO COMPLY AND CAUSE ITS AGENTS TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND CERCLA,

 (b) ANY RIGHTS OR INTERESTS GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT,

 (c) PERMITTEE'S OR ITS AGENTS ACTIVITIES UPON OR USE OF ANY OF THE PROPERTY, OR

 (d) ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF PERMITTEE OR PERMITTEE'S AGENTS OR ANYONE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY ANY OF THEM, OR ANYONE THEY CONTROL OR EXERCISE CONTROL OVER,

 EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE FROM OR ARE ATTRIBUTED TO, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, ANY NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNITEE. THE ONLY LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH PERMITTEE'S OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY THE INDEMNITEES DOES NOT APPLY ARE LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT PROXIMATELY CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF AN INDEMNITEE.

 7. CONFIDENTIALITY. Except to the extent otherwise required by Legal Requirements, Permittee shall not disclose to any third parties any information Permittee discovers or obtains concerning the Property as a result of any inspections, surveys, tests or other activities conducted with respect to the Property ("Confidential Information") including, but not limited to, any oral, electronic or written information provided by Railroad or on Railroad's behalf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Donee may disclose Confidential Information to those of Donee's agents directly involved with Permittee with respect to the acquisition of the Property, provided such individuals and firms have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement and provided further that Permittee shall be liable hereunder for any breach by such parties of such obligation. Confidential Information shall not include information that is or becomes in the public domain other than as a result of a breach by Permittee or its agents. If Permittee or any of it's agents receive a request to disclose any part of the Confidential Information, Permittee shall (a) notify Railroad immediately of the existence, terms and circumstances of such request, (b) consult with Railroad on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such requests, and (c) if disclosure of such Confidential Information is required to prevent Permittee being held in contempt or subject to other penalty, shall (i) furnish only such information as is legally required to be so disclosed, and (ii) use its best efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to the disclosed Confidential Information. If the transaction contemplated in the Donation Agreement does not close for any reason then Permittee, to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements, shall, promptly upon Railroad's request, forward to Railroad all Confidential Information without keeping any copies thereof.

 8. DEFAULT. Permittee acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, Railroad would be irreparably harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law, in equity or under this Agreement, Railroad shall be entitled to injunctive relief (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) to prevent such breach and/or to compel specific performance. Permittee and its agents shall not oppose the granting of such relief. In the event of any breach by Permittee or its agents under this Agreement, Railroad may terminate this Agreement and shall be entitled to any other remedy available at law, in equity or under this Agreement. No failure or delay of either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such party's right to require strict compliance with any term of this Agreement.

 9. GOVERNING LAW, JURY WAIVER. All questions concerning the interpretation or application of provisions of this Agreement shall be decided according to the laws of the State of Washington without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Any action relating to this Agreement may be brought in the courts of King County, Washington. PERMITTEE AND RAILROAD IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUITE OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH, OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT.

 10. DONATION AGREEMENT. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed incorporated into the Donation Agreement, shall survive the closing thereunder and shall not be merged into the deed conveying the Property or any other closing document, provided, however that nothing in the Donation Agreement shall limit or modify any remedy available to Railroad under this Agreement for a breach by Permittee of its obligations under this Agreement. All notices hereunder shall be delivered in the manner set forth in the Donation Agreement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed as of the Effective Date.

GRANTEE shall provide Amtrak with operating capacity within the Property on conditions and terms that will satisfy and be entirely consistent with all of GRANTOR's obligations to Amtrak in such regard. Occupancy and/or uses by Amtrak may include the right of Amtrak to contract for limited food services within the Property incidental to its operations.

 7.5 GRANTEE acknowledges and affirms that GRANTOR may not hold fee simple title to the Property, that GRANTOR's interest in the Property, if any, may rise only to the level of an easement for railroad purposes. GRANTEE is willing to accept GRANTOR's title to the Property, if any, on this basis and expressly releases GRANTOR, its successors and assigns from any claims that GRANTEE or its successors may have as a result of an abandonment of the line of rail running over or adjacent to the Property. In light of GRANTOR's disclosure that it may not hold a fee interest in the Property, GRANTEE agrees to indemnify, defend and hold GRANTOR harmless from any suit or claim for damages, punitive or otherwise, expenses, attorneys' fees, or civil penalties that may be imposed on GRANTOR as the result of any person or entity claiming an interest in the Property or claiming that GRANTOR did not have the right to transfer the Property to GRANTEE.
