 AN ORDINANCE authorizing Seattle Public Utilities to acquire by negotiation or condemnation of land and all improvements thereon properties generally bounded on the south by S. Kenyon St, on the west by SR 509, on the north by S. Holden St, and on the east by SR 99, for solid waste system, other utility and general municipal purposes.

 WHEREAS, the 2003 draft Solid Waste Facilities Master Plan (SWFMP), developed pursuant to Resolution 30431, generally concluded that the City's existing solid waste facilities are inadequate to deliver cost-effective and environmentally beneficial solid waste reuse, recycling, collection and disposal services; and

 WHEREAS, based on findings in the SWFMP that the City's South Recycling and Disposal Station ("SRDS") has a number of serious service constraints, including frequent lines of motor vehicles extending onto the public roadway, significant customer delays and insufficient space to improve recycling and reuse facilities, the SWFMP recommended acquisition of approximately four acres of adjacent property in order to address those service problems and for other solid waste system uses; and

 WHEREAS, acquisition of the adjacent property is also consistent with the amended Solid Waste Plan, adopted by Resolution 30750 in March 2005; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.152 and RCW 8.12.030 authorize the City to purchase or condemn property for solid waste, other utility or general municipal purposes; and
