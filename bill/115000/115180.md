 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed a Contract for Sale of Real Estate ("Agreement") with the Central Area Development Association (CADA), a Washington nonprofit corporation ("CADA") based on the form attached as Attachment A, with such additions, modifications and amendments as the Mayor or OED Director decide are necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, together with such ancillary and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Agreement shall provide for the transfer of the land legally described as:

 Parcel "40" - Lots 1 and 2, except the North 70 feet thereof and except the South 16 feet for alley, in Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington; and

 The South 36 feet of the North 70 feet of Lot 1 and the South 36 feet of the North 70 feet of the West 10 feet of Lot 2, in Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington;

 (the "Property") to CADA, or an assignee permitted by the City, on the terms and subject to the conditions authorized in this ordinance. Consideration for the transfer of the Property shall be SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND and no/100 dollars ($750,000.00). The City Council determines that such amount, payable on the terms authorized herein, is adequate in light of the factors described in RCW 35.81.090. The Agreement shall provide that the Property shall be transferred subject to restrictions of record, and to development and use conditions that the City shall impose as a condition of the sale, which shall include, but not be limited to, substantially those described in Section 3 of this ordinance. The Agreement shall provide for the consideration to be paid by applying the nonrefundable earnest money to be delivered to the City upon signing of the Agreement, and the balance according to the terms of a nonrecourse promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the Property. The promissory note shall be on the terms described in an exhibit to Attachment A, with such modifications and insertions as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance, and shall have a maturity date approximately 15 years from the anticipated date of completion of the improvements on the Property required by the Agreement, provided that the Mayor or OED Director may agree to a later maturity date if necessary to accommodate other financing.

 Section 2. The Agreement shall require that the Property be developed in conformity with the Central Area Action Plan, as recognized by Resolution 28815, and all applicable ordinances. The Agreement shall provide interim deadlines as deemed appropriate by the Mayor or OED Director, which may be extended in the discretion of the Mayor or OED Director, but in any event the Agreement shall terminate if the conditions to transfer of the Property by the City are not satisfied by December 31, 2006, unless that date is extended in the discretion of the Mayor or OED Director to a date no later than July 1, 2007.

 Section 3. The Agreement shall require that the Property be developed with at least 40 residential units, of which at least 51% must be occupied by low- and moderate-income households as defined in 24 C.F.R. Section 570.3 ("LMIHs"), and with at least 8,000 net rentable square feet for neighborhood retail, professional and personal services, restaurants and office space that support development of the 23rd and Jackson business node as described in the Central Area Action Plan (such non-residential improvements are referred to as the "Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center"). The housing and Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center, together with any additional improvements to be developed on the property with the approval of the Mayor or his designee and all necessary regulatory approvals, are referred to in this ordinance as the "Project".

 Section 4. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized to execute, for delivery and recording upon satisfaction of conditions precedent to City's obligation to convey the Property, upon delivery of the promissory note for the deferred portion of the purchase price and the deed of trust securing such note, and upon delivery of such other documents as the Agreement may require at closing, a quit claim deed to the Property subject to the terms of the covenants as described below, and to any other reservations or conditions that the Mayor or his designee shall deem necessary or appropriate. The Agreement shall provide that, as a condition of the transfer and simultaneously with the delivery and recordation of the deed, the purchaser shall execute, deliver and record against the title to the Property, covenants acceptable to the Mayor or his designee committing that 51% of residential units shall be occupied by low- and moderate-income households, and at least 8,000 net rental square feet shall be maintained as a neighborhood commercial/retail center, in each case for a minimum of fifteen (15) years after completion of such improvements, and in any event for so long as any amount is owing to the City on the purchase price or on the Central Area Capital Fund/Community Equity Fund loan, as authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 5. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized to execute, deliver and accept, such additional documents, which may include amendments to the Agreement and related covenants, or replacements or substitutes for documents, and to take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance, and is authorized to administer and enforce the Agreement, covenants, and any other such documents. Pursuant to RCW chapter 35.81, the City Council assigns to the Mayor and the OED Director the community renewal powers described in this ordinance with respect to the Property.

 Section 6. The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City, to lend and cause the disbursement to CADA, pursuant to the Loan Agreement authorized in Section 7 of this ordinance, of up to SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($750,000), of funds previously appropriated for the Community Equity Fund component of the Central Area Capital Fund Program ("Equity Fund"), which program was authorized in Ordinance 117729, as amended by Ordinance 119224. Such loan funds shall be used to finance the earnest money payment to the City required by the Agreement and other costs related to the proposed acquisition and redevelopment of the Property, including predevelopment costs. The loan shall be payable on the terms set forth in the form of promissory note attached as Attachment B to this ordinance, with such insertions and modifications as the Mayor or OED Director may determine are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance, and except that the Loan Agreement may provide that if the Agreement shall terminate without the Property having been conveyed to the purchaser, under circumstances in which the earnest money is retained by the City and there is no liability of either party, then an amount of the loan up to $450,500 may be forgiven. The maturity date of the loan shall be approximately 15 years from the anticipated date of completion of the improvements on the Property required by the Agreement, provided that the Mayor or OED Director may agree to a later maturity date if necessary to accommodate other financing. At any time prior to the maturity date and upon written request of CADA, up to $300,000 of the loan amount may be forgiven provided that the principal amount has not previously become due; the redevelopment of the Property has been timely completed; at least 51% of residential units have been occupied by low- and moderate-income households, at least 8,000 net rental square feet have been maintained as a neighborhood commercial/retail center; CADA, or an entity in which CADA has a direct interest, remains the legal and equitable owner of the Property; and CADA remains in compliance with the terms of the Agreement and all other agreements with the City regarding the property. To the extent the loan terms and conditions described in this ordinance and in Attachment B hereto differ from those set forth in the policies for the Central Area Capital Fund adopted in Ordinance 117729, as amended by Ordinance 119224, the terms and conditions of this ordinance and Attachment B shall govern.

 Section 7. The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed (1) a Loan Agreement with CADA, based on the loan terms authorized in this ordinance, with such additions and modifications the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance ("Loan Agreement"); and (2) such amendments and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Equity Fund loan shall be initially secured by a security assignment of the Agreement, and after closing of the sale of the Property, shall be secured by a deed of trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED director, against the Property. Such deed of trust, and the deed of trust securing the deferred purchase price of the Property, which may be the same instrument, may be subordinated, consistent with Central Area Capital Fund policies adopted in Ordinance 117729, as amended by Ordinance 119224, and in the discretion of the Mayor or OED Director, to one or more other mortgages or deeds of trust securing one or more construction loans for development of the Project and for retirement of the Promissory Notes, as described in Section 1 of this ordinance, and to one or more deeds of trust securing permanent loans used to retire such construction loans.

 Section 8. The Loan Agreement shall provide, consistent with HUD regulations, that CADA shall take affirmative steps to assure that minority and women's business enterprises are used when possible, that CADA shall maintain records of those steps, and that nothing in the Loan Agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to applicable law.

 Section 9. Earnest money received under the Agreement, proceeds of the sale of the Property, and interest received by the City on deferred sales proceeds shall be deposited in the Urban Renewal Closeout Subaccount of the HUD Special Purpose Grants Subfund of the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. Payments of principal and interest on the loan authorized in this ordinance shall be deposited in the UDAG Fund (17830). To the extent that amounts received as described in this section are deposited in such funds, the appropriations for the following in the 2005 Budget are increased from the funds shown, as follows

 Fund Department Budget Control Amount Level

 HUD Special Office of Economic 6XD20 $450,500.00 Purpose Grants Development (17820)

 Funds so appropriated shall be received and expended for purposes authorized by this ordinance and for the Community Equity Fund activity of the Central Area Capital Fund as authorized in Ordinance 119224. Unexpended and unencumbered balances of the appropriations in this Section shall carry forward from year to year until expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 10. The OED Director is authorized to cause the City to make payment to the holder of the lien on the Property, in the original principal amount of $425,000.00, plus accrued interest, sufficient to discharge such lien in full.

 Section 11. The Mayor and OED Director are authorized to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement the purposes of this ordinance.

 Upon execution of this Contract, Purchaser shall pay to the City a nonrefundable earnest money payment ("Earnest Money") in the amount of FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND no/100 DOLLARS ($450,500.00). If the Purchaser satisfies in a timely manner all conditions to the Seller's obligation to convey the Real Estate, and the Purchaser fully performs its obligations hereunder in a timely manner, then the Earnest Money shall apply to the Purchase Price on Closing. Purchaser shall not be entitled to interest on the Earnest Money.

 Purchaser is borrowing from Seller the full amount of the Earnest Money payment as part of a loan pursuant to a Loan Agreement between Seller as Lender and Purchaser as Borrower, dated as of ______________, 2005 ("Equity Fund Loan"). The Equity Fund Loan is evidenced by Purchaser's promissory note payable to the order of Seller in the stated principal amount of $750,000.00 ("Equity Fund Note").

 Article 2. Purchase Price and Purchase Money Mortgage; Subordination

 2.01 Purchase Price; Purchase Money Note.

Purchaser shall deliver at closing a promissory note, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Purchase Money Note"), in the amount of TWO HUNDRED NINETY-NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND no/100 DOLLARS ($299,500.00). The balance of the Purchase Price shall be due in cash at Closing, but the Earnest Money payment to Seller shall be credited to the cash portion of the Purchase Price.

 2.02 Purchase Money Documents.

 The "Purchase Money Documents" are the Purchase Money Note, the Purchase Money Mortgage, any additional documents granted or delivered as security for the Purchase Money Note.

 2.03 Purchase Money Mortgage.

 (a) The Purchase Money Note shall be initially secured by a Security Assignment of this Contract, in form and content acceptable to Seller, and after Closing by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing on the Real Estate granted by Purchaser, in form and content acceptable to Seller ("Purchase Money Mortgage"). At the Seller's option, the deed of trust on the Real Estate granted by Purchaser to secure the Equity Fund Note, may be combined with the Purchase Money Mortgage, may be senior to the Purchase Money Mortgage, or may be junior to the Purchase Money Mortgage. The parties acknowledge that to complete the financing for the Project, the Purchaser intends to convey the Real Estate to a limited liability company controlled by Purchaser ("Company"), and that Purchaser would receive upon such transfer a promissory note from the Company secured by a deed of trust on the Real Estate. If

 (1) the terms of such note and deed of trust are acceptable to the Seller;

 (2) the Purchaser is otherwise in full compliance with the terms of this Contract;

 (3) the terms of any agreements related to the transfer provide assurance deemed adequate by the Mayor or OED Director that the Purchaser, or a successor entity approved by the City, will have the right to reacquire title to the Real Estate on terms that will not require significant public funds, and that in the event the Purchaser should cease to be the manager of the Company, any successor manager would be a nonprofit or public entity approved by the City;

 (4) all relevant documents shall have been submitted to the Seller at least 30 days in advance; and

 (5) the Seller receives such title insurance or endorsements thereto as the Seller may require,

 then the Seller shall permit the conveyance of the Real Estate to the Company. Such conveyance may, to the extent deemed necessary by the OED Director, be conditioned upon the execution by Purchaser, delivery and recording of an assignment for security purposes, in form and content acceptable to the Seller, with respect to the note and deed of trust from the Company, and the delivery of such note to the Seller duly indorsed by the Purchaser. Such note and deed of trust in favor of the Purchaser shall have priority over any other obligations of the Company in favor of the Purchaser, and security therefor, except as may be otherwise approved by the Seller, but shall be subordinate to the Deed of Trust and to any liens to which the Deed of Trust is subordinated. The option or other agreement provided to satisfy clause (3) above must contain provisions satisfactory to the Seller permitting assignment and providing the Seller with rights of notice and opportunity to cure before any loss or termination of such option or other rights by reason of default, failure to exercise, failure to satisfy conditions, or otherwise. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to permit such conveyance, Seller shall subordinate the lien of the Deed of Trust to the liens and covenants reasonably required for the Company's financing of the development of the Real Estate as contemplated in this Contract, with the sole exception of liens in favor of Purchaser, provided that such financing and the use of proceeds thereof are on terms acceptable to the City and the form of subordination agreement is acceptable to the City. Borrower shall provide any loan commitment to the City as soon as it is issued by the lender and shall provide the proposed loan documents and form of subordination agreement to the City at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the proposed date of closing of the loan.

 (b) Any obligation of the Seller to grant any subordination hereunder is conditioned upon the delivery to Seller, at least 10 days in advance of the date when Purchaser desires a subordination agreement to be delivered, of the proposed form of subordination agreement and all documents related to the liens or encumbrances to which subordination is requested, as well as documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Seller that the conditions to subordination are satisfied or will be satisfied as of the date of delivery and recording of the subordination agreement. In addition, any subordination may be conditioned upon such changes to the form of subordination agreement as the Seller may require, and the issuance to the Seller of one or more endorsements to the Seller's title insurance policy, as the Seller may require.

 PROMISSORY NOTE

 (Secured)

 $299,500.00 Seattle, Washington Date: , 2005

 1) Promise to Pay. For value received, the CENTRAL AREA DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION, a Washington non-profit corporation (hereinafter referred to as "Maker"), promises to pay in lawful money of the United States of America, to the order of THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City" or "Lender"), a Washington municipal corporation, at Office of Economic Development, 700 Fifth Avenue, Suite 5752, P.O. Box 94708, Seattle, Washington 98124-4708, or such other place as the holder of this Note may designate in writing from time to time, the principal sum of TWO HUNDRED NINETY-NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED and no/100 Dollars and no cents ($299,500.00), as set forth herein.

 2) Contract for Sale; Covenant; Equity Fund Loan Agreement. This Note is made pursuant to a Contract for Sale of Real Estate dated as of ________________, 2005 between the Maker and the named payee ("Contract"), to evidence the unpaid purchase price of certain real property generally located at 17th Avenue South and South Jackson Street in Seattle, Washington ("Property"). Pursuant to the Contract the Maker has executed a Covenant dated as of the date hereof recorded against such property ("Covenant"). The obligation evidenced by this Note is in addition to the obligations of the Maker pursuant to a Loan Agreement between Maker and the named payee dated as of _______________, 2005 for a loan in the principal amount of up to $750,000.00 ("Equity Fund Loan Agreement") and the promissory note made on the same date in such principal amount by Maker to the order of payee ("Equity Fund Note"). Capitalized terms used in this Note and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Contract unless the context clearly otherwise requires, and if not defined in the Contract such terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Equity Fund Loan Agreement unless the context clearly otherwise requires.

 3) Maturity. The principal amount of this Note, and all other amounts owing hereunder, unless earlier accelerated under the terms of this Note or any documents securing this Note, are due and payable the earlier of: (a) ____________ ("Maturity Date); (b) at the option of the holder of this Note, upon any earlier sale or other transfer of all or any portion of Maker's interest in the property securing this note, or any further encumbrance of the Property for money borrowed, prior to the Maturity Date.

 4. Annual Payments. Until all principal and interest shall have been paid in full, Maker shall make annual payments on this Note, on or before _____________ and on or before the same date in each year thereafter (each, a "Payment Date"), each in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Cash Flow of the Property (as defined in subsection ____C of the Equity Fund Note), if any, for the preceding calendar year. Maker shall cause the amount of Net Cash Flow for each year to be certified, without reservation except as normally appears in an unqualified auditor's opinion on financial statements, by an independent auditor retained by Maker to audit the annual financial statements of Maker, and reported as part of the financial statements delivered to Lender on or before June 30 of the following year. In the event there is no Net Cash Flow in any year, no annual payment shall be due in the following year. Maker agrees that Maker's failure or inability to obtain a timely auditor's certification of the amount of Net Cash Flow in any year shall not excuse or defer Maker's obligation to make a payment of the required percentage of the Net Cash Flow for the prior year, and that failure to provide such certification shall be a default. In addition, if by July 31 of any year Maker shall not have delivered an auditor's certification of the amount of Net Cash Flow for the prior calendar year to Lender, then Lender, at its option, without waiving any default or other remedies, may retain an independent accountant to examine the books and records of Maker to make such determination, and the determination of such accountant shall be binding on Maker. Maker shall provide any accountant retained by the Lender under this subsection with full access to Maker's books, records and accounts with third parties, and shall pay all of such accountant's costs and fees upon demand, in addition to all other amounts payable hereunder.

 5) Interest Rate. Maker shall pay interest on the outstanding principal of this Note, at the rate of 5% per annum from the date hereof. After the Maturity Date or after acceleration of the principal balance of this Note in accordance with the terms of this Note or any documents securing this Note, all amounts owing hereunder shall bear interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever shall be less.

 5) Default and Acceleration. Any default under the Contract, the Covenant or the Deed of Trust securing this Note shall constitute a default under this Note, and upon such default the holder of this Note shall have the right, without notice or demand, to declare all amounts owing hereunder immediately due and payable. This Section applies to a default by any successors in interest to the Maker of this Note with respect to any of the Property (as defined in the Covenant), whether or not the Maker shall have caused or permitted such default and whether or not the transfer to such successor shall have been approved or permitted by the holder hereof. In addition, upon or after any event causing the Equity Fund Note to become due and payable in full, the holder of this Note shall have the option to declare all amounts owing on this Note immediately due and payable, without notice or demand.

 6) Prepayment. The principal amount of this Note may be prepaid in full or in part at any time.

 7) Costs and Attorneys' Fees. In case Maker defaults in payment of this Note, Maker agrees to pay all of the holder's costs of collection, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the holder of this Note whether or not suit is instituted.

 Grantee's Covenants, Releases and Indemnity ("Covenant")

 The Property is conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL-FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE GRANTEE'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. Grantee acknowledges that adverse physical, economic or other conditions (including without limitation, adverse environmental soils and ground- water conditions), either latent or patent, may exist on the Property and assumes Grantor's responsibility for all environmental conditions of the Property, known or unknown, including but not limited to responsibility, if any, for investigation, removal or remediation actions relating to the presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance or other environmental contamination relating to the Property. Grantee also releases, covenants not to sue, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Grantor and its past, present and future officials, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties, fees, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to fees and costs of regulatory agencies, attorneys, contractors and consultants), and liabilities arising out of, or in any way connected with, the condition of the Property including but not limited to any alleged or actual past, present or future presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property, or any portion thereof or improvement thereon, from any cause whatsoever; it being intended that Grantee shall so indemnify Grantor and such personnel without regard to any fault or responsibility of Grantor or Grantee. Grantee is aware of the rights it might otherwise have to seek recovery from Grantor for costs of remediation and cleanup of Hazardous Substances under applicable law, including without limitation the Washington Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA") and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and Grantee hereby knowingly waives all such rights, now existing or hereafter arising, and voluntarily relinquishes those rights and forever releases the Grantor from any such obligation. The obligation to complete all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of the Property and the acknowledgements, releases, and covenants herein touch and concern the Property, are intended to run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and assigns.

 For purposes of this Covenant, the term "Hazardous Substance" shall mean petroleum products and compounds containing them; flammable materials; radioactive materials; polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") and compounds containing them; lead, asbestos or asbestos-containing materials in any friable form; underground or above-ground storage tanks; and any substance or material that is now is or hereafter becomes regulated under any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law relating to environmental protection, contamination or cleanup.

 Grantee's release and covenant not to sue shall include both claims by Grantee as original plaintiff against Grantor and any cross-claims, third-party claims or other claims against Grantor by Grantee based upon claims made against Grantee by any third parties. The obligation to indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action costs and natural resources damages claims. This Covenant means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-is, where-is and with-all-faults," and that Grantee assumes all responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any environmental conditions on the Property and has no recourse against Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or liability with respect to the Property. This Covenant shall apply regardless of whether or not Grantee is culpable, negligent or in violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation. Nothing herein shall release, discharge or affect any rights or causes of action that Grantor or Grantee may have against any other person or entity, except as otherwise expressly stated herein, and each of the parties reserves all such rights including, but not limited to, claims for contribution or cost recovery relating to any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property.

 Nondiscrimination. Grantee further covenants that there shall be no discrimination upon the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in the sale, lease or rental, or in the use or occupancy, of the Property or any improvements erected or to be erected thereon. Both the Grantor and the United States of America shall be entitled to enforce this paragraph, which shall run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns.

 The terms of this Covenant are in addition to, and not in substitution for, those terms of the Contract for Sale of Real Property dated ______________, 2005 between Grantor and Grantee (the "Contract") that, by the terms of such Contract, survive the delivery of this deed.

 RELATED DOCUMENTS: N/A

 The covenants herein (collectively, this "Agreement") are made on or as of the ____day of ____________ , 2005, for the benefit of The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, (hereinafter called "City"), by the CENTRAL AREA DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION, a Washington nonprofit corporation (hereinafter called "Owner"), whose address is 2301 South Jackson St., Suite 101-D, Seattle WA 98144. This Agreement is made as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the transfer of land described below to Owner by the City, and is made pursuant to RCW Ch. 35.81, and Seattle Ordinance ____________.

 WHEREAS Owner is the owner of certain real property located at 1700 S. Jackson St., Seattle, WA, legally described as follows (which, including all improvements now or hereafter thereon, is referred to as the "Property"):

 Parcel "40" - Lots 1 and 2, except the North 70 feet thereof and except the South 16 feet for alley, in Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington; and

 and

 Parcel "41" - Lots 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, Block 19, Hill Tract Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 42, records of King County, Washington; and

 WHEREAS the Seattle City Council authorized the transfer of the Property to the Owner, pursuant to a Contract for Sale of Land dated ______________________, 2005 ("Contract") on condition that this Agreement be made and the covenants below be granted by Owner;

 WHEREAS, the Owner has entered into a Loan Agreement with the City dated ________, 2005 ("Equity Fund Loan Agreement") for the loan of up to $750,000.00 to Owner for costs related to the acquisition and development of the Property, and Owner has executed a promissory note payable to the City in the stated principal amount of $750,000.00 to evidence its obligation to repay that loan ("Equity Fund Note");

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the conveyance of the Property, Owner hereby grants, agrees to, and imposes upon the Property the following covenants and restrictions:

 1. Term of Agreement; General Obligation of Owner

 Commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the end of the period set forth in Section 2 below, Owner shall use the Property only to construct, renovate, maintain, and operate buildings consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

 2. Low/Moderate Income Housing.

 (a) Commencing on the date ("Commencement Date") that is the earlier of the "Completion Date" as defined in the Contract or December 31, 2008 and continuing for a period equal to the longer of 15 years from the Commencement Date or the period for which any amount is outstanding on the Equity Fund Note, the Owner shall operate or cause to be operated at least ____ dwelling units on the Property, and in any event no less than 51% of the total dwelling units on the Property, solely as rental housing for low/moderate-income households. Units for low/moderate-income households ("Low-Mod Units") shall be rented for rents affordable to low/moderate-income households. Owner shall maintain or cause to be maintained such units at all times in good condition and repair, and in compliance with all ordinances applicable to units offered for rent or occupied as rental housing.

 (b) For purposes of this Section:

 (i) a "low/moderate-income household" is a household with annual income, at the time of its initial occupancy of a housing unit, at or below the lesser of (A) the maximum limit for a "low- and moderate- income household" under 24 CFR Section 570.3 or successor regulation, or (B) 80% of the median family income for the Seattle-Bellevue- Everett Division of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area (or such other area including Seattle as HUD may use in the future as the basis for income limit determinations for the Seattle area), as published annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and as adjusted for the size of the household in such manner as the Director of the City Office of Economic Development ("Director") shall determine ("adjusted median income"), and

 (ii) a unit is considered "affordable" to a low/moderate-income household if the monthly rent charged for the unit, together with a reasonable allowance for utilities paid by the household, is no greater than one-twelfth of 30% of the maximum annual income for a low/moderate-income household, as adjusted, in such manner as the Director shall determine, for the presumed size of household likely to occupy the unit. For the purpose of determining affordability the presumed household size shall correspond to the size of Unit as set forth below, regardless of the number of persons actually occupying the Unit:

 Unit size Presumed household size Studio or SRO 1 person 1 bedroom 1.5 persons 2 bedrooms 3 persons 33 bedroom 4.5 persons 4 bedrooms 6 persons

 (c) Owner shall report to the City in writing, within 30 days after the Commencement Date, which units, by number and size, are Low-Mod Units. Each Low-Mod Unit shall remain an Low-Mod Unit unless and until (i) the Owner shall have substituted another Unit of at least equal size and quality for such Low-Mod Unit, and shall have rented the substitute unit in accordance with the requirements for a Low-Mod Unit, and (ii) either the Low-Mod Unit for which such other unit is substituted shall have become vacant, or the Owner shall have determined that the household occupying such Low-Mod Unit, as of the latest determination of income and household size, is not a low/moderate income household, in which case that unit shall be considered an "Over-Income Unit." Each substitution shall be reflected on Owner's annual report to the City hereunder. Upon any substitution for an Over-Income Unit, Owner shall promptly notify the tenant of such unit that the unit no longer will be subject to restriction under this Agreement. Owner shall ensure that, unless such a substitution has been made, any Low-Mod Unit that becomes vacant shall be rented to an eligible household. If Owner shall determine that a unit is an Over-Income Unit, then either (1) if possible, Owner shall substitute for the Over-Income Unit a unit that is then not a Low/Mod Unit but is occupied by a low/moderate-income household and is of at least equal in size and quality to the Over- Income Unit, and shall thereafter rent such substitute unit as a Low/Mod Unit, with an immediate reduction in the rent charged if required to make the rent "affordable" hereunder; or (2) if a substitution under clause (1) of this sentence is not possible, then on the first day when at least one unit of at least equal size and quality that is not a Low-Mod Unit is vacant, Owner shall substitute one such vacant unit as a Low-Mod Unit, in place of the Over-Income Unit. If Owner makes a substitution under clause (1) of the previous sentence at a time when more than one unit is eligible to be substituted for the Over-Income Unit under such clause, then Owner shall select the unit occupied by the household with the lowest household income, measured as a percentage of the applicable low/moderate-income limit for the household size. Owner shall affirmatively market units in compliance with all applicable Fair Housing laws and regulations and in such a manner as to make opportunities available to persons from all segments of the community, including without limitation minorities.

 (d) Without limiting the foregoing, during the period specified in subsection 2(a), unless there shall be at least 51% of the total habitable rental units maintained and operated as housing for low/moderate-income households in compliance with this Section, Owner shall not cause or permit any residential unit in the Property to be occupied by anyone other than a low/moderate-income household, nor make any use of the Property for purposes other than as rental housing for low moderate-income households and for the purposes specified in section 3 below.

 (e) Owner shall not, prior to expiration of the period set forth in this Section, cause or permit the demolition or removal of any structure, fixture or improvements on the Property without the express written consent of the Director of Office of Economic Development of the City given expressly for purposes of this Agreement.

 (f) Other that the rent permitted hereunder, Owner shall not require any other fees or payments from residential tenants as a condition to commencing or continuing occupancy in any of the units for low/moderate-income households required by this Agreement, except as may be approved in writing by the City expressly for purposes of this Agreement.

 3. Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center

 (a) Commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing for a period equal to the longer of 15 years from the Commencement Date or the period for which any amount is outstanding on the Equity Fund Note, the Owner shall operate, or cause to be operated, a Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center on the Property comprising at least _____ square feet of net rentable space, as neighborhood retail, professional and personal services, restaurant, and office space that support the development of the Jackson Street corridor business node as described in the Central Area Action Plan, as recognized by City Council in Resolution 28815.

 (b) During the period set forth in this Section Owner shall not cause or permit any use of the Property other than as a Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center consistent with this Section, and as rental housing consistent with Section 2 hereof, unless there shall be in operation a Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center on the Property in compliance with this Section.

 4. Other Uses

 Subject to the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above, the Owner may maintain on the Property other lawful uses, for which all necessary permits and approvals shall have been obtained, that are not incompatible with the residential use required under Section 2 and, so long as Section 3 remains in effect, with the Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center use required under that Section.

 5. Run with the Land; Limits on Transfer; Remedies

 (a) The covenants herein shall run with the Property and be binding on Owner and its successors including any purchaser, grantee, owner or lessee of any portion of the Property and any other person or entity having any right, title or interest therein and on the respective heirs, executors, administrators, devisees, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing, provided that (i) after construction of the improvements on the Property in compliance with the Contract, any lessee or owner of all or part of the residential portion of the Property that does not have any interest in the Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center shall not be obligated for performance of covenants with respect to the Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center; (ii) any tenant occupying a residential unit shall not be obligated except with respect to the restrictions on eligible occupants of that unit; (iii) any lessee of the Neighborhood Commercial/Retail Center shall not be obligated for performance of any covenants except with respect to the portion of the Property leased to that lessee; and (iv) any lessee of any space that is allowed to be devoted to other uses as set forth in Section 4 shall not be obligated for performance of any covenants herein, except those in Section 6 to the extent applicable to the activities of such lessee or to activities in such lessee's space.

 (b) Except for leases or rental agreements with residential tenants, Owner shall not sell, lease or otherwise transfer the Property or any portion thereof or interest therein to anyone unless the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this agreement to the same extent as the transferor, except as limited in subsection 5(a) above, and the City receives a copy of the transferee's agreement prior to the transfer, but the covenants and restrictions herein shall be binding on any such transferee regardless of whether such written agreement is obtained.

 (c) This Agreement may be enforced by The City of Seattle, which shall have all remedies available at law or in equity in case of any breach of the terms hereof. Owner agrees that such remedies may include, without limitation, specific performance, injunctions, appointment of a receiver, and restitution of any unjust enrichment that may accrue to Owner or its successors or assigns from any transfer or use of the Property or any part thereof contrary to the terms hereof. No provision of this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any person other than The City of Seattle.

 6. Compliance with Laws.

 Owner shall at all times maintain the Property in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, and permits. Owner shall not cause or permit any activity on the Property that would constitute a nuisance. Owner shall ensure that any additional uses authorized by Section 4 hereof are maintained and operated in a manner compatible with the uses required by this Agreement.

 7. No Waiver or Termination.

 No waiver or modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and signed by Owner and City. No termination of this Agreement prior to expiration of its term, nor of the obligations in Section 2 or Section 3 during the periods specified in such Sections, shall be valid unless expressly authorized by City Ordinance. No forbearance or delay by the City in enforcement of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver, nor in any way impair the rights or remedies of the City hereunder, and if any waiver shall be granted with respect to any instance of noncompliance with the terms hereof, such waiver shall not affect the right of the City to require compliance will all terms hereof in the future. Any consent of the City required hereunder shall be valid only if given by the Director of the Office of Economic Development or his or her designee expressly for the purposes of this Agreement, and no consent given for purposes of this Agreement shall be construed as a consent, permit, or approval for purposes of any other contract or instrument, nor for purposes of any law, ordinance, regulation or permit.

 8. Governing Law; Venue

 This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington. Owner, for itself and its successors and assigns, consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Washington and to venue of any proceedings brought hereunder in King County, Washington.

 9. Severability

 If any provision of this agreement, or the application thereof to any conditions or circumstances, shall be found to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties intend that the validity or enforceability of the other provisions, or of such provision as applied to other conditions or circumstances, as the case may be, shall not be impaired.

Owner shall make annual certifications to the City that it is in compliance with the housing provisions of this Agreement and shall provide annual audited financial statements for the operation of the housing, including a statement of revenues and expenses for the operation of the housing units and a statement of assets and liabilities of the owner of the housing unit as of the end of the calendar year, in each case certified by an officer of such owner and including the auditor's report.
