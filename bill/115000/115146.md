 Section 2. Substitution of Surety Bond for Cash in Reserve Fund. The City finds that it is in the City's best interest to satisfy the Reserve Fund Requirement for the Outstanding Parity Bonds with a surety bond that constitutes "Qualified Insurance" as that term is defined in the Parity Bond Legislation, rather than with cash. The Director of Finance is authorized and directed, upon his determination that a surety bond is available at reasonable cost, to withdraw all cash held in the Reserve Fund and to substitute a surety bond in an amount equal to the total Reserve Fund Requirement for all Outstanding Parity Bonds on the effective date of the surety bond. The Director of Finance is authorized and directed to select a provider of the surety bond through a selection process acceptable to him. The Director of Finance and each of the other appropriate officers of the City are further authorized to enter into such agreements and execute all such documents, consistent with the terms of the Parity Bond Legislation and this ordinance, as, in their judgment, are necessary and appropriate to acquire the surety bond. Any reimbursement obligation that is created by any such agreement shall be an obligation of the Light Fund and not a general obligation of the City.

 Section 3. Establishment of Contingency Reserve Account. There is hereby established a Contingency Reserve Account in the Light Fund.

 Section 4. Deposit of Cash Withdrawn from the Reserve Fund. On the effective date of the surety bond, all cash withdrawn from the Reserve Fund pursuant to this ordinance shall be deposited in the Light Fund. $25,000,000 of such cash shall be deposited in the Contingency Reserve Account within the Light Fund. The amount necessary to pay the premium for the surety bond and transaction costs may be withdrawn from the Light Fund and spent for that purpose. The remainder of the funds deposited to the Light Fund shall be used for additional debt reduction, either by transferring the funds to the Construction Account of the Light Fund where the funds will be used for authorized capital expenditures, thereby reducing future debt issuance, or by using the funds to defease outstanding City Light obligations as may be authorized by future ordinance.

 Section 5. Increase in Budget. The General Expense budget control level for the City Light Department (SCL800) in the 2005 Adopted City Budget is amended to include the purchase of a surety bond as authorized in this ordinance, which purchase shall be funded by the appropriation made in section 6.

 Section 6. Appropriation. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses to be incurred in 2005, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriation for the general expense budget control level in the 2005 Adopted City Budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount t Light (41000) City Light General Expense (SCL 800) $3,000,000

 Section 7. General Authorization. The Mayor and the Director of Finance and each of the other appropriate officers of the City are each authorized and directed to do everything as in their judgment may be necessary, appropriate, or desirable in order to carry out the terms and provisions of, and complete the transactions contemplated by, this ordinance.

 Section 8. Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If a court of competent jurisdiction, all appeals having been exhausted or all appeal periods having run, finds any provision of this ordinance to be invalid or unenforceable as to any person or circumstance, such offending provision shall, if feasible, be deemed to be modified to be within the limits of enforceability or validity. However, if the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be null and void with respect to the particular person or circumstance, and all other provisions of this ordinance in all other respects, and the offending provision with respect to all other persons and all other circumstances, shall remain valid and enforceable.

 Section 9. Ratification of Prior Acts. Any action taken consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance, including, if applicable, but not limited to issuing requests for proposals for financing or underwriting services, executing engagement letters for financing or underwriting services based on responses to such requests, giving notices of the sale of Bonds, executing contracts or other documents, making fund transfers, and paying warrants, is ratified, approved, and confirmed.
