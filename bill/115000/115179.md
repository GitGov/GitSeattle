 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Cadillac Hotel project; authorizing the Director of the Office of Economic Development to permit the release of certain money deposited by Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority under agreements authorized by Ordinance 121456.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 121456, the City Council authorized a loan for the Cadillac Hotel project from a portion of the proceeds of a City note guaranteed by the federal government under the Section 108 program;

 WHEREAS Ordinance 121456 established a Project Advisory Committee to monitor the progress of the rehabilitation of the Cadillac Hotel; and

 WHEREAS, under the loan agreement authorized by Ordinance 121456 and ancillary contracts required by the Director of the Office of Economic Development, in addition to the real property security for the loan, Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority ("HSPDA") deposited money in certain restricted accounts to assure sufficient funds would be available to complete the project and to cover any operating deficits prior to the leasing of all of the space in the building, with such money to be released on certain terms and conditions, including without limitation achieving stabilized operating income of the Property after rehabilitation, or to be used for project costs;

 WHEREAS HSPDA has reported that the rehabilitation project is more than 50% complete and that it believes all material unexpected conditions of the building have been identified, that the chance of any major unforeseen substantial costs is remote, and that the project will be completed significantly under budget;

 WHEREAS HSPDA also has reported that the federal government has agreed to lease all of the space in the Cadillac Hotel building, which removes the uncertainty as to rental revenue after completion; and

 WHEREAS, HSPDA has requested that such money be released by the City in order that HSPDA may apply it to other purposes within its mission; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.

The release of such money may be permitted at such times, which may be prior to project completion, and subject to such conditions, as the OED Director deems advisable, considering the status of the Cadillac Hotel project and the public benefits to be realized from the timely availability of such money for other purposes of the HSPDA.

 Section 2. The OED Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, perform and administer such agreements, and modifications to existing agreements, as she shall deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of this ordinance.
