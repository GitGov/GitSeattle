 2. City retains, in its ownership of the underlying fee, the right to grant or deny permission to use or occupy the Easement Area for any other purpose, including use by non-City utility agencies; provided that such use or occupancy shall not unreasonably or permanently conflict with the roadway and drainage purposes herein granted; and provided that such non-City utility agencies shall be required to restore roadway in accordance with County standards. Any permission granted for use or occupancy of the Easement Area is subject to all rules, regulations and laws governing the construction, operation and maintenance of such use, and shall not be construed to replace or to be used in lieu of any permit or licenses which may be required, granted or supervised by any other agency or subdivision of government.

 3. County shall be responsible for the design, construction, maintenance and safety of a roadway, together with storm drainage facilities, within the Easement Area, which shall be at no cost or expense to City.
