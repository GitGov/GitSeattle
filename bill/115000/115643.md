 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of the City Auditor; transferring appointment authority from the Chair of the Finance Committee to the City Council; changing the term of office from six (6) to four (4) years; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.40.010.

 WHEREAS, Section 2 of Article VIII of the City Charter and Section 3.40.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code currently provide that the Chair of the City Council Finance Committee shall appoint the City Auditor, subject to confirmation by a majority of the City Council, and that the term for the City Auditor is six years; and

 WHEREAS, the scope of audits conducted by the City Auditor is much broader than just financial audits and therefore it is more appropriate to have a majority of the entire City Council appoint the City Auditor; and

 WHEREAS, a term of office of four years for the City Auditor is more consistent with the terms of other City department heads; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has adopted Resolution 30896 as a companion to this Council Bill, submitting a proposition to the voters of the City to amend the Charter relating to the appointment authority and term of office for the City Auditor; and
