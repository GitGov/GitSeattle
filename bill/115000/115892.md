 ORDINANCE _________________ AN ORDINANCE relating to the provision of civil legal assistance for domestic violence victims; revising a budget proviso that restricts spending in the Human Services Department's 2007 Adopted Budget, Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention Budget Control Level.

 WHEREAS, the 2005-2009 Strategic Plan on Seattle's Criminal Justice Response to Domestic Violence recommends that the criminal justice system create a comprehensive system-based set of advocacy services for victims of domestic violence; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council approved an additional $135,000 for 2007 and $270,000 for 2008 in the Seattle Human Services Department's Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention Budget Control Level with the intent that it be used solely for legal assistance and other high priority advocacy services for domestic violence victims, as recommended by the City's Domestic Violence Prevention Council and the Human Services Department; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council prohibited spending more than $3,166,927 of the funds appropriated for Seattle Human Services Department's Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention Budget Control Level until authorized by a future ordinance, and

 "No more than $3,166,927 appropriated for 2007 (and no more than $3,028,922 of the money endorsed for 2008) for the Human Services Department's Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention BCL may be spent, until authorized by a future ordinance. Council anticipates that such authority will not be granted until the Domestic Violence Council and the Human Services Department make recommendations to the Council for specific use of the additional appropriated or endorsed funding and Council reviews the recommendations." is removed, and the provisions of Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 122298 no longer apply to this portion of the proviso.
