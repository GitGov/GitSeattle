 WHEREAS, the Director of Executive Administration has authority under SMC Section 9.25.035 to investigate and determine that an animal is dangerous, and determine whether the dangerous animal is subject to humane disposal or removal from the owner to a secure animal shelter; and

 WHEREAS, in 2006, the Washington Court of Appeals ruled that public agencies have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that such determinations are correct, and that the animal owner has the right to subpoena witnesses and documents when challenging such determinations in an administrative proceeding; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Animal Code must be revised to comply with the Court of Appeals ruling; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 * * *

 C. Standard of Review. Appeals shall be considered de novo. The ~~owner~~City shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the Director's decision was ~~incorrect~~correct. In the case of an order ordering the humane disposal of exotic animals or livestock under SMC 9.25.030 A4, the owner shall have the burden of proving that a reasonable alternative disposition is available. In the case of a directive of humane disposal for dangerous animals, the ~~owner~~City shall have the burden of proving that the Director's decision not to allow the animal to be sent to a secure animal shelter was not arbitrary and capricious.

 Section 2. Subsection A of Section 9.25.037 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby revised as follows:

 A. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the review of an appeal in an expedited manner and shall make a decision thereon. The procedures of Sections 3.02.090 and 3.02.100 of this code shall apply, including but not limited to the ability to subpoena witnesses and documents as provided in HER 3.12, as amended, except that the intervals for action shall be compressed so that, unless both the owner and Director consent, the time elapsed between the date of the notice of appeal and the Hearing Examiner's determination shall not exceed thirty (30) days.
