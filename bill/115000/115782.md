 Exhibit A: LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN CITY OF SEATTLE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL ENGINEERS, LOCAL 17

 12/1/06 Version #3 t LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN CITY OF SEATTLE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

 AND

 INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL ENGINEERS, LOCAL 17

 The City and I.F.P.T.E, Local 17 have agreed to the following terms in the matter of the Permit Specialist reclassification study initiated by the Department of Planning and Development.

 This proposal is directly related to and a continuation of the agreement entered into between the City and Local 17 with regard to the Permit Technician class series.

 1. Recognition

 The City recognizes Local 17 as the exclusive bargaining representative for all regular/probationary full-time, part-time or temporary employees in the titles of the Permit Specialist I and Permit Specialist II, as the duties being specified to these new titles are currently performed by Local 17. This title will be accreted to Local 17's Technical Unit.

 [This proposal is directly related to and a continuation of the agreement entered into between the City and Local 17 with regard to the Permit Technician class series.]

 2. Seniority

 > Per the agreement entered into at negotiations for the Permit Technician portion of this study, time in the Technician series will be counted toward seniority for the purposes of lay-off order for all members moving into the Specialist series as part of this agreement. All new members of the PS I series will have the same effective date for entry into the class, April 15, 2006. Retroactive pay for PS I work performed prior to this date will be calculated separately as out-of-class pay and will not count as time served in the class. For those incumbents who are underfilling a PS I position under the previous agreement, the effective date in the class will be the date it is determined by management that they have fulfilled the expectations of their training plan and are promoted.

 > In case of layoff, current PSs, who will be classified as PS IIs under the new structure, will be able to bump members in the PS I classification based on total time in both the PS and PT series. This is in alignment with the previous agreement in which the parties determined that the PTs entering the PS I class could carry PT service credit for purposes of lay-off order.

 > New Permit Specialist Supervisors will also carry forward time in the PT series for purposes of layoff order. All new PS supervisors will have the same effective date for entry into the class, April 15, 2006. Retroactive pay for PS supervision work performed prior to this date will be calculated separately as out-of-class pay and will not affect time served in the class.

 > Permit Specialist Supervisors classified under this agreement* will have bumping rights to the Permit Technician Supervisor classification. If more than one PS Supervisor position is slated for lay-off, and given the existence of only one PT supervisor position, the least senior PS supervisor would be able to bump the least senior member of the PS I classification. Under this agreement, no bumping to the PS II class by a PS supervisor classified under this agreement is allowed, since the incumbents * have not and are not intended to supervise or perform the work of the PS II class under the current organizational structure. Due to the unusual nature of these recommendations, the names of the class members affected by this agreement are specifically listed in the attached Appendix within the final settlement document.

 > *See appendix for incumbents subject to this agreement.

 3. New Wages

 $29.14 $29.72 $30.46 $31.16

 The effective date of the wage increases offered will align with the effective date of the Technician agreement, May 7, 2003.

 4. Retroactive Pay

 Retroactive pay will be calculated for all work falling within any of the Permit Specialist classifications. Hours calculated as out-of- class pay prior to the common effective date of entry to the series for incumbents, April 15, 2006, will count toward step placement.

 As part of the agreement, the May 7, 2003 date will represent a "firewall", meaning that no appeals for an earlier retroactive pay effective date will be entertained.
