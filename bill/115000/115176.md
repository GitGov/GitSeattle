 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the municipal water system of the City; establishing new conditions for deposits into the Revenue Stabilization Subfund of the Water Fund, and amending Ordinance 120875 accordingly.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle (the "City") owns and operates a municipal water system (the "Water System"); and

 WHEREAS, reduced revenue from water sales due to extraordinary variances in weather, such as drought curtailments or cool wet summer weather, can jeopardize the financial condition of the Water System; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116705 created the Rate Stabilization Account in the Water Fund to stabilize the revenue stream of the Water System for the purpose of maintaining the debt service coverage target set by the City; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120875 redesignated the Rate Stabilization Account in the Water Fund as the "Revenue Stabilization Subfund", and established additional conditions under which revenues of the Water System shall be deposited into and withdrawn from the Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with Ordinance 116705, Seattle Public Utilities has deposited into the Revenue Stabilization Subfund revenue received from retail ratepayers and, into the Bonneville Power Administration ("BPA") Account therein, revenue received from the BPA pursuant to an agreement authorized by Ordinance 121212; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120875 recited the City's intention to set water rates to accumulate a balance of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, the Revenue Stabilization Subfund has a balance in excess of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) as of December 31, 2004 and Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) is sufficient to meet the purposes of the Subfund at this time; and

 WHEREAS, in its next review of water rates, the City Council intends to reevaluate the need for the portion of the water rate that was used to build the Nine Million Dollar ($9,000,000) balance in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to use funds in excess of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) to meet operating expenses, to pay Capital Improvement Program expenditures, or to meet Water Fund financial policies adopted by the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, when balances in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund exceed Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) due to unanticipated Metered Water Sale (MWS) revenues, it is anticipated that Seattle Public Utilities may submit for Council approval an ordinance to withdraw the excess funds to increase the cash contribution to the current year's CIP or to be retained as cash balances to offset costs in the following year; and

 WHEREAS, it is prudent to pay annual operating expenses and debt service of the Water System and make a cash contribution to its Capital Improvement Program, and to maintain an operating cash balance in the Water Fund, in accordance with Water Fund financial policies approved by the City Council, before depositing additional money in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with Ordinance 121212 and to the extent included in Adopted City Budgets, the City desires to withdraw funds annually from the BPA Account of the Rate Stabilization Subfund to pay for certain mitigation and enhancement activities in the Cedar River watershed, NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Sections 2, 3, and 4 of Ordinance 120875 are amended as follows:

 * * *

 Section 2. Deposits to the Revenue Stabilization Subfund. By December 31 of each year, commencing in 2003, there shall be deposited in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) from metered water sales ("MWS") revenue until the balance of such MWS revenues in the Subfund equals Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) after which time such mandatory deposits will cease. In addition, upon the earlier of completion of Water System accounting for each fiscal year or ninety (90) days after the end of the closed fiscal year (commencing with closed fiscal year 2003), there shall be deposited in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund, after payment of State and City taxes, all revenue collected from metered water sales to retail and wholesale customers in the closed fiscal year in excess of the planned revenue from such sales contained in the adopted Water System budget for that year.~~together with all interest earnings thereon.~~If, at any time, the balance of MWS revenues in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund is less than Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000), then within one year Seattle Public Utilities shall submit a water rate proposal that provides for deposits of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) per year into the Revenue Stabilization Subfund until a balance of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) is achieved.

In addition to these mandatory deposits of MWS revenues, Seattle Public Utilities may make discretionary deposits of MWS revenues or any other Water System revenues. Deposits into the Revenue Stabilization Subfund, whether mandatory or discretionary, shall be limited each year to those revenues that are not required to meet financial policies adopted by the City Council with respect to debt service coverage, cash funding of the Capital Improvement Program, and the operating fund cash balance of the Water Fund.

 Section 3. Withdrawals from the Revenue Stabilization Subfund. All money deposited in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund ~~and all interest earnings thereon~~ shall remain in that Subfund until withdrawals are authorized by ordinance of the City Council.  Withdrawals of Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Account funds, however, may occur without a subsequent ordinance as provided in subsection B.

A. It is anticipated that the balance in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund will be maintained at a minimum of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) in MWS revenue. Withdrawals of MWS revenues that lower the balance below this level will occur only when funds are needed to offset shortfalls in MWS revenues and when the financial performance of the Water Fund would otherwise fall short of the targets set in the Water Fund financial policies adopted by the City Council. It is further anticipated that withdrawals of funds in excess of the Nine Million Dollar ($9,000,000) minimum balance pursuant to subsequent ordinance will be used to meet operating expenses, to pay Capital Improvement Program expenditures, or to meet the Water Fund financial policies adopted by the City Council.

B. Consistent with adopted budgets, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities may withdraw moneys periodically from the BPA Account of the Revenue Stabilization Subfund, for inclusion in the Water System's adjusted gross revenue and for paying the cost of mitigation and enhancement activities in the Cedar River Watershed, as described in Ordinance 121212. Unless authorized by subsequent ordinance, withdrawals in any year from the BPA Account shall not exceed the amount of the operating transfer shown for the BPA Account in the Water Fund revenue table in the City's Adopted Budget for that year.

 Section 4. Water System Budget. The adopted Water System budget for ~~2003~~2006 and thereafter shall indicate the planned deposits into the Revenue Stabilization Subfund, if any, for that year. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities periodically shall revise projections of deposits to the Revenue Stabilization Subfund and revenues from metered water sales based on weather conditions, demand and unforeseen circumstances that have occurred in the current year. ~~On~~By each May 1 and September 1, the Director shall report these revised projections to the City Council.

 * * *

 Section 2. Ratification of Prior Acts. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2005.
