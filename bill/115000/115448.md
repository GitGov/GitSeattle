 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Pioneer Square Parking and Business Improvement Area; increasing the maximum total annual assessment; and amending Ordinance 111244, as previously amended by Ordinances 114396 and 115838.

 WHEREAS, the Pioneer Square Parking and Business Improvement Area (PBIA) was established in 1983 through Ordinance 111244, to provide services and amenities for ratepayer businesses paid for through a levy of special assessments; and

 WHEREAS, the last rate increase for the Pioneer Square PBIA was in 1991, and since then the Consumer Price Index for the Seattle area has risen approximately 45%, affecting the cost of providing services; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed ceiling increase will produce an increase of approximately 17% in total annual revenues available to the Pioneer Square PBIA; and

 WHEREAS, ten of the thirteen ratepayers who reached the current maximum total annual assessment in 2004 have expressed support of the proposed increase in the maximum total annual assessment; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 2 of Ordinance 111244, as amended by Ordinances 114396 and 115838, is hereby amended as follows:

 Section 2. Special Assessments. To finance the activities authorized in Section 3, there is levied and shall be collected a special assessment upon the businesses in the area, determined as follows:

 A. Upon persons engaged within the area in the making of sales at retail as defined in Seattle Municipal code Section 5.44.030C, a special assessment equal to the gross proceeds of such sales multiplied by the rate of One Dollar Twenty Five Cents per Thousand Dollars; ($1.25 per $1,000; 0.125%) and

 B. Upon all other persons engaged in business in the area, unless exempted in the next paragraph of this Section, a special assessment equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of Thirty-one cents per Thousand Dollars ($0.31 per $1,000 or 0.031%).

 C. The total assessment upon any business within the area shall not exceed ~~$2,000~~$4,000 per annum.

 D. The minimum assessment upon any business within the area subject to assessment located on or below the ground floor shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per annum and the minimum assessment upon all other persons engaged in business in the area subject to assessments shall be Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per annum.

 Special Assessments shall be made under each applicable classification but any transaction considered in computing the gross proceeds of sales under Subsection A shall not again be considered in calculating the gross income of the business under Subsection B.

 No special assessments shall be levied upon and collected from:

 (1) Organizations to which a charitable contribution may be made under the United States Internal Revenue Code, 26 USC section 170(c);

 (2) Sponsors of public events, and vendors or entertainers, who engage in business activities in the area for less than 30 days in aggregate per year;

 (3) Persons, who have no business location in the area and generate income or gross receipts from within the area only from making sales to or providing services to businesses located within the area rather than doing business with the public.

 (4) Governmental agencies.

 Insofar as consistent with this ordinance and RCW Chapter 35.87A, special assessments shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the City's Business Tax levied by Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Chapter 5.44. The terms "gross proceeds of sales" and "gross income of the business" shall have the meanings in SMC section 5.44.010; the determination of value (SMC section 5.44.060), the exemptions (SMC section 5.44.010 - .100), the deductions (SMC section 5.44.110), and the principles of apportionment (SMC section 5.44.070 - .078) apply in calculating each amount.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2005, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2005.
