Positions will be designated by the Personnel Director to Executive titles. The appointing authority shall have the discretion to set and/or modify an executive's base salary anywhere within the pay zone for any such position under his or her direction within formal budget and spending limits established by the Mayor and the City Council.

The Personnel Director is authorized to administer the APEX Compensation Program and to develop and maintain a plan document that describes the program's elements. Any revisions to the program elements must be approved by the Mayor and the City Council. The Personnel Director shall recommend to the City Council for approval adjustments to the salary structure based on a biennial labor market analysis of selected benchmark titles. The appointing authority may award to each APEX employee under his or her direction a base salary increase up to the maximum approved market adjustment; provided, no APEX incumbent shall be eligible for such an adjustment if his or her performance in the most recent evaluation cycle failed to be described as "satisfactory" or better.
