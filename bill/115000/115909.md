 Section 7. Subsection X of Section 21.49.110 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 21.49.110 Electric service connection provisions.

 X. Letter of Credit or Cash Deposit for New or Enlarged Services. Any applicant or customer that receives Department authorization for a new or enlarged service installation, the consumption of which would be billed under any of the Department's Large General Service or High Demand General Service rate schedules (Schedules ~~LGD~~LGC, LGS, LGH, LGT, LGD, HDC and HDT), as determined by the Department, shall be required to obtain a letter of credit in favor of the Department that is issued by a bank acceptable to the Department, or make a cash deposit with the Department, in the amount of the material and labor costs of the transformers and associated equipment (including network protectors) required for that installation before the Department approves the service for connection. The standards to be applied to the letter of credit will be set forth in a Departmental Policy and Procedure.

 If the Department determines that, within 36 calendar months of the date of the Department's approval of the service for connection, the maximum kilowatt demand of the installation over six or more months of normal billings in a calendar year reached eighty (80) percent of the maximum kilowatt demand requested by the applicant or customer, the applicant or customer shall have no obligation to pay the material and labor costs of the transformers and associated equipment (including network protectors) for the installation. If an applicant or customer has deposited cash, the Department shall, within 30 days of such determination, refund the deposit with interest earned at the rate of interest on the City's cash pool for the period during which the deposit was held, to the applicant or customer's last known address. It shall be the applicant or customer's responsibility to notify the Department of the appropriate address. If an applicant or customer has obtained a letter of credit and the Department determines that the required demand has been met, the Department shall so notify the applicant or customer and, upon request, so notify the provider of the letter of credit.

 If the Department determines that, within 36 calendar months of the date of the Department's approval of the service for connection, the required demand has not been met, the applicant or customer shall reimburse the Department for the material and labor costs of the transformers and associated equipment (including network protectors) required for that installation. If an applicant or customer has deposited cash, the Department shall retain the deposit for its uses and the applicant or customer shall have no further claim to such money. If an applicant or customer has obtained a letter of credit, the Department shall, within 30 days after such determination, bill the applicant or customer for the full amount of the letter of credit, at the address most recently provided to the Department. If such amount is not paid within 30 days after the date of the invoice, the Department may call on the letter of credit.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
