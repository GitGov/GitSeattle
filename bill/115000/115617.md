 WHEREAS, the energy market has emerged from the 2000-2001 crisis, City Light's financial condition has improved significantly, City Light has a new organizational structure, and the recommendations for improved oversight of City Light have been implemented; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 121059, the City has determined that the Advisory Board should not be continued and should be replaced with a new Advisory Committee of industry experts available to provide advice on specified topics to the Mayor, Council, and City Light Superintendent; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Establishment of a City Light Advisory Committee. A City Light Advisory Committee is hereby established consisting of six members with three members appointed by the Council and three members appointed by the Mayor, all subject to City Council confirmation. The Mayor and Council each shall appoint one Advisory Committee member for a one year term (except that the first such term shall end on January 31, 2008), one Advisory Committee member for a two year term (except that the first such term shall end on January 31, 2009), and one Advisory Committee member for a three year term (except that the first such term shall end on January 31, 2010). Thereafter, upon expiration of Board members' terms, the Mayor and the Council each shall appoint a Board member for a term concluding on January 31, 2010. Board members shall be eligible for reappointment. In order to provide expert industry-specific knowledge and nonpartisan advice to the Mayor, the City Council, and the City Light Superintendent, each Advisory Committee member should have demonstrated expertise and experience in one or more of the following areas: business, finance, energy conservation, environmental protection, energy law, utility operations, and power/risk management. The Advisory Committee members shall comply with the City Code of Ethics as may be required by the Ethics and Elections Commission. No Advisory Committee member shall be retained, either directly or indirectly, to provide consulting services to City Light while serving as a member of the Advisory Committee. Members shall be subject to removal by the appointing authority for cause. If, for any reason, a member does not serve his or her full term, the appointing authority will appoint a new member to complete the remainder of that term.

 All Advisory Committee meetings shall be open to the public and shall meet the requirements of the Open Public Meetings Act.

 Section 2. Mission of the Advisory Committee. It is the City's intent that the Advisory Committee serve as technical experts to provide advice to the Mayor, City Council, and City Light Superintendent in accordance with Section 3. No member of the Advisory Committee shall serve as an advocate on issues or as a voice for special interest groups when functioning as an Advisory Committee member. To help ensure that the Advisory Committee will fulfill its mission, the Advisory Committee shall (i) hold regular public meetings and keep a written record of proceedings which shall be a public record and (ii) select a Chair from among its members and adopt rules and procedures necessary to accomplish its purpose, including quorum requirements and the frequency of meetings.

 Section 3. Work Plan. The Advisory Committee shall work on projects contained in a work plan developed collaboratively with the Mayor, Council and City Light Superintendent. The annual work plan of the Advisory Committee shall emphasize items included in the work programs of City Light and the City Council Energy and Technology Committee (or its successor committee). By December 1 of each year, the Advisory Committee shall propose a new work plan for the next calendar year, with a list of issues and scope of work. The Mayor and City Council shall provide written approval of, or required changes to, the proposed work plan by letter within 60 days of its receipt. Any changes to an approved work plan desired by the Advisory Committee shall also be approved by the City Council and Mayor.

 Section 4. Reporting Requirements. No later than January 31st of each year, the Advisory Committee shall provide the Mayor, City Council, and the City Light Superintendent with a written report summarizing the activities, recommendations and expenses of the Advisory Committee relating to its work plan for the previous calendar year, as well as copies of the meeting minutes and votes on policy recommendations, though receipt of these materials shall not constitute approval of any recommendations contained therein.

 Section 5. Staff Support for Advisory Committee. The Executive will provide logistical support, including scheduling of meetings, preparation of agendas, organization of meeting materials and recording of meeting minutes. Within the time constraints imposed by their responsibilities, both Executive and Council staff will be available, at the mutual agreement of the Committee and the staff directors, to assist them in their analysis and deliberations.

 Section 6. Consideration of Advisory Committee Recommendations. The Mayor and City Council shall take into consideration, but shall not be obligated to accept, recommendations of the Advisory Committee, including both majority and minority opinions. Recommendations or proposals of the Advisory Board created by Ordinance 121059 and earlier studies upon which Advisory Board recommendations were based will remain part of the public record, but will have no binding force or effect.

 Section 7. Termination of Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee shall automatically terminate as of January 31, 2010, unless it is extended by ordinance.

 Section 8. Repeal. Ordinance 121059 is hereby repealed.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
