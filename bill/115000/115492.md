 AN ORDINANCE related to cable television; modifying cable television franchise fees; amending Ordinance 121985 concerning cable television franchise fee credits; and increasing an appropriation in the 2006 budget of the Department of Information Technology; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, cable television companies operate within the City of Seattle ("City") under cable franchise agreements ("Agreements") that require them to pay franchise fees based on gross revenues as consideration for use of the City's rights-of-way; and

 WHEREAS, the existing Agreements provide that the franchise fee paid by cable operators shall be five percent (5.0%); and

 WHEREAS, the existing Agreements allow for a credit against the franchise fee payment due to the City which is set annually by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the franchise fee credit set for 2006 by Ordinance 121985 established an effective franchise fee rate of 3.5% of gross revenues which is the maximum allowed by the existing Agreements; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinances 121652 and 121985, establishing the cable franchise fee credits for 2005 and 2006 respectively, inadvertently referred to subsection H of SMC 5.48.050 after that subsection had been re-lettered as subsection I by Ordinance 121673, and the City has always intended to refer to the subsection containing the City's Utility B&O tax rate for cable television systems, which is now subsection I; and

 WHEREAS, Comcast of Washington I, Inc. and Comcast of Washington IV, Inc. (collectively "Comcast") are authorized to provide cable services in the city in accordance with a cable franchise agreement authorized by Ordinance 117956, as amended, which expired on January 20, 2006; and

 WHEREAS, Comcast has agreed to waive the franchise fee credit provided under its Agreement and set by Ordinance 121985 pending a renewed Agreement which is expected to be approved by ordinance in 2006 and which does not include a franchise fee credit; and

 WHEREAS, for operations by Comcast and any other cable operator under a franchise that may be granted following the effective date of this ordinance, the City wishes to establish the franchise fee at 4.2% of gross revenues and eliminate the franchise fee credit; and

 WHEREAS, the City will use a portion of the increased effective franchise fee to provide funding for public access channel operations, under a contract authorized by Ordinance 120214, as that contract has been amended by the Chief Technology Officer, with the Seattle Community Access Network (SCAN), the City's Designated Public Access Manager, and wishes to increase an appropriation in the 2006 budget of the Department of Information Technology for this purpose; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The franchise fee for cable operators doing business in Seattle shall be as follows:

 (a) For business done under a franchise agreement that has not passed its end or expiration date and that provides for a credit against the franchise fee, the franchise fee shall be five percent (5.0%) of gross revenues;

 (b) For business done under a franchise agreement that has passed its end or expiration date and that provided for a credit against the franchise fee, but for which no ordinance authorizing a renewed franchise agreement has yet taken effect, the franchise fee shall be five percent (5.0%) of gross revenues;

 (c) For business done under a franchise agreement or other agreement not covered by subsections (a) or (b), the franchise fee shall be four and two-tenths percent (4.2%) of gross revenues.

 Section 2. Section 1 of Ordinance 121985 is amended as follows:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2006, the credit against franchise fees for business done by cable operators ~~doing business~~ under Seattle franchise agreements that provide for a credit against the franchise fee shall be thirty-seven and one half percent (37.5%) of the difference between the City's Utility B&O tax rate for cable television systems (SMC ~~5.48.050H~~5.48.050 I  and the City's Utility B&O telecommunications tax rate (SMC 5.48.050A) for 2006.  For all other business done by cable operators, there shall be no credit against franchise fees. For purposes of this section and Section 1 of the ordinance introduced as C.B. 115492 only, a cable operator that is doing business under a franchise agreement that has passed its end or expiration date and that provided for a credit against the franchise fee, but for which no ordinance authorizing a renewed franchise agreement has yet taken effect, is deemed to be doing business under a franchise agreement that provides for a credit against the franchise fee.
