 WHEREAS, Sound Transit (formally known as the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority) is proceeding to implement the Sound Move plan; and

 WHEREAS, an integral part of Sound Transit's Regional Express program, which implements portions of the Sound Move plan, is a project to provide an all-day, two-way transit and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility on I-90 between Seattle and the east side of Lake Washington; and

 WHEREAS, on April 25, 2003, Sound Transit, the Washington State Department of Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration issued a draft environmental impact statement to satisfy the requirements of both the National Environmental Policy Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act; and

 WHEREAS, on July 14, 2003, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30613 relating to the I-90 Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations project; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has a significant interest and stake in the outcome of the I-90 Two -Way Transit and HOV Operations project; and

 WHEREAS, the parties to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement, the execution of which was authorized by Ordinance 106077, agree that Alternative R-8A with High Capacity Transit deployed in the center lanes is the ultimate configuration for I-90 in this segment; and

 WHEREAS, construction of the R-8A alignment shall commence once Alternative R-8A is adopted through an amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement, and the funding is acquired, and this shall be the first step toward the ultimate configuration; and

 WHEREAS, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing and future studies and upon the acquisition of funding, the center roadway is to be converted to two-way High Capacity Transit operation; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to the principles of the 1976 Memorandum

 Agreement, which specifically limit the facility to "accommodate no more than eight motor vehicle lanes" with no more than "three general-purpose lanes in each direction," and notes that the Amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement does not change that configuration; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to seeking funding for the implementation of High Capacity Transit simultaneously with the implementation of Alternative R-8A; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle considers light rail transit as the preferred technology for High Capacity Transit operations in the I-90 corridor; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle wants to ensure that key policy principles are articulated in an amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement prior to implementation of the I-90 Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations project; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed Ordinance 121514 on June 28, 2004, authorizing the Mayor to sign the Amendment; and

 WHEREAS, after passage of Ordinance 121514 and before all parties had executed the Amendment, the parties to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement agreed to changes in the language of the Amendment ("the Revised Amendment"); and
