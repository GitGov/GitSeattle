 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE accepting a quit claim deed for a portion of Pine Street and Alaskan Way previously vacated (subject to certain conditions) in Ordinance 117279 for the Port of Seattle's Central Waterfront Project, and establishing, laying off and dedicating the area for street purposes.

 WHEREAS, in 1988 and 1990, the Port of Seattle petitioned the City Council for the vacation of various streets in support of its Central Waterfront Project (Clerk File Nos. 296649 and 297673), a proposal to redevelop the Port's central waterfront property with housing, offices, retail, and hotel uses, as well as a multipurpose trail, hill climb assists, and a skybridge; and

 WHEREAS, the Central Waterfront Project anticipated that in order to accommodate the development of housing adjacent to Pine Street, the existing Pine Street's diagonal connection to Alaskan Way should be vacated and a new Pine Street should be repositioned to the south with a standard perpendicular connection to Alaskan Way; and

 WHEREAS, in 1994, the City Council approved the Port's petitions and passed Ordinance 117279, amended by Ordinance 117593, vacating various rights-of-way, subject to certain conditions, in the central waterfront area including, Pine Street between Alaskan Way and the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and a portion of Alaskan Way lying south of Pine Street; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117279 also accepted a Property Use and Development Agreement (Agreement), King County Recording Number 9408050461, as amended by amendment King County Recording Number 9408190264, detailing a number of vacation conditions including a requirement that the Port of Seattle or its successors realign, construct, and dedicate a new Pine Street segment prior to eliminating use of the existing Pine Street as a public street; and

 WHEREAS, the Agreement required reconveyance of the vacated portions of Pine Street and Alaskan Way if the Port or its successors did not apply for the permits to construct the new Pine Street alignment within six years from the date of the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Port of Seattle conveyed its interest in the vacated portions of Pine Street and Alaskan Way to Intracorp Waterfront Landings, L.L.C. which conveyed its interest to Pumpkin & Big Man, L.L.C. (now known as Pumpkin, Big Man, Ole2 and Kabu, L.L.C.); and

 WHEREAS, neither the Port nor any of its successors in ownership of vacated Pine Street and Alaskan Way met the requirement to build a realigned Pine Street within the required timeframe of the Agreement, and the housing was built without using the vacated right-of-way; and

 WHEREAS, Pumpkin, Big Man, Ole2 & Kabu, L.L.C. are the legal owners of the vacated Pine Street and Alaskan Way, and have executed and conveyed a quit claim deed to the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
