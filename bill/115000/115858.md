 WHEREAS, the City allowed A&B to enter the Ballard Line to increase the scope of its independent cleanup action by installing groundwater monitoring wells and a funnel-and-gate reactive iron wall system for treatment of groundwater on and under a portion of the Ballard Line; and

 WHEREAS, A&B has installed additional groundwater monitoring wells and a second funnel-and-gate reactive iron wall system on and under the AMBK Property and continues to monitor the groundwater under the Ballard Line and the AMBK Property; and

 WHEREAS, there are significant costs and risks associated with litigation under MTCA; and

 EXHIBIT 1 to Jacobson Transfer Ordinance

 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

 This Settlement Agreement ("Agreement") is dated and effective as of the ___day of_______________, 200_ by and among The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation (the "City"), A&B Jacobson LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("A&B"), Jacobson Terminals, Inc., a Washington corporation ("JTI"), Alan R. and Margie E. Jacobson and their marital community ("A&M Jacobson"), and Bryan K. and Karen R. Jacobson and their marital community ("B&K Jacobson"). A&B, JTI, A&M Jacobson, and B&K Jacobson are collectively referred to herein as "Jacobsons." Alan R. Jacobson, Margie E. Jacobson, Bryan K. Jacobson, and Karen R. Jacobson are collectively referred to herein as "Jacobson Individuals."

 RECITALS

 A. A&B is the former owner of the real property described on Attachment A attached hereto and incorporated herein ("A&B Property").

 B. A&M Jacobson and B&K Jacobson are the owners of the real property described on Attachment B attached hereto and incorporated herein ("AMBK Property").

 C. JTI is the owner of buildings and other improvements on the AMBK Property.

 D. The City is the owner of the former Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company railroad corridor in the Ballard district of Seattle ("Railroad Corridor"). A portion of the Railroad Corridor is between the A&B Property and the AMBK Property and is described on Attachment C attached hereto and incorporated herein ("City Property").

 E. In 1997 and 1998, A&B investigated groundwater conditions beneath portions of the A&B Property, the AMBK Property and the City Property and determined that the groundwater under these properties was contaminated with chlorinated solvents in excess of standards set under the Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA").

 F. A&B prepared a cleanup action plan dated June 22, 1999 ("Cleanup Action Plan"). Pursuant to the Cleanup Action Plan, A&B constructed a funnel-and-gate reactive iron wall system for treatment of groundwater ("Treatment Wall") and groundwater monitoring wells ("Wells"). The Treatment Wall is located under portions of the City Property and the AMBK Property. The Wells are located on and under the City Property, A&B Property and AMBK Property. The locations of the Treatment Wall and Wells are depicted on Attachment D attached hereto and incorporated herein..

 G. Following installation of the Treatment Wall and Wells and recording of a Restrictive Covenant (King County Recording No. 20010111000919) with respect to the A&B Property, a copy of which is attached hereto as Attachment E, A&B sold the A&B Property to Triad Market Street, LLC ("Triad") on January 31, 2001.

 H. A&B obtained a No Further Action letter from the Department of Ecology ("Ecology") for the A&B Property dated March 13, 2001 ("A&B NFA Letter"). A copy of the A&B NFA is attached hereto as Attachment F.

 I. Jacobsons and Triad entered into the Market Street Property Environmental Indemnity Agreement dated as of January 15, 2002 and recorded under King County Recording No. 20020117001838 ("A&B Property Agreement"). A copy is attached hereto as Attachment G.

 J. As a result of elevated levels of certain chlorinated solvents and PCBs in the groundwater beneath the AMBK Property resulting from activities on the AMBK property, A&B constructed a second groundwater treatment wall under the AMBK Property in December, 2003 and January, 2004 ("Second Treatment Wall") pursuant to the Draft Cleanup Action Plan, Jacobson Terminals, prepared by Aspect Consulting, dated August 27, 2003 and Jacobson Terminals Cleanup Action Plan Follow-up, prepared by Aspect Consulting, dated November 21, 2003. The Second Treatment Wall is depicted on Attachment D.

 K. A&B is continuing to monitor groundwater under the City Property and the AMBK Property.

 L. Analytical results from A&B's most recent annual groundwater sampling, April 2006, show that chlorinated solvents in groundwater under the City Property upgradient of the Treatment Wall still exceed MTCA standards.

 M. Jacobsons estimate that costs of the Cleanup Action Plan, the Treatment Wall, the Second Treatment Wall, ongoing monitoring activities, reporting to Ecology, and negotiation of a No Further Action letter for the benefit of the City Property now exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) ("Remedial Action Expenses"). Jacobsons contend that they are entitled to contribution from the City for some of these expenses under applicable state and federal laws.

 N. The City disputes liability and the amounts subject to contribution, but desires to continue to cooperate with Jacobsons' monitoring and cleanup activities, to resolve any potential contribution liability with respect to Remedial Action Expenses and future remedial action costs relating to the environmental conditions, to protect against liability for groundwater contamination and to avoid the expense and risks of litigation.

 In resolution of liability and contribution issues, the parties agree as follows:

 1. Jacobsons' Obligations. In consideration of the City's property transfers described in Section 2 below, Jacobsons will do the following:

 a. Maintenance and Monitoring. Without cost or expense to the City, the Jacobson Individuals, through A&B, shall maintain the Treatment Wall, the Wells and the Second Treatment Wall, and shall perform all groundwater monitoring, reporting and additional remedial action measures required by Ecology (or other applicable governmental agency) with respect to the groundwater beneath the AMBK Property and the City Property. The Jacobson Individuals, through A&B, shall keep the Treatment Wall, Wells and Second Treatment Wall in good condition and repair at all times without cost or expense to the City until their appropriate decommissioning acceptable to the City. The Jacobson Individuals, through A&B, shall send the City copies of all correspondence, reports, data and other documents delivered to Ecology (or other applicable governmental agency) in connection with groundwater monitoring, reporting and additional remedial action measures required by Ecology (or other applicable governmental agency) with respect to the groundwater beneath the AMBK Property and the City Property. The foregoing obligations shall be binding upon the heirs, successors and assigns of the Jacobson Individuals and shall run with the AMBK Property and Parcels 1 and 2 (defined below). Any transfer of all or any fee interest in the AMBK Property or Parcels 1 and 2 shall include an express assumption of the foregoing obligations.

 b. City NFA Letter. A&B shall diligently undertake to obtain a No Further Action letter from Ecology with respect to the City Property that is acceptable to the City ("City NFA Letter"). The City acknowledges that Ecology's issuance of the City NFA Letter may be conditioned on the recording of a Restrictive Covenant for portions of the City Property or the City implementing an effective alternative system under WAC 173-340-440(8)(b), at the City's discretion. The form of any Restrictive Covenant or alternative system must be acceptable to the City. Any restrictions or conditions of use of the City Property must be consistent with use of the City Property as a rail-banked property and the City and its franchisees, licensees, and permittees must be able to construct, operate and maintain the City Property for any and all trail, utility, railroad and other transportation purposes.

 c. Insurance. The City acknowledges that A&B has delivered to the City a prepaid policy of insurance, a copy of which is attached hereto as Attachment H ("Pollution Policy"), indemnifying the City, its employees and officials, from liability, whether currently known or unknown, arising from or related to any environmental conditions, including contamination of groundwater under or adjacent to the City Property from hazardous, dangerous or toxic waste or substances (as now or hereafter defined by applicable local, state or federal environmental laws or regulations), and including the environmental conditions described in the documents listed in the A&B NFA Letter. This insurance is effective until February 14, 2010. Jacobsons shall diligently undertake to obtain for the City the right to participate in any future renewal of the Pollution Policy on the same terms and conditions as the parties to the A&B Property Agreement.

 d. Release. Upon closing, the following release shall be effective: Jacobsons, for themselves and for their heirs, successors and assigns, hereby release the City, its employees and officials, from all liability of any kind or nature, whether currently known or unknown, arising from or related to any environmental conditions, including contamination of groundwater under or adjacent to the A&B Property, the AMBK Property, and the City Property due to hazardous, dangerous or toxic waste or substances (as now or hereafter defined by applicable local, state or federal environmental laws or regulations), including the environmental conditions described in the documents listed in the A&B NFA Letter, PROVIDED that this release does not include liability arising from or related to a release of hazardous, dangerous or toxic waste or substances not already present on the A&B Property, the AMBK Property, or the City Property and occurring after the date of this Agreement due to the acts or omissions of the City. This release relates to environmental conditions and environmental compliance that touches and concerns the AMBK Property and Parcels 1 and 2 (defined below and legally described on Attachment J) and is intended to run with the AMBK Property and Parcels 1 and 2 and to bind all future transferees. Upon transfer of all or any fee interest in the AMBK Property or Parcels 1 and 2, the Jacobson Individuals shall obtain as a condition of transfer, for the benefit of the City, a release from the transferee as set forth above.

 e. Easement for Benefit of Seaborn Property. At closing, Jacobsons shall record an easement, a signed copy of which is attached hereto as Attachment I ("Jacobson-Seaborn Easement"), clarifying the rights and obligations of Jacobsons and Seaborn Marine Terminal, Inc. in connection with an existing easement burdening Parcel 2 (defined below and legally described on Attachment J attached hereto).

 f. Division of Land. Jacobsons shall be responsible, at their sole cost and expense, to comply with any applicable law or regulation governing division of land in connection with the City's transfer of Parcels 1 and 2 (defined below).

Jacobsons understand and acknowledge that the City intends eventually to complete the Burke Gilman Trail between 11th Avenue Northwest and the Government Locks, including that portion of the City Property north of the existing railroad tracks, and between NW 60th Street and Golden Gardens Park. Jacobsons shall not oppose in any manner, directly or indirectly, development and completion of the Burke Gilman Trail.

 2. City Obligations. In consideration of the Jacobsons' release and performance of obligations described in Section 1 above, the City will transfer the following:

 a. Real Property Transfer by Quit Claim Deed. At closing, the City will transfer to the Jacobson Individuals the real property legally described in Attachment J ("Parcel 1 and Parcel 2") by quit claim deed in the form attached as Attachment J ("Deed").

 b. Easement. At closing, the City will deliver to Jacobsons an easement and maintenance agreement in the form attached hereto as Attachment K ("Easement Agreement") to enable Jacobsons to carry out the obligations described in Section 1 above and the Easement Agreement.

The GRANTOR'S issuance of permits and approvals, if given, shall not waive or release GRANTEES from responsibility and liability for slope stability and lateral support.

 5. Indemnity. GRANTEES shall indemnify, defend and hold GRANTOR and Ballard Terminal Railroad Company and the successors and assigns of each of them harmless from and against any and all damages, loss, injury, claims, attorneys' fees and costs in connection with the City Property and the BTR Track, including, without limitation, costs of repair, restoration and replacement of lateral support and the BTR Track, arising from or in any way related to the negligence or intentional acts or omissions of GRANTEES, their employees, contractors, agents, tenants, licensees or invitees, in connection with all or any portion of Parcel 1 and Parcel 2.
