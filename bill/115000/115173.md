 Section 2. Section 25.05.675 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 121700, is amended as follows:

 25.05.675 Specific environmental policies.

 ***

 M. Parking.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking regulations to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb parking spillover. The City recognizes that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in SMC Sections 25.05.665 and 25.05.670, the decisionmaker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided that:

 i. No SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the downtown zones;

 ii. In the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone and for residential uses located within the Pike/Pine ~~Overlay District~~ Urban Center Village , the Capitol Hill Urban Center Village, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, and the First Hill Urban Center Village, no SEPA authority is provided for the decisionmaker to require more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code;

 iii. Parking impact mitigation for multifamily development, except in the Alki area, as described in subsection M2c below, may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity, as defined by Seattle Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on Exhibit 2, a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by SMC Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need -- for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park -- may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 d. Parking impact mitigation for projects outside of downtown zones may include but is not limited to:

 i. Transportation management programs;

 ii. Parking management and allocation plans;

 iii. Incentives for the use of alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies, parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;

 iv. Increased parking ratios, ~~unless the~~except for projects~~is~~ located within the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone, ~~or~~and residential uses located in the Pike/Pine ~~Overlay District~~ Urban Center Village, the Capitol Hill Urban Center Village, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, or the First Hill Urban Center Village; and

 v. Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may not include reduction in development density.

 ***

 Section 3. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
