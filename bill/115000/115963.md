 12.3 Neither the grant of the Easement, nor any provision of this Agreement and Easement is in conflict with any provision of any other agreement or instrument by which Grantor is bound or to which the Property is subject (including but not limited to any debts that are secured by the Property), nor shall the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Easement constitute an event of default under any such agreement or instrument.

 16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 If any dispute(s) may arise under this Agreement, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute(s) through amicable negotiations between the Department and Grantor. If such parties do not agree upon a resolution within fourteen (14) days after the first date when a party gave notice to the other of the existence of an alleged breach that is the subject of the dispute, or of the existence of any other dispute, then unless the parties shall have otherwise agreed in writing, either party shall have the right to commence such proceedings as it deems appropriate to resolve the dispute. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow additional time for cure of any breach prior to the existence of a Default or to provide a defense to any action to enforce this Agreement or the Easement.

 17. DEFAULT BY GRANTOR AND REMEDIES

 17.1 If Grantor fails to perform when required any obligation hereunder or in the Easement, or otherwise breaches any term hereof or thereof, the City may provide written notice to Grantor, specifying the nature of the breach and the reasonable number of days (at least ten (10) days but in any event the City shall not be required to allow more than sixty (60) days) after the date of the notice within which such breach must be cured. Unless Grantor fully cures all breaches specified in such notice within the time allowed, Grantor shall be in Default.

 17.2 If any provision hereof or in the Easement specifies that an event or circumstance is a Default, then such event or circumstance shall be a Default without notice, or after the notice specified in that provision, as applicable.

 17.3 In case of Default by Grantor, the City may exercise remedies as specified in Sections 19 or 20 below, or under any applicable provision of the Easement. In addition to or in lieu of the foregoing, the City shall be entitled to all remedies permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Washington. The City's rights and remedies hereunder are not exclusive, but cumulative, and the City's exercise of any right or remedy due to Grantor's failure to perform any covenant or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of, or alter, affect or prejudice any other right or remedy that the City may have under this Agreement or by law or in equity.

 18. DEFAULT BY CITY AND REMEDIES

 If, within thirty (30) days after Grantor shall have timely satisfied all conditions to the City's obligation for payment hereunder, the City shall not have tendered to Grantor full payment hereunder, then Grantor may either (1) terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City within thirty (30) days, in which case neither party shall have any liability or obligation hereunder; or (2) pursue any remedy available at law or in equity for enforcement of this Agreement, provided that the City shall not be liable for damages or any other monetary remedy in excess of the total price stated hereunder, plus interest as may be allowed by law.

 19. TERMINATION

 19.1 This Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of the Easement and shall continue in effect until the earliest to occur of:

 (i) The expiration of the Easement Term; or

 (ii) if the Grantee elects to claim liquidated damages after Default in accordance with Section 20 hereof, the date on which Grantee receives full payment of all liquidated damages.

 19.2 The City may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to Grantor in the event that, prior to payment by the City hereunder, Grantor is in Default.

 20. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

 20.1 The parties understand and agree that the City's ability to obtain value from the Easement granted is conditioned upon the development and construction of the Property and the completion, opening and availability for use and occupancy of the Facility. From the nature of this Agreement, it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages sustained as a result of the failure of the Grantor to complete or make available the Facility, or from use of the Property for purposes contrary to the terms of the Easement. As a result, the parties agree that the City shall have the right to recover, at its option, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth herein, which amounts the parties agree are a reasonable estimate of the damage to the City, and are intended to fairly measure the loss to the City and not to be punitive in nature.

 20.2 In the event that the Grantor fails to complete the Facility or otherwise fails to cause the Use Period to commence by the date required herein, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), or the amount equal to the total of any purchase money already paid by the City, whichever is less, and in either case plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date of the purchase of the Easement until the date of payment at the rate applied during the same period of time to the participating funds of the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of the City of Seattle.

 20.3 In the event of a Default after the beginning of the Use Period and prior to the expiration of the Use Period, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the Thirty- Five Thousand Seven Hundred Dollars ($35,700) for each year remaining on the Use Period (prorated for any Partial Use Year based upon the number of free uses not yet used in that year) plus interest on that amount accruing from the date of the Default in the manner described in Section 20.2.

 20.4 After the City's demand for and receipt of liquidated damages in cleared funds, the City shall, within ten (10) business days, record an instrument terminating the Easement, and this Agreement shall be terminated.

 20.5 The City may, at its option, set off any liquidated damages under this Section against any amount otherwise payable or distributable by the City to Grantor, whether or not in relation to this Agreement or the Property.

 21. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; INDEMNITY

 21.1 Grantor shall comply at its sole expense with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, Municipal Code, and ordinances of The City of Seattle; and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of their administrative agencies and the officers thereof (all of the foregoing are referred to as "applicable laws"). Grantor shall require all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply with all applicable laws, including without limitation, if any work on the Property is a public work under Washington law or is subject to contracting or labor standards resulting from any funding for the development of the property, all applicable contracting and labor standards.

 21.2 Grantor represents and warrants that, to the best of Grantor's knowledge any activities in connection with the Grantor's development of the Property prior to this Agreement have been in compliance with all applicable laws.

 21.3 Grantor shall defend and indemnify the City and its officers and employees from and against any claim, demand, liability or loss resulting from the failure of Grantor or of any contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable laws, including without limitation any applicable laws regarding public works.

 21.4 This Section 21 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 22. APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE

 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in the Superior Court for King County.

 23. HEADINGS

 The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not define or limit the contents.

The Grantor shall, at its sole cost and expense, obtain any and all consents and/or subordinations of other interests in the Property, including the subordination of the rights of any mortgagees, lessees, sublessees, successors and assigns as may be necessary to assure the Grantee its rights under this Easement are and remain free and clear of all liens, exceptions, encumbrances or other interests affecting the rights of the Grantee under this easement, except as expressly approved by Grantee in writing.

 9. Burden and Benefit.

 The easements granted under this Easement run with the land and the rights, duties, covenants, restrictions, agreements, limitations and obligations herein created shall constitute covenants running with the land and burden the Property, and all such easements, covenants, restrictions, agreements, limitations and obligations contained herein shall be binding upon the successors in interest and assigns of the Grantor.

 Grantor further agrees that with respect to the Facility it shall not engage in, nor permit, any act or practice that would be prohibited by any such law, regulation, rule or ordinance but for the existence of any present or future exemption therein, or other limit on the effect thereof, that is based on the type of organization, character, mission or beliefs of Grantor or of any lessee or sublessee of the Facility.

 11. Damage or Destruction

 12. Liquidated Damages

 12.1 The parties understand and agree that the City's ability to obtain value from the Easement granted is conditioned upon the development and construction of the Property and the completion, opening and availability for use and occupancy of the Facility. From the nature of this Easement, it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages sustained as a result of the failure of the Grantor to complete or make available the Facility, or from use of the Property for purposes contrary to the terms of the Easement. As a result, the parties agree that the City shall have the right to recover, at its option, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth herein, which amounts the parties agree are a reasonable estimate of the damage to the City, and are intended to fairly measure the loss to the City and not to be punitive in nature.

 12.2 In the event that the Grantor fails to complete renovation and expansion of the Facility or otherwise fails to cause the Use Period to commence by January 1, 2009, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), or the amount equal to the total of any purchase money already paid by the City under the Purchase Agreement, whichever is less, and in either case plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date of the purchase of the Easement until the date of payment at the rate applied during the same period of time to the participating funds of the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of the City of Seattle.

 12.3 Additionally, in the event of Default after the beginning of the Use Period and prior to the expiration of the Use Period, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the Thirty-Five Thousand Seven Hundred Dollars ($35,700) for each year remaining on the Use Period (prorated for any Partial Use Year based upon the number of free uses not yet used in that year) plus interest on that amount, accrued as described in Section 12.2.

 12.4 After the City's demand for and receipt in full of liquidated damages in cleared funds, the City shall, within a reasonable time, record an instrument terminating this Easement.

 12.5 The City may, at its option, set off any liquidated damages under this Section against any amount otherwise payable or distributable by the City to Grantor, whether or not in relation to this Easement or the Property.

 13. Compliance with Law

 Grantor shall comply at its sole expense with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, Municipal Code, and ordinances of The City of Seattle; and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of their administrative agencies and the officers thereof.

 14. Applicable Law; Venue

 This Easement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in the Superior Court for King County.

 15. Duration; Termination. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall be in effect from the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the end of the Use Period or (b) the date that the City shall execute and record in the real property records of King County an instrument expressly terminating this Easement. If the Use Period shall not commence, all the terms hereof shall be in effect in perpetuity, unless and until the City shall record such an instrument of termination.
