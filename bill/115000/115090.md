 WHEREAS, RCW Ch. 35.86 and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 18.24 authorize the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to operate "for fee" parking; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation seeks to utilize fee parking in order to promote turnover of parked vehicles in heavily- used parking areas, and to discourage non-park uses of such parking areas; and

 WHEREAS, fee parking has been found to discourage long-term use of otherwise free parking opportunities such as those that exist in many of Seattle's Parks and Recreation parking facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation seeks to establish a pilot program to charge fees to park users for parking in four regional parks in 2005 to improve parking turnover, generate fees to pay for parking enforcement, and help defray the costs associated with use of such regional parks; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive will re-evaluate the pilot program as part of the 2006 budget process;
