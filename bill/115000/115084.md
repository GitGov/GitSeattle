 C. The fees for the following special hazards permits are established in Schedule C. See Table 22.602.045C.

 Special Hazards Permits.

 Fees for special hazards permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.045 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number," as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 that is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

 QUANTITY RANGE SOLIDS LIQUIDS GASES NUMBER (Pounds) (Gallons) (Cu. Ft.)

 1 0-550 0-55 0-1,000

 1.25 >550 - 5,500 >55 - 550 >1,000 - 5,000

 1.5 >5,500 - 27,500 >550 - 2,750 >5,000 - 50,000

 1.75 >27,500 - 55,000 >2,750 - 5,500 >50,000 - 100,000

 2 >55,000 >5,500 >100,000

 b. "Assigned Risk Factor," as established below, is a number between 1 and 1.5 assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category and the potential nature of controls required by the Fire Code.

 Hazard Class Assigned Hazard Class Assigned Risk Risk Factor Factor

 Aerosol products 1.3 Liquid petroleum gas 1.4

 Cellulose nitrate 1.3 Magnesium 1.3

 Combustible fiber 1.2 Organic peroxides

 Combustible liquids Unclassified 1.5

 Class II 1.2 Class I 1.4

 Class III-A 1.1 Class II 1.3

 Class III-B 1.0 Class III 1.2

 Compressed gases Class IV 1.0

 Highly toxic 1.5 Oxidizers

 Pyrophoric 1.4 Class 4 1.5

 Flammable 1.4 Class 3 1.4

 Unstable 1.4 Class 2 1.2

 Oxidizing 1.4 Class 1 1.1

 Toxic 1.3 Pyrophoric liquids and 1.3 solids

 Corrosive 1.3 Toxic liquids and 1.2 solids

 Corrosive Liquids and 1.1 Unstable (reactive) Solids liquids and solids

 Cryogenic Fluids 1.3 Class 4 1.5

 Explosives 1.5 Class 3 1.4

 Fireworks 1.4 Class 2 1.3

 Flammable liquids, 1.4 Class 1 1.0 Class I

 Flammable solids 1.3 Water-reactive materials

 Highly toxic liquids 1.5 Class 3 1.5 and solids

 Class 2 1.3

 Class 1 1.0

 c. "Fixed permit cost" is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit. The fixed permit cost is One hundred Fifty-two Dollars ($152.00).

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost divided by 1.1 and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [( (Q1)(R1) + (Q2)(R2) . . ..] [F/1.1]

 Where: Q = The quantity range number.

 R = The assigned risk factor.

 F = The fixed permit cost ($152.00).

 When an individual material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the hazard class that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered in the fee calculation.

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores fifty (50) gallons of gasoline and two hundred (200) gallons of 50% nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid (50%) is classified as both a corrosive liquid and a Class 2 oxidizer. Because 50% nitric acid presents two separate hazards (corrosive and Class 2 oxidizer) only the Class 2 oxidizer hazard is considered in the fee calculation because it has an assigned risk factor of 1.2 compared to the 1.1 risk factor assigned to corrosives.

 Base permit fee = [(1)(1.4)flammable + (1.25)(1.2)Class 2 oxidizer] [$152.00/1.1]

 Base permit fee = $400.73

 Schedule C

 Table 22.602.045 C Special hazards permits

 Schedule C fee worksheet-based permits originating on or after January 1, 2005 shall be renewed at one-half the permit origination fee, but not less than $152.00.

Payment for fixed rate Schedule C permit renewals, where allowed, which is received more than thirty (30) days but less than ninety-one (91) days past the permit expiration date shall be equal to 1.25 times the renewal fee. The renewal permit will be valid for only one year from the expiration date of the prior permit. Permits for which no renewal payment has been received within ninety (90) days following the permit expiration date are expired. For permits that have expired, a new permit application must be submitted and a fee of 1.5 times the fee for an original permit will be charged.

 H. After the expiration date for worksheet-based Schedule C permits, no permit is in effect until a renewal fee is paid. Payment for Schedule C worksheet-based permit fees listed under Schedule C as renewable, which is received more than thirty (30) days but less than ninety-one (91) days past the permit expiration date, shall be equal to 1.75 times the renewal amount. The renewal permit will be valid for only one year from the expiration date of the prior permit. Permits for which no renewal payment has been received within ninety (90) days following the permit expiration date are expired. For permits that have expired, a new permit application must be submitted and a fee of 1.25 times the fee for an original permit will be charged.

 I. Unless specifically stated on the permit, no temporary use permit shall be valid for a term exceeding twelve (12) months.

 J. Each examination fee listed under Schedule D shall include one (1) test and one (1) re-test.
