 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE establishing a merit evaluation process related to the confirmation of candidates to fill judicial vacancies occurring in Seattle Municipal Court.

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.20.150 states that any vacancy in the municipal court due to a death, disability or resignation of a municipal court judge shall be filled by the mayor, to serve out the unexpired term; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.20.150 further requires that any such appointment be subject to confirmation by the legislative body of the city; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council wishes to confirm individuals of the highest quality, and who possess the requisite skills and temperament for their judicial positions; and

 WHEREAS, the Council believes that this is best accomplished if the confirmation process is open and fair, and Council decisions are fully informed; and

 WHEREAS, the Council believes that independent candidate evaluations undertaken by established bar association groups will provide valuable information to help inform the Council's confirmation decisions;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. There is hereby established a merit evaluation process to help inform the City Council's confirmation decisions under RCW 35.20.150 concerning Seattle Municipal Court judicial vacancies.

 Section 2. The evaluation process shall operate as follows:

 A. The City Clerk shall advertise all existing or anticipated judicial vacancies. These advertisements shall be placed twice in the official city newspaper and twice in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The City Clerk also shall send written notice of existing or anticipated vacancies to the King County Bar Association (KCBA), Washington Women Lawyers, Latina/Latino Bar Association, Loren Miller Bar Association, National Conference of Black Lawyers (Northwest Chapter), Asian Law Association, and any other person or organization that has informed the City Clerk in writing that it wishes to receive this notice. Written notice under this Subsection 2 A may be transmitted electronically.

 B. All individuals who advise the Mayor that they wish to be considered for appointment and confirmation for municipal court judicial positions may also submit their names to the bar associations listed in Subsection A of this Section 2. These bar associations are hereby invited to review and evaluate the candidates.

 C. Any other bar association group with an established judicial candidate evaluation procedure also is invited to review and evaluate the candidates. A bar association group shall mean a formally- organized association of Washington lawyers. A group with an established judicial candidate evaluation procedure shall mean a bar association group:

 (1) With an evaluation process open to any candidate,

 (2) That has written by-laws governing its evaluation process,

 (3) That has written criteria upon which the candidates are to be judged, which

 shall be made available to the public, the Council and candidates, and

 (4) That has been actively evaluating judicial candidates for at least two years.

 D. KCBA is hereby requested to provide to the Mayor and the Council the names of those candidates receiving the highest ratings in the KCBA evaluation process. The list shall contain no fewer than three names. Other bar association groups that have evaluated candidates are hereby requested to provide to KCBA a list of the names of candidates given their highest ratings. KCBA is requested to compile the lists and forward them to the Mayor and to the Council.

 E. The Mayor is hereby invited to review and utilize the evaluations in determining which candidates to consider and appoint for municipal court judicial positions.

 F. The Council intends to review and refer to the timely evaluations it receives, and consider them along with other factors in making its confirmation decisions under RCW 35.20.150. If the Mayor appoints a person not named in the lists referred to in Subsection D of this Section 2, the Council may at its discretion inquire further of the groups that have evaluated the candidates to determine whether the Mayor's appointee was evaluated, and if so, what ratings that person received.

 Section 3. In the event that the KCBA is not able or willing to perform its function under this ordinance, it is the Council's intention, if the Mayor does not do so, to appoint a judicial evaluation committee to evaluate and rate candidates, and to invite KCBA, the listed bar associations, and other interested parties to provide recommendations concerning the committee's membership.

 Section 4. The merit evaluation process created by this Ordinance shall apply to all municipal court judicial vacancies for which the Mayor has not, as of the effective date of this Ordinance, transmitted to the Council papers formally requesting confirmation of an appointee.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2004, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2004.
