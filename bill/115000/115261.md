Notes for Default Table 10-5B(2)  1. It is acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10-5B(2) for all concrete and masonry walls, provided that the grouting is equal to or less than that specified.

 - For ungrouted walls, use the partially-grouted column.

 - For metal studs and z-furring, use the continuous-metal-framing category.

 - For discontinuous metal clips 1 inch square or smaller, use the metal-clip category.

 - For insulation that is attached without any framing members (e.g. glued), use the continuous-insulation-uninterrupted-by-framing category. Continuous insulation may be installed on the interior or exterior of masonry walls, or between stand-alone walls in multi-layer masonry walls, or on the interior or exterior of the concrete.

 2. For Table 10-5B(2), the U-factor includes R-0.17 for exterior air film and R-0.68 for interior air film - vertical surfaces. For insulated walls, the U-factor also includes R-0.45 for 0.5 in. gypsum board. U-factors are provided for the following configurations:

 a) Concrete wall: 8-in. normal weight concrete wall with a density of 145 lb/ft3.

 (b) Solid grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 and solid grouted cores.

 (c) Partially grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 having reinforcing steel every 32 in. vertically and every 48 in. horizontally, with cores grouted in those areas only. Other cores are filled with insulating material only if there is no other insulation.

 3. For walls with insulation contained in a framing layer, the U- factors in Table 10-5B(2) assume contact (and thermal bridging) between the mass wall and other framing. For wall assemblies with multiple layers where the wood or metal framing layer does not contact the concrete or masonry layer (i.e. walls with an airspace between the stud wall layer and the mass wall layer), it is acceptable to use the appropriate wood or metal frame wall default U-factors in Tables 10-5 or 10-5A. Note, it is acceptable to use this approach where the insulation extends beyond the framing and is in contact with the mass wall layer (e.g. a nominal four-inch metal stud containing insulation that is nominally six inches thick and therefore extends two inches beyond the back of the metal stud).

 4. Except for wall assemblies qualifying for note 3, if not taken from Table 10-5B(2), mass wall U-factors shall be determined in accordance with ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Appendix A, Section A3.1 and Tables A-5 to A-8, or Section A9.4. If not taken from Table 10-9, heat capacity for mass walls shall be taken from ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Appendix A, Table A-6 or A-7.

 Section 5. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1132.2 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1132.2 Building Mechanical Systems: Those parts of systems which are altered or replaced shall comply with Chapter 14 of this Code.

 Section 7. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1133 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1133 Change of Occupancy or Use: Changes of occupancy or use shall comply with the following requirements:

 a. Any unconditioned space that is altered to become semi-heated, cooled, or fully heated, or any semi-heated space that is altered to become cooled or fully heated space shall be required to be brought into full compliance with this Code. For spaces constructed prior to this Code, the installed heating output capacity shall not exceed 16 Btu/h per square foot unless the building envelope complies with the requirements of Chapter 13. Existing warehouses and repair shops are considered unconditioned space unless they are indicated as conditioned space in DPD records or they were built after 1980 and they comply with the building envelope requirements for conditioned space in effect at the time of construction. (See the Seattle Mechanical Code for requirements for combustion appliances.)

 b. Any Group R occupancy which is converted to other than a Group R occupancy shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of Sections 1130 through 1132 of this Code.

 Section 8. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1144 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1144 Violations and Penalties~~:It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm, or corporation to erect or construct any building, or remodel or rehabilitate any existing building or structure in the state, or allow the same to be done, contrary to any of the provisions of this Code.~~

 Section 9, Effective July 1, 2005, the Energy Code is amended by adding new Sections 1144.1, 1144.2, 1144.3, 1144.4, 1144.5, 1144.6, and 1144.7 to read as follows:

 1144.1 Violations: It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, occupy, inspect or maintain any building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code.

 It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm or corporation to knowingly aid, abet, counsel, encourage, hire, commend, induce or otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with this Code.

 It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm, or corporation to use any material or to install any device, appliance or equipment which does not comply with the applicable standards of this Code or which has not been approved by the building official.

 1144.2 Notice of Violation: If after investigation the building official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner or other responsible person by regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of such person. In addition, a copy of the notice may be posted at a conspicuous place on the property. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the building official. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Sections 102, 103 or 104 of the Seattle Building Code, and nothing in this section shall be deemed to obligate or require the building official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in this section.

 1144.3 Civil Penalties: Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by notice of violation. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 1144.4 Criminal Penalty: Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil penalty provision outlined in this code. Each day any person, firm or corporation shall continue to violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter and each occurrence of a prohibited activity shall constitute a separate offense.

 1144.5 Additional Relief: The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition which constitutes a violation of this code when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance. In any such action, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or will exist; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists or will exist.

 1144.6 Notices: It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice issued or posted by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice issued or posted by the building official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 The building official may record with the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notification that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

 1144.7 Review by the Director

 1144.7.1. Any person affected by a notice of violation issued by the Director pursuant to Section 1144.2 may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review in writing within ten days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day. Upon receipt of a request, the Director shall notify the person requesting the review of the date, time, and place of the Director's review. The review shall be not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the request is received, unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review. Any person affected by the notice of violation may submit any written material to the Director on or before the date of the review.

 1144.7.2. The review will consist of an informal review meeting held at the Department. A representative of the Director who is familiar with the case and the applicable regulations will attend. The Director's representative will consider any information presented by the persons attending and in the Department's enforcement file. At or after the review, the Director shall issue an order of the Director that may:

 1. Sustain the notice of violation; or

 2. Withdraw the notice of violation; or

 3. Continue the review to a future date; or

 4. Amend the notice of violation.

 1144.7.3. The Director shall issue an order of the Director within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the review. The Director shall mail the order by regular first-class mail to the person or persons named in the notice of violation.

 Section 10. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1150 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1150 Conflicts with Other Codes: In case of conflicts among Codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) and this Code, the first named Code shall govern. The duct insulation requirements in this Code or a local jurisdiction's energy code, whichever is more stringent, supersede the requirements in the Mechanical Code.

Additional efficiency standards for electrical energy use may also appear in Seattle City Light service requirements, which should be consulted.

 Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

 Section 11. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1161 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1161 Severability: If any provision of this Code or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Code or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

The legislative body hereby declares that it would have passed this Code, and each section, subsection, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, and phrases be declared unconstitutional.

 Section 12. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1162 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1162 Liability: Nothing contained in this Code is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of ~~any city or county~~the City or its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a building to conform to the provisions of this Code, or by reason of or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission of approval authorized or issued or done in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this Code, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of the City related in any manner to the enforcement of this Code or by its officers or agents. The building official or any employee charged with the enforcement of this Code, acting in good faith and without malice for the City in the discharge of his/her duties, shall not thereby render himself/herself liable personally and he/she is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or by reason of any act or omission in the discharge of his/her duties.

 Section 13. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1301 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1301 Scope: Conditioned buildings or portions thereof shall be constructed to provide the required thermal performance of the various components according to the requirements of this chapter. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, all spaces shall be assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 EXCEPTIONS:

5. Parking lot attendant booths no larger than 100 square feet, provided that the roof insulation is R-21 minimum and the wall insulation is R-13 minimum, unless otherwise allowed by Section 1310.

 Section 14. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1310 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1310 General Requirements. The building envelope shall comply with Sections 1311 through 1314.

~~1310.1 Conditioned Spaces:~~ The building envelope for all conditioned spaces (as defined in Chapter 2) shall also comply with one of the following paths:

 a. Prescriptive Building Envelope Option Sections 1320 through 1323.

 b. Component Performance Building Envelope Option Sections 1330 through 1334.

 c. Systems Analysis. See Section 1141.4.

EXCEPTION: For semi-heated spaces heated by other fuels only, wall insulation is not required for those walls that separate semi-heated spaces (see definition in Section 201.1) from the exterior provided that the space is heated solely by a heating system controlled by a thermostat with a maximum setpoint capacity of 45 degrees F, mounted no lower than the heating unit.

~~1310.2 Semi-Heated Spaces: All spaces shall be considered conditioned spaces, and shall comply with the requirements in Section 1310.1 unless they meet the following criteria for semi-heated spaces. The installed heating equipment output, in Climate Zone 1, shall be 3 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 8 Btu/(h ( ft2) and in Climate Zone 2, shall be 5 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 12 Btu/(h ( ft2). Heating shall be controlled by a thermostat mounted not lower than the heating unit and capable of preventing heating above 44 degrees space temperature. For semi-heated spaces, the only prescriptive, component performance or systems analysis building envelope requirement shall be that:~~Climate Zone 1

 a. U-0.10 maximum for the roof assembly or

 b. continuous R-9 insulation installed entirely outside of the roof structure, or

 c. R-11 insulation installed inside or within a wood roof structure, or

 d. R-19 insulation installed inside or within a metal roof structure.

 Climate Zone 2

 a. U=0.07 maximum for the roof assembly, or

 b. continuous R-14 insulation installed entirely outside of the roof structure, or

 c. R-19 insulation installed inside or within a wood roof structure, or

 d. R-25 insulation installed inside or within a metal roof structure.

 Section 15. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1311.6 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1311.6 Radiant Floors (on or below grade): Slab on grade insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab a minimum distance of 36 inches or downward to the top of the footing and horizontal for an aggregate of not less that 36 inches.

~~If required by the building official where soil conditions warrant such insulation,~~~~t~~The entire area of radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the soil. Where a soil gas control system is provided below the radiant floor, which results in increased convective flow below the radiant floor, the radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the sub-floor gravel layer.

 Section 16. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1312.2 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1312.2 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and ~~Shading Coefficient~~Visible Transmittance: Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)and Visible Transmittance (VT), shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Standard by a certified, independent agency, licensed by the NFRC.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1.Shading coefficients (SC) or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with solar heat gain coefficient requirements. Shading coefficients or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass for glazing shall be taken from Chapter 30 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's ~~test~~datausing a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

2. For the purposes of 1323, Exception 1, visible transmittance for the center of the glazing assembly shall be taken from Chapter 30 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

Note that using the exception for the SHGC for the center-of- glass does not give the full credit for the overall product (including the frame) that the NFRC-certified SHGC does. Though the SHGC for the frame is not zero (the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals indicates that the SHGC can range from 0.11-0.14 for metal frames and from 0.02-0.07 for wood/vinyl/fiberglass frames), the SHGC for the frame is invariable lower than that for the glass. Consequently, an NFRC- certified SHGC will generally be lower.

Conversely, the VT for the center-of-glass overstates the VT for the overall product (including the frame). The VT for the frame is zero. Consequently, an NFRC-certified VT will always be lower. For this reason, Exception 2 to Section 1312.2 is only applicable to Exception 1 in Section 1323. It is not applicable to other sections.

 Section 17. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1322 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1322 Opaque Envelope: Roof/ceilings, opaque exterior walls, opaque doors, floors over unconditioned space, below grade walls, slab on grade floors, and radiant floors enclosing conditioned spaces shall be insulated according to Section 1311 and Tables 13-1or 13-2. Compliance with nominal R-values shall be demonstrated for the thermal resistance of the added insulation in framing cavities and/or insulated sheathing only.

 (1) design outside airflow is greater than 3,000 cfm, and

 (2) design occupancy averaged over all of the spaces served by the system is greater than 100 people per 1,000 ft2 of floor area.

 The demand ventilation control system shall have CO2 sensors installed in each room where the design occupancy is greater than 40 people per 1,000 ft2 of floor area for single-zone systems and where the design occupancy is greater than 100 people per 1,000 ft2 of floor area for multiple-zone systems. The CO2 sensors shall be located between one foot and six feet above the floor. Ventilation controls shall be in compliance with ASHRAE Standard 62 and the Seattle Mechanical Code.

 Section 32. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1413.1 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1413.1 Operation: Air economizers shall be capable of automatically modulating outside and return air dampers to provide 100% of the design supply air as outside air to reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling. Air economizers shall be used for RS- 29 analysis base case for all systems without exceptions in Sections 1413, 1423, or 1433. Water economizers shall be capable of providing the total concurrent cooling load served by the connected terminal equipment lacking airside economizer, at outside air temperatures of 45(F dry-bulb/40(F wet-bulb and below. For this calculation, all factors including solar and internal load shall be the same as those used for peak load calculations, except for the outside temperatures.

~~EXCEPTION: Water economizers using air-cooled heat rejection equipment may use a 35(F dry-bulb outside air temperature for this calculation. This exception is limited to a maximum of 20 tons per building.~~

 Section 34. Effective July 1, 2005, the Energy Code is amended by adding a new Section 1413.5 to read as follows:

 1413.5 Economizer Heating System Impact: Any HVAC system that increases the building heating energy use during economizer operation is not allowed (e.g. single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems).

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Where the heating is allowed by Section 1435.

 2. Water source heat pump systems that comply with Section 1433, Exception 2.

 Note that single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems do not comply with this requirement. This is because economizer operation lowers the temperature of the air entering the hot deck heating coil, increasing its energy use. In order to use this type of system, a water economizer must be used, or the system must meet one of the economizer exceptions and have neither type of economizer. (Another resolution is to use a dual-fan/dual-duct system where the hot deck fan supplies only return air or return air plus minimum ventilation air.)

 This requirement will not affect three-deck multizone since they cannot work with an air economizer in any case (it would make the neutral deck a cold deck).

 An exception to the heating impact is provided for economizers on VAV systems that cause zone level heating to increase due to a reduction in supply air temperature. Reducing supply air temperatures on a cooling-VAV system will reduce fan energy (particularly if the system has a variable speed drive), offsetting the energy lost due to increased reheat energy.

 See the discussion and diagrams of Section 6.3.1.4 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001 in the Users Manual.

 Section 35. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1414.1 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 2. Static pressure: ~~2~~1/2 inches to 3 inches; seal all transverse joints and longitudinal seams.Spiral lock seams in round and flat oval ductwork do not require sealing, however, other seams shall be sealed.

 3. Static pressure: above 3 inches; seal all transverse joints, longitudinal seams and duct wall penetrations.

~~Duct tape and other pressure sensitive tape shall not be used as the primary sealant where ducts are designed to operate at static pressures of 1 inch W.C. or greater.~~

All low-pressure supply and return air systems not located entirely within the conditioned space, including the unconditioned side of enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air, shall be securely fastened and sealed. Ductwork shall be sealed using welds, gaskets, mastic, or mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape. Enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air shall be sealed using mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape or, when drywall is used to enclose the air system, drywall mud and tape. Duct tape is not permitted as a sealant on any ducts.

EXCEPTION: Fibrous glass duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181A and flexible duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181B may use tapes listed for these systems.

Note that longitudinal seams are joints oriented in the direction of airflow. Transverse joints are connections of two duct sections oriented perpendicular to airflow.

 Section 42. Effective July 1, 2005, Section 1432.2 of the 2004 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1432.2 Systems Temperature Reset Controls

 1432.2.1 Air Systems for Multiple Zones: Systems supplying heated or cooled air to multiple zones shall include controls which automatically reset supply air temperatures by representative building loads or by outside air temperature. Temperature shall be reset by at least 25% of the design supply-air-to-room-air temperature difference.

 EXCEPTION: Where specified humidity levels are required to satisfy process needs, such as computer rooms or museums.

 1432.2.2 Hydronic Systems: Systems with a design capacity of ~~600,000~~300,000 Btu/h or greater supplying heated or mechanically refrigerated water ~~(to comfort conditioning systems)~~ shall include controls which automatically reset supply water temperatures by representative building loads (including return water temperature) or by outside air temperature.

 To limit the heat loss from the heat rejection device (cooling tower), for hydronic heat pumps connected to a common heat pump water loop with central devices for heat rejection (e.g., cooling tower),

 a. If a closed-circuit tower (fluid cooler) is used, either an automatic valve shall be installed to bypass all but a minimal flow of water around the tower (for freeze protection), or low leakage positive closure dampers shall be provided.

 b. If an open-circuit tower is used directly in the heat pump loop, an automatic valve shall be installed to bypass all heat pump water flow around the tower.

 c. If an open-circuit tower is used in conjunction with a separate heat exchanger to isolate the tower from the heat pump loop, then heat loss shall be controlled by shutting down the circulation pump on the cooling tower loop.

 For hydronic heat pumps connected to a common heat pump water loop with central devices for heat rejection (e.g., cooling tower) and having a total pump system power exceeding 10 hp, each hydronic heat pump shall have

 a. a two-position two-way (but not three-way) valve, or

 b. a variable head pressure two-way (water regulating) control valve or pump.

 For the purposes of this section, pump system power is the sum of the nominal power demand (i.e. nameplate horsepower at nominal motor efficiency) of motors of all pumps that are required to operate at design conditions to supply fluid from the heating or cooling source to all heat transfer devices (e.g., coils, heat exchanger) and return it to the source. This converts the system into a variable flow system and, as such, the primary circulation pumps shall comply with the variable flow requirements in Section 1438.

For daylight zones under overhead glazing that exceed 5,000 square feet, there must be at least two independent photocontrol systems with each system having a dedicated photosensor.

 EXCEPTION: Daylight spaces enclosed by walls or ceiling height partitions and containing 2 or fewer lighting fixtures are not required to have a separate switch for general area lighting.

1513.3.2 Automatic Control: Daylight zones shall have controls which automatically reduce lighting power in response to available daylight by either:  a. a combination of dimming ballasts and daylight-sensing automatic controls, which are capable of dimming the lights continuously, or

 b. a combination of stepped switching and daylight-sensing automatic controls, which are capable of incrementally reducing the light level in steps automatically and turning the lights off automatically.

i. Single-lamp luminaire systems shall have three levels of automatic control: all lamps on, approximately half of the luminaires turned off in a relatively uniform pattern, and then all of the luminaires off. As an alternate, where the daylight zone contains two rows of luminaires and they are parallel to a window, three levels of automatic control may also be achieved by having both rows on, the row closest to the window off and the other row on, and both rows off. For rooms, such as small offices, which contain only a single one-lamp luminaire, it is acceptable for the daylighting control system to automatically switch off the entire luminaire.

ii. Two-lamp luminaires shall have three levels of automatic control: both lamps on, one lamp on and one lamp off, and both lamps off. As an alternate, where the daylight zone contains two rows of luminaires and they are parallel to a window, three levels of automatic control may also be achieved by having both rows on, the row closest to the window off and the other row on, and both rows off. For rooms, such as small offices, which contain only a single two-lamp luminaire, it is acceptable for the daylighting control system to automatically switch off the entire luminaire rather than switching off one lamp, then both lamps.

iii. Three-lamp luminaires shall have four levels of automatic control: all three lamps on, two lamps on and one lamp off, one lamp on and two lamps off, and all three lamps off.

iv. For other multi-lamp luminaries with four or more lamps, the number of required incremental steps shall be equal to one plus the number of lamps in the luminaire.  Any switching devices installed to override the automatic daylighting control shall comply with the criteria in Section 1513.6.2a-e.

EXCEPTIONS: 1. The following are exempt from the requirements for automatic daylighting controls in Section 1513.3.2:  a. retail spaces adjacent to vertical glazing (retail spaces under overhead glazing are not exempt),

 b. lighting exempted by Section 1512, and

 c. display, exhibition, and specialty lighting complying with Section 1513.4.

 2. The following spaces are exempt from the requirements for automatic daylighting controls in Section 1513.3.2 provided that they have occupancy sensor controls that comply with Section 1513.6.1:

 a. small spaces in the daylight zone that are normally unoccupied (such as a storage room with a window, or restrooms),

 b. rooms less than 300 square feet, and

 c. conference rooms 300 square feet and larger that have a lighting control system with at least four scene options.

 3. HID lamps with automatic controls that are capable of reducing the power consumption by at least 50% in lieu of continuous dimming controls in 1513.3.2.

 4. HID lamps 150 watts or less are exempt from the dimming requirements in 1513.3.2.

 The lighting allowance for covered parking shall be 0.20 W/ft2, and the allowance for open parking and outdoor areas shall be ~~0.20~~0.15 W/ft2. For open parking and outdoor areas and roadways, luminaires mounted above 15 feet shall meet IESNA requirements for Full Cutoff Luminaires. (Full Cutoff means a luminaire light distribution where zero candela intensity occurs at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and all greater angles from nadir.)

 The lighting allowance for building exteriors and externally-illuminated signs (including billboards)shall be calculated either by multiplying the building facade area that is illuminated or sign area by ~~0.25~~0.15 W/ft2 or multiplying the building perimeter in feet by 7.5 watts per lineal foot. Any building exterior lighting that exceeds 7.5 watts per lineal foot of total building perimeter is not allowed to be traded with other lighting areas.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Group U occupancy accessory to Group R-3 or R-4 occupancy.

 2. ~~For covered parking, 0.30 W/ft2 may be used for the lighting provided that the ceilings and walls are painted or stained with a reflectance value of 0.70 or higher.~~Reserved.

3. The top level of a parking garage is allowed to be included with the covered parking garage category provided that the luminaires on the top level meet IESNA requirements for Full Cutoff Luminaires.

4. For the gas station pump area under canopy only, 1.00 W/ft2 may be used. For automobile sales area only, and for other exterior retail sales, including but not limited to gardening supplies, 0.50 W/ft2 may be used.
