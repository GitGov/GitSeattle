 N/A

 THIS INSTRUMENT is executed this date in favor of the City of Seattle, a municipal corporation (herein "City"), by the National Office Partners Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("NOP").

 WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, NOP is vested in fee simple title in the real property situated in King County, Washington, described on Exhibit 1 hereto (herein called the "Property"); and

 WHEREAS, NOP applied for and received approval of a Master Use Permit (Project No. 9703782 ) to develop an office building project (the "Project") on the above-described property, and thereafter developed such Project; and

 WHEREAS, the Project necessitated the vacation of the alley in Block 21 of C.D. Boren's Addition to the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, NOP filed a petition (C. F. _302209_______) for the vacation of the above-referenced alley pursuant to Chapter 35.79 of the Revised Code of Washington and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.62; and

 WHEREAS, the Transportation Committee of the Seattle City Council held a public hearing on the street vacation petition on _September 15, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, the Transportation Committee of the Seattle City Council subsequently discussed the project in a public meeting; and

 WHEREAS, the Transportation Committee of the Seattle City Council recommended approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions on _September 15, 1998__________; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council granted approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions on September 21, 1998______________; and

 WHEREAS, execution of a Property Use and Development Agreement is desired to ensure compliance with any conditions of alley vacation approval that will not be fully satisfied prior to passage of the ordinance vacating the above-referenced alley;

 NOW, THEREFORE, NOP hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, that if the ordinance vacating the above-referenced alley is passed by the Seattle City Council and approved by the Mayor, NOP shall operate and maintain the Project in accordance with this Property Use and Development Agreement:

 Section 1. Addressed below are those conditions of the alley vacation approval that require on-going effort during the operation of the Project, and could not, therefore, be met prior to passage of the ordinance vacating the above-referenced alley.

 A. Hillclimb Route. The hillclimb route through the Project shall be maintained open to the public from 7 a.m. until 7 pm each business day, except for such reasonable closures as may be required for maintenance, repair, security purposes, or for reasons beyond NOP's control. NOP may increase the hours that the hillclimb route is open without prior City approval. The "hillclimb route" is the pedestrian route (i) beginning at the Project entrances on 3rd Avenue, (ii) continuing through the 3rd Avenue atrium, (iii) up the stairs and escalators connecting to the atrium, (iv) through the 4th Avenue lobby, and (v) exiting the Project entrances on 4th Avenue. NOP may adopt such reasonable rules and regulations regarding the use of and access to the hillclimb route as are necessary to ensure the safety or security of the public, the Project or the Property.

 B. Pedestrian Amenities: The Project will include (i) in its lobby areas on 3rd Avenue, in what is considered the Atrium space, and 4th Avenue, on both sides of the main entrance (in areas not otherwise used for Project purposes, such as retail spaces and security desks), seating areas for the general public, including tables and chairs in the quantity as provided and documented through digital photos in June of 2004; (ii) building-standard directional signage for pedestrians at the 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue building entrances and at locations on the hillclimb route; and (iii) seasonal landscaping within the 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue lobby areas. These fixtures and furniture may be replaced, updated or modified (but not reduced in quantity or eliminated altogether) by NOP from time to time without City approval, provided that prior City approval shall be required for modification of signage. NOP may increase the amount of public seating in the future without prior City approval.

 Section 2. The legal description of the property upon which the Property is located (the "Property") is included in Exhibit 1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by this reference. An executed copy of this Property Use and Development Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County and the covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property.

 Section 3. This Property Use and Development Agreement may be amended or modified by mutual agreement between the City and NOP, according to the following procedure. Minor changes to this Agreement may be approved by SDOT, if the proposed change is consistent with the purpose and intent of the conditions. Any major changes to this Agreement, as determined by SDOT, shall require approval by the City Council of the City by resolution or ordinance. SDOT shall provide NOP with notice and the opportunity to comment on whether a change is considered minor or major, prior to SDOT making that determination. Nothing in this Property Use and Development Agreement shall be construed as a surrender of the City's governmental powers.

 Section 4. This Property Use and Development Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and the public. The City may institute and prosecute any proceeding law or in equity to enforce this Property Use and Development Agreement.

 Section 5. It is further expressly agreed that in the event any covenant or condition or restriction in this instrument or any portion thereof is invalid or void, such invalidity or voidness shall in no way affect any other covenant, condition or restriction.
