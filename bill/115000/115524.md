 (2) The lot contains a Landmark structure and satisfies all conditions to the transfer of Landmark TDR from such lot under this chapter and the Public Benefit Features Rule, other than conditions related to the availability of unused base floor area.

In certain zones, as specified in this section, the maximum structure height may be allowed only for particular uses or only on specified conditions, or both.  2. Except in the PMM zone, the base height limit for a structure is the lowest of the maximum structure height or the lowest other height limit, if any, that applies pursuant to the provisions of this title based upon the uses in the structure, before giving effect to any bonus for which the structure qualifies under this chapter and to any special exceptions or departures authorized under this chapter. In the PMM zone the base height limit is the maximum height permitted pursuant to urban renewal covenants.

 3. In zones listed below in this subsection A3 there is a base height limit for portions of a structure containing nonresidential and live-work uses, which is shown as the first figure after the zone designation (except that there is no such limit in DOC1), and a base height limit that applies to portions of a structure in residential use, shown as the figure following the "/". The third figure shown is the highest possible applicable height limit for a structure that uses the bonus available under 23.49.015 and has no nonresidential or live-work use above the first height limit shown for that zone:

~~b~~ii. When at least twenty-five (25) percent of the gross floor area of all structures on a lot is in residential use; or

~~c~~iii. When a minimum of 1.5 FAR of retail sales and service or entertainment uses, or any combination thereof, is provided on the lot~~; or~~.

~~d~~b. For residential floor area created by infill of a light well on a Landmark structure, the base height limit is the lesser of 150 feet or the highest level at which the light well is enclosed by the full length of walls of the structure on at least three sides. For the purpose of this subsection a light well is defined as an inward modulation on a non- street facing facade that is enclosed on at least three sides by walls of the same structure, and infill is defined as an addition to that structure within the light well. ~~The maximum height allowed under this subsection A3d shall be the lesser of one hundred fifty (150) feet or the highest level at which the light well is enclosed by the full length of walls of the structure on at least three sides.~~

If a structure on the lot is a Landmark structure, approval by the Landmarks Preservation Board for any proposed modifications to controlled features is required prior to a decision by the Director to allow or condition additional height for the project. The Landmarks Preservation Board's decision shall be incorporated into the Director's decision. Inclusion of a structure on the list below is solely for the purpose of conditioning additional height under this subsection, and shall not be interpreted in any way to prejudge the structure's merit as a Landmark:

 2. Chargeable floor area shall not exceed the applicable base FAR except as expressly authorized pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

 a. ~~In DOC1~~~~and DOC2 zones the first one (1) FAR above the base FAR may be gained, at the applicant's option, by any combination of the following: providing one of the amenity features listed in Section 23.49.013, subject to the limits and conditions in that section; providing short-term parking meeting the basic standards in the Public Benefit Features Rule, where such parking is eligible pursuant to Map 1N; providing retail sales and service or entertainment uses as street-level uses meeting the requirements of Section 23.49.025, where such uses are eligible as indicated on Map 1N; or using development rights transferred from an open space TDR site or Landmark TDR site pursuant to Section 23.49.014. An applicant using the option allowed under this subsection A2a may achieve additional chargeable floor area consistent with subsections A2d through A2g of this section~~~~.~~For new structures in DOC1, DOC2 and DMC zones allowing chargeable floor area above the base FAR, the first increment of chargeable floor area above the base FAR, shown for each zone on Chart 23.49.011 A.2, shall be gained by making a commitment satisfactory to the Director that the proposed development will earn a LEED Silver rating or a meet a substantially equivalent standard approved by the Director as a Type I decision. In these zones, no chargeable floor area above the base FAR is allowed for a project that includes chargeable floor area in a new structure unless the applicant makes such a commitment. When such a commitment is made, the provisions of SMC Section 23.49.020 shall apply. The Director may establish by rule procedures for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met any such substantially equivalent standard, provided that no rule shall assign authority for making a final determination to any person other than an officer of the Department of Planning and Development or another City agency with regulatory authority and expertise in green building practices.

 b. ~~In the DMC zone chargeable floor area above the base FAR may be achieved, at the applicant's option, by qualifying for bonuses pursuant to Section 23.49.126, Downtown Mixed Commercial, ratios for public benefit features. Such option may be exercised only by election in writing by the applicant as part of the original application for a Master Use Permit, or within sixty (60) days of the effective date of Ordinance 120443, for the project that will use such bonus. An applicant making such election shall not be granted bonus floor area for the lot pursuant to Sections 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, but may use TDR consistent with Section 23.49.014. An applicant making such election thereby also elects to have the optional exemptions under subsection B3 of this section, and not those in subsection B1, apply in determining chargeable floor area.~~In DOC1, DOC2, and DMC zones, additional chargeable floor area above the first increment of FAR that exceeds the base FAR may be obtained only by qualifying for floor area bonuses pursuant to Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or by the transfer of development rights pursuant to Section 23.49.014, or both, except as provided in subsections A2c through A2i of this section.

~~d. Except as provided in subsection A2a, A2b, and A2c of this section, additional chargeable floor area above the base FAR may be achieved only by qualifying for bonuses pursuant to Sections 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or by the transfer of development rights pursuant to Sections 23.49.014, or both, subject to the limits of this chapter and to any other applicable conditions and limitations.~~

~~e~~c. In the DOC1 zone, additional chargeable floor area over seventeen (17) FAR may be obtained only through the transfer of rural development credits, except as provided below in this subsection c. No chargeable floor area shall be allowed under this subsection unless, at the time of the Master Use Permit application for the project proposing such floor area, an agreement is in effect between the City and King County, duly authorized by City ordinance, for the implementation of a Rural Development Credits Program. If no such agreement is in effect, the chargeable floor area above the seventeenth FAR may be obtained according to the provisions of Section 23.49.011A2f.

~~e~~d. In no event shall the use of bonuses,~~or~~TDR, or rural development credits, or any combination of them, be allowed to result in chargeable floor area in excess of the maximum as set forth in Chart 23.49.011A1 , except that a structure on a lot ~~zoned both DOC1 and DMC may exceed the floor area ratio permitted in either zone, provided the chargeable floor area on the lot as a whole does not exceed the combined total permitted chargeable floor area.~~in a planned community development pursuant to Section 23.49.036 or a combined lot development pursuant to Section 23.49.041, may exceed the floor area ratio otherwise permitted on that lot, provided the chargeable floor area on all lots included in the planned community development or combined lot development as a whole does not exceed the combined total permitted chargeable floor area.~~~~~~f~~e. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection A2~~f~~e or subsections A2g or A2i of this section , not less than five (5) percent of all floor area above the base FAR to be gained on any lot, excluding any floor area gained under subsection A2a ~~or A2c~~of this Section, shall be gained through the transfer of Landmark TDR, to the extent that Landmark TDR is available.

An applicant may satisfy the minimum Landmark TDR requirement in this section by purchases from private parties, by transfer from an eligible sending lot owned by the applicant, by purchase from the City, or by any combination of the foregoing. This subsection A2e~~f~~ does not apply to any lot in a DMR zone.~~, or to any lot in a DMC zone for which an election has been made under subsection A2b of this section.~~

~~g~~f. Except as otherwise permitted under subsection A2h or A2i of this section, ~~O~~on any lot except a lot in a DMR zone ~~or a DMC zone~~~~for which an election has been made under subsection A2b of this section)~~, the total amount of chargeable floor area gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.012, together with any housing TDR and Landmark housing TDR used for the same project, shall equal seventy-five (75) percent of the amount, if any, by which the total chargeable floor area to be permitted on the lot exceeds the sum of (i) the base FAR, as determined under this section and Section 23.49.032 if applicable, plus (ii) any chargeable floor area gained on the lot pursuant to subsection A2a,~~or~~A2c, A2h, or A2i of this section. At least half of the remaining twenty-five (25) percent shall be gained by using TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, to the extent available. The balance of such 25 percent shall be gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.013 or through TDR other than housing TDR, or both, consistent with this chapter. TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering such TDR for sale, at a price per square foot not exceeding the prevailing market price for TDR other than housing TDR, as determined by the Director.

~~h~~g. In order to gain chargeable floor area on any lot in a DMR zone, an applicant may (i) use any types of TDR eligible under this chapter in any proportions, or (ii) use bonuses under Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or both, subject to the limits for particular types of bonus under Section 23.49.013, or (iii) combine such TDR and bonuses in any proportions.

h. On any lot in a DMC zone allowing a maximum FAR of seven (7), in addition to the provisions of subsection 2f above, an applicant may gain chargeable floor area above the first increment of FAR above the base FAR through use of DMC housing TDR, or any combination of DMC housing TDR with floor area gained through other TDR and bonuses as prescribed in subsection 2f.

~~i. Bonuses for street-level uses may be allowed only pursuant to subsection A2a or A2b of this section. Bonuses for short- term parking may be allowed only pursuant to subsection A2a of this section. The bonus ratio for street-level uses is three square feet of floor area granted per one square foot (3:1) of bonus feature. The bonus ratio for short-term parking is one (1) square foot of floor area granted per one (1) square foot (1:1) of bonus feature up to a maximum of two hundred (200) parking spaces for above grade parking and is two (2) square feet of floor area granted per one (1) square foot (2:1) of bonus feature for below grade parking up to a maximum of two hundred (200) parking spaces. Ratios and limits for the other features for which a bonus may be granted under subsection A2a are in Section 23.49.013.~~

i. When the amount of bonus development sought in any permit application does not exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet of chargeable floor area, the Director may permit such floor area to be achieved solely through the bonus for housing and child care.

j. Subsection A2a of this section shall expire five (5) years from the effective date of this ordinance, and thereafter that first increment of floor area above the base FAR shall be zero (0).  k. No chargeable floor area above the base FAR shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a Landmark structure, unless a Certificate of Approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

 3. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus development under this section shall include a calculation of the amount of bonus development sought and shall identify the manner in which the conditions to such bonus development shall be satisfied. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any such bonus development, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus development to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus development, which decision may include alternative means to achieve bonus development, at the applicant's option, if each alternative would be consistent with the conditions of any other conditions of the permit, including Design Review if applicable.

 Section 14. Section 23.49.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 120443, is amended as follows:

 23.49.012 Bonus floor area for voluntary agreements for housing and child care.

 A. General Provisions

 1. The purpose of this section is to ~~allow chargeable floor area above the base FAR when the applicant by voluntary agreement provides, funds or partially funds public benefit features or capital projects that mitigate a portion of the impacts of higher- density development)~~encourage development in addition to that authorized by basic zoning regulations ("bonus development"), provided that certain adverse impacts from the bonus development are mitigated. ~~The City has determined that a major impact of such development is the increased need for low income and low moderate income affordable housing downtown to serve workers in lower-paid jobs and their families attracted by the development. The general intent of this section is that voluntary agreements for bonus floor area shall mitigate impacts, with primary emphasis on housing.~~ Two impacts from such development are an increased need for low- income housing downtown to house the families of workers having lower-paid jobs and an increased need for child care for downtown workers.  2. If an applicant elects to seek approval of bonus development pursuant to this section, the applicant must execute a voluntary agreement with the City in which the applicant agrees to provide mitigation for such impacts. The mitigation may be provided by building the requisite low-income housing or child care facilities (the "performance option"), by making a contribution to be used by the City to build or provide the housing and child care facilities (the "payment option"), or by a combination of the performance and payment options.

~~2. There shall be a voluntary agreement between the applicant and the City with respect to all floor area earned pursuant to this section. The agreement commits the applicant to provide eligible bonus features ("performance option"), or to make payments to the City to fund such features ("cash option"), or a combination of both the cash option and the performance option, in amounts sufficient to qualify for the amount of floor area desired.~~

~~3. No floor area beyond the base FAR shall be granted for any project that would cause significant alteration to any designated feature of a Landmark structure, unless a Certificate of Approval is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.~~

 B. Voluntary Agreements for Housing and Child Care. For each square foot of chargeable floor area above the base FAR to be earned under this section, the voluntary agreement shall commit the developer to provide or contribute to the following facilities in the following amounts:

 1. Housing.

 a. For each square foot of bonus floor area, housing serving  each of the specified income levels, or an alternative cash contribution for housing to serve each specified income level, must be provided according to Chart 23.49.012 A.

 b. For purposes of this subsection, a housing unit serves households up to an income level only if all of the following are satisfied for a period of fifty (50) years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of ~~acceptance~~ occupancy by the ~~Director of the Office of Housing~~ Department of Planning and Development~~in accordance with subsection 23.49.012 B1i~~:

 (1) The housing unit is used as rental housing solely for households with incomes, at the time of each household's initial occupancy, not exceeding that level; and

 (2) The monthly rent charged for the housing unit, together with a reasonable allowance for any basic utilities that are not included in the rent, does not exceed one-twelfth of thirty (30) percent of that income level as adjusted for the estimated size of household corresponding to the size of unit, in such manner as the Director of the Office of Housing shall determine;

 (3) There are no charges for occupancy other than rent; and

 (4) The housing unit and the structure in which it is located are maintained in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances, for such fifty (50) year period.

 c. For purposes of this section, housing may be considered to be provided by the applicant seeking bonus floor area if it is committed to serve one or more of the income groups referred to in this section pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City executed and recorded prior to the issuance of the building permit for the construction of such housing or conversion of nonresidential space to such housing, but no earlier than three (3) years prior to the issuance of a master use permit for the project using the bonus floor area, and either:

 (1) The housing unit is newly constructed, is converted from nonresidential use, or is renovated space that was vacant as of the date of this ordinance, on the lot using the bonus floor area, pursuant to the same master use permit as the project using the bonus floor area; or

 (2) The housing is newly constructed, is converted from nonresidential use, or is renovated in a residential building that was vacant as of the date of this ordinance on a lot in a Downtown zone ~~in compliance with the Public Benefit Features Rule~~, and:

i. The housing is owned by the applicant seeking to use the bonus; or

ii. The owner of the housing has signed, and there is in effect, a linkage agreement approved by the Director of the Office of Housing allowing the use of the housing bonus in return for necessary and adequate financial support to the development of the housing, and either the applicant has, by the terms of the linkage agreement, the exclusive privilege to use the housing to satisfy conditions for bonus floor area; or the applicant is the assignee of the privilege to use the housing to satisfy conditions for bonus floor area, pursuant to a full and exclusive assignment, approved by the Director of the Office of Housing, of the linkage agreement, and all provisions of this section respecting assignments are complied with. If housing is developed in advance of a linkage agreement, payments by the applicant used to retire or reduce interim financing may be considered necessary and adequate support for the development of the housing.

 d. Housing that is not yet constructed, or is not ready for occupancy, at the time of the issuance of a building permit for the project intending to use bonus floor area, may be considered to be provided by the applicant if, within three (3) years of the issuance of the first building permit for such project, the ~~Director of the Office of Housing~~Department of Planning and Development issues a final certificate of ~~acceptance~~occupancy for such housing. Any applicant seeking to qualify for bonus floor area based on such housing shall provide to the City, prior to the date when a contribution would be due for the cash option under subsection C of this section, an irrevocable bank letter of credit or other sufficient security approved by the Director of the Office of Housing, and a related voluntary agreement, so that at the end of the three (3) year period, if the housing does not qualify or is not provided in a sufficient amount to satisfy the terms of this section, the City shall receive (i) a cash contribution for housing in the amount determined pursuant to this section after credit for any qualifying housing then provided, plus (ii) an amount equal to interest on such contribution, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted from time to time by Bank of America, or its successor, plus three (3) percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit for the project using the bonus. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any such security, the Director of the Office of Housing shall take appropriate steps to do so, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash contributions for housing made under this section. In the case of any project proposing to use bonus floor area for which no building permit is required, references to the building permit in this subsection shall mean the master use permit allowing establishment or expansion of the use for which bonus floor area is sought.

~~e. Only the party named in the linkage agreement with the owner of the housing as having the privilege to use the housing to satisfy bonus conditions may assign that privilege, and any assignment must be absolute and irrevocable. No assignment by an assignee, whether to a new party or back to the assignor or housing owner, is permitted. The Director of the Office of Housing may require, as conditions to recognizing any assignment, that:~~~~(1) The applicant obtain a written acknowledgment from the owner of the housing that the linkage agreement, as so assigned, is valid and effective;~~~~(2) The assignor execute any documents deemed necessary by the Director of the Office of Housing to ensure that no party other than the permitted assignee has used, or will have any claim to use, the same housing to qualify for any floor area or development potential of any kind under any ordinance or other provision of law; and~~~~(3) The owner and such assignor agree to indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers and employees from any claims of the type described in subsection ii above and any damages from the City's refusal to honor such claims.~~

e.~~f.~~ Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer on any owner or developer of housing, any party to a linkage agreement, or any assignee, any development rights or property interests. Because the availability and terms of allowance of bonus floor area depend upon the regulations in effect at the relevant time for the project proposing to use such bonus floor area, pursuant to SMC Section 23.76.026, any approvals or agreements by the Director of the Office of Housing regarding the eligibility of actual or proposed housing as to satisfy conditions of a bonus, and any approval of a linkage agreement and/or assignment, do not grant any vested rights, nor guarantee that any bonus floor area will be permitted based on such housing.

f.~~g.~~ The Director of the Office of Housing shall review the design and proposed management plan for any housing proposed under the performance option to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this section.

g.~~h.~~ The Director of the Office of Housing is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of housing and related agreements and instruments consistent with this section. ~~The Director of the Office of Housing is further authorized to issue a certificate of acceptance with respect to any housing units developed to satisfy the conditions of this rule when: the construction or rehabilitation of such housing units and the structure in which they are located has been completed; any necessary certificate of occupancy or final permit approval has been issued for the housing units; and either are rented consistent with this section or are vacant, ready for occupancy and offered for rent consistent with this section; and the owner of the housing provides such evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section and the Public Benefit Features Rule as the Director of the Office of Housing may require.~~

h.~~i.~~ Any provision of any Director's rule notwithstanding, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus floor area based on the provision of housing under this subsection, that the housing units shall continue to satisfy the requirements of this subsection throughout the required fifty (50) year period and that such compliance shall be documented annually to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Housing, and the owner of any project using such bonus floor area shall be in violation of this title if any such housing unit does not satisfy such requirements, or if satisfactory documentation is not provided to the Director of the Office of Housing, at any time during such period. The Director of the Office of Housing may provide by rule for circumstances in which housing units maybe replaced if lost due to casualty or other causes, and for terms and conditions upon which a cash contribution may be made in lieu of continuing to provide housing units under the terms of this subsection.

~~j. Housing units that are provided to qualify for a bonus shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the Housing Director.~~

 2. Child Care.

 a. For each square foot of bonus floor area allowed under this section, in addition to providing housing or an alternative cash contribution pursuant to subsection B1, the applicant shall provide fully improved child care facility space sufficient for 0.000127 of a child care slot, or a cash contribution to the City of Three Dollars and Twenty-five Cents ($3.25), to be administered by the Human Services Department. The Director of the Human Services Department may adjust the alternative cash contribution, no more frequently than annually, approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, or any other cost index that such Director may deem appropriate. The base year for the first such adjustment shall be 2001. The minimum interior space in the child care facility for each child care slot ~~is one hundred (100) net rentable square feet.~~shall comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing the operation of licensed childcareproviders. Child care facility space shall be deemed provided only if the applicant causes the space to be newly constructed or newly placed in child care use after the submission of a permit application for the project intended to use the bonus floor area, except as provided in subsection B2b(6). If any contribution or subsidy in any form is made by any public entity to the acquisition, development, financing or improvement of any child care facility, then any portion of the space in such facility determined by the Director of the Human Services Department to be attributable to such contribution or subsidy shall not be considered as provided by any applicant other than that public entity.

 b. Child care space shall be provided on the same lot as the project using the bonus floor area or on another lot in a downtown zone and shall be contained in a child care facility satisfying the following standards:

 (1) The child care facility and accessory exterior space must be approved for licensing by the State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services and any other applicable state or local governmental agencies responsible for the regulation of licensed childcare providers.

 (2) At least twenty (20) percent of the number of child care slots for which space is provided as a condition of bonus floor area must be reserved for, and affordable to, families with annual incomes at or below the ~~federal d~~U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Low Income Standard for Section 8 Housing based on family size (or, if such standard shall no longer be published, a standard established by the Human Services Director based generally on eighty (80) percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or division thereof, that includes Seattle, adjusted for family size). Child care slots shall be deemed to meet these conditions if they serve, and are limited to, (a) children receiving child care subsidy from the City of Seattle, King County or State Department of Social and Health Services, and/or (b) children whose families have annual incomes no higher than the above standard ~~that~~who are charged according to a sliding fee scale such that the fees paid by any family do not exceed the amount it would be charged, exclusive of subsidy, if the family were enrolled in the City of Seattle Child Care Subsidy Program.

 (3) Child care space provided to satisfy bonus conditions shall be dedicated to child care use, consistent with the terms of this section, for twenty years. The dedication shall be established by a recorded covenant, running with the land, and enforceable by the City, signed by the owner of the lot where the child care facility is located and by the owner of the lot where the bonus floor area is used, if different from the lot of the child care facility. The child care facility shall be maintained in operation, with adequate staffing, at least eleven (11) hours per day, five (5) days per week, ~~forty-eight (48)~~fifty (50) weeks per year.

 (4) ~~The minimum area of the child care facility shall be six thousand (6,000) square feet of net rentable floor area plus two thousand (2,000) square feet of exterior space suitable as recreation area accessory to the interior child care space and dedicated to such use during daytime hours on all days when the child care facility is in operation or is required to be open.~~ Exterior space for which a bonus is or has been allowed under any other section of this title or under former Title 24 shall not be eligible to satisfy the conditions of this section. ~~The Director of the Human Services Department may approve exceptions to the minimum space requirement based on review of the management plan and an assessment of the economic feasibility of operating a smaller child care facility.~~

 (5) Unless the applicant is the owner of the child care space and is a duly licensed and experienced child care provider approved by the Director of the Human Services Department, the applicant shall provide to the Director a signed agreement, acceptable to such Director, with a duly licensed child care provider, under which the child care provider agrees to operate the child care facility consistent with the terms of this section and of the recorded covenant, and to provide reports and documentation to the City to demonstrate such compliance. ~~The agreement shall have an initial term of no less than three (3) years and shall require both parties to notify the Director of the Human Services Department at least ninety (90) days in advance of the its expiration, if not renewed, or any termination.~~

 (6) One (1) child care facility may fulfill the conditions for a bonus for more than one (1) project if it includes sufficient space, and provides sufficient slots affordable to limited income families, to satisfy the conditions for each such project without any space or child care slot being counted toward the conditions for more than one (1) project. If the child care facility is located on the same lot as one of the projects using the bonus, then the owner of that lot shall be responsible for maintaining compliance with all the requirements applicable to the child care facility; otherwise responsibility for such requirements shall be allocated by agreement in such manner as the Director of the Human Services Department may approve. If a child care facility developed to qualify for bonus floor area by one applicant includes space exceeding the amount necessary for the bonus floor area used by that applicant, then to the extent that the voluntary agreement accepted by the Director of the Human Services Department from that applicant so provides, such excess space may be deemed provided by the applicant for a later project pursuant to a new voluntary agreement signed by both such applicants and by any other owner of the child care facility, and a modification of the recorded covenant, each in form and substance acceptable to such Director.

 c. The Director of the Human Services Department shall review the design and proposed management plan for any child care facility proposed to qualify for bonus floor area to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this section. The allowance of bonus floor area is conditioned upon approval of the design and proposed management plan by the Director. The child care facility shall be constructed consistent with the design approved by such Director and shall be operated for the minimum twenty (20) year term consistent

 with the management plan approved by such Director, in each case with only such modifications as shall be approved by such Director. If the proposed management plan includes provisions for payment of rent or occupancy costs by the provider, the management plan must include a detailed operating budget, staffing ratios, and other information requested by the Director to assess whether the child care facility may be economically feasible and able to deliver quality services.

 d. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of a child care facility to satisfy bonus conditions and related agreements and instruments consistent with this section. The voluntary agreement may provide, in case a child care facility is not maintained in continuous operation consistent with this subsection B2 at any time within the minimum twenty (20) year period, for the City's right to receive payment of a prorated amount of the alternative cash contribution that then would be applicable to a new project seeking bonus floor area. Such Director may require security or evidence of adequate financial responsibility, or both, as a condition to acceptance of an agreement under this subsection.

 5. No permit after the first building permit, and in any event, no permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring or for occupancy of existing floor area by any use based upon TDR, will be issued for development that includes TDR until the applicant's possession of TDR is demonstrated according to rules promulgated by the Director to implement this section.

 B. Standards for Sending Lots.

 1. a. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred, except as open space TDR, Landmark TDR, or Landmark housing TDR, from an eligible sending lot, except a sending lot in the PSM or IDM zones, is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of any ~~existing~~ chargeable gross floor area existing or, if a DMC housing TDR site, to be developed on the sending lot, plus any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.

b. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible open space TDR site is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of (a) any existing chargeable gross floor area that is built on or over the eligible lot area on the sending lot, plus (b) the amount, if any, by which the total of any other chargeable floor area on the sending lot exceeds the product of the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, multiplied by the difference between the total lot area and the eligible lot area, plus (c) any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot. ~~The eligible lot area is the total area of the sending lot, reduced by the excess, if any, of the total of accessory surface parking over one-quarter (1/4) of the total area of the footprints of all structures on the sending lot; and for an open space TDR site, further reduced by any portion of the lot ineligible under Section~~~~23.49.027.~~

c. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible Landmark housing TDR site is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds TDR previously transferred from the sending lot, if any.

d. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible Landmark TDR site, when the chargeable floor area of the landmark structure is less than or equal to the base FAR permitted in the zone, is equivalent to the base FAR of the sending lot, minus any TDR that have been previously transferred. For landmark structures having chargeable floor area greater than the base FAR of the zone, the amount of floor area that may be transferred is limited to an amount equivalent to the base FAR of the sending lot minus the sum of (i) any chargeable floor area of the landmark structure exceeding the base FAR and (ii) any TDR that have been previously transferred.

 3. When TDR are transferred from a sending lot in a zone with a base FAR limit, the amount of chargeable gross floor area that may then be built on the sending lot shall be equal to the area of the lot multiplied by the applicable base FAR limit set in Section 23.49.011, minus the total of:

 a. The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus

 b. The amount of gross floor area transferred from the lot.

 4. When TDR are sent from a sending lot in a PSM zone, the combined maximum chargeable floor area and residential floor area that may then be ~~built~~established on the sending lot shall be equal to the total gross floor area that could have been built on the sending lot consistent with applicable development standards as determined by the Director had no TDR been transferred, less the sum of:

 a. The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus

 b. The amount of gross floor area that was transferred from the lot.

 5. Gross floor area allowed above base FAR under any bonus provisions of this title or the former Title 24, or allowed under any exceptions or waivers of development standards, may not be transferred. TDR may be transferred from a lot that contains chargeable floor area exceeding the base FAR only if the TDR are from an eligible Landmark site, consistent with subsection B1c above, or to the extent, if any, that:

 a. TDR were previously transferred to such lot in compliance with the Land Use Code provisions and applicable rules then in effect;

 b. Those TDR, together with the base FAR under Section 23.49.011, exceed the chargeable floor area on the lot and any additional chargeable floor area for which any permit has been issued or for which any permit application is pending; and

 c. The excess amount of TDR previously transferred to such lot would have been eligible for transfer from the original sending lot under the provisions of this section at the time of their original transfer from that lot.

Landmark buildings on lots from which Landmark housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated to the extent required to provide  decent, sanitary and habitable housing, in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least fifty (50) years from the time of the TDR transfer, as approved by the Director of the Office of Housing and the Landmarks Preservation Board.

If housing TDR or Landmark housing TDR are proposed to be transferred prior to the completion of work necessary to satisfy this subsection B7, the Director of the Office of Housing may require, as a condition to such transfer, that security be deposited with the City to ensure the completion of such work.

 8. The housing units on a lot from which housing TDR, Landmark housing TDR, or DMC housing TDR are transferred, and that are committed to low-income housing ~~or low-moderate income housing~~ use as a condition to eligibility of the lot as a ~~housing~~ TDR sending lot~~site~~, shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the Housing Director, after completion of any rehabilitation or construction undertaken in order to qualify as a ~~housing~~ TDR sending lot~~site~~.

 C. Limit on within-block TDR.

 Any receiving lot is limited to a gain of ~~one (1) FAR or~~ fifteen (15) percent of the floor area above the first increment of FAR above the base FAR, as specified in subsection 23.49.011A2a,~~, whichever is less,~~ from TDR from sending lots that are eligible to send TDR solely because they are on the same block as the receiving lot.~~; provided that this limitation shall not apply to within block TDR in the DMC and DOC1 zones for the purpose of building a structure that contains a museum or a museum expansion space that meets the requirements of subsection 23.49.011 B1g.~~

 D. Transfer of Development Rights Deeds and Agreements.

 1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed with the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot, unless (in the case of TDR from a housing TDR site, Landmark housing TDR site or DMC housing TDR site) such consent is waived by the Director of the Office of Housing for good cause, which deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. When TDR are conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying such lot or the TDR, the TDR shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using such TDR shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDR previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made. If the TDR are transferred other than directly from the sending lot to the receiving lot using the TDR, then after the initial transfer, all subsequent transfers also shall be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, each referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.

 2. Any person may purchase any TDR that are eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this section, whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop downtown real property. Any purchaser of such TDR (including any successor or assignee) may use such TDR to obtain ~~FAR~~ chargeable floor area above the applicable base on a receiving lot to the extent such use of TDR is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions in effect on the date of vesting, under applicable law, of such person's rights with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use such TDR. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDR or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDR to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDR have been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that such owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that such TDR are not available for retransfer.

 3. For transfers of housing TDR, Landmark housing TDR, or DMC housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement, with the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot, unless such consent is waived by the Director of the Office of Housing for good cause, to provide for the maintenance of the required housing on the sending lot for a minimum of fifty (50) years. Such agreement shall commit to limits on rent and occupancy, consistent with the definition of housing TDR site, Landmark housing TDR site, or DMC housing TDR site, as applicable, and acceptable to the Director of the Office of Housing.

 4. For transfers of Landmark TDR or Landmark housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement in form and content acceptable to the Landmarks Preservation Board providing for the restoration and maintenance of the historically significant features of the structure or structures on the lot.

 5. A deed conveying TDR may require or permit the return of the TDR to the sending lot under specified conditions, but notwithstanding any such provisions:

 a. The transfer of TDR to a receiving lot shall remain effective so long as any portion of any structure for which a permit was issued based upon such transfer remains on the receiving lot; and

 b. The City shall not be required to recognize any return of TDR unless it is demonstrated that all parties in the chain of title have executed, acknowledged and recorded instruments conveying any interest in the TDR back to the sending lot and any ~~lienholders~~lien holders have released any liens thereon.

 6. Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending lot shall provide that its covenants or conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by The City of Seattle.

 E. TDR Sales Before Base FAR Increases and Changes in Exemptions.

 Except for transfers of TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, transfers of TDR from any lot from which a TDR transfer was made prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443 are limited to the amount of TDR available from such lot immediately prior to such date.

 F. Projects Developed Under Prior Code Provisions.

 1. Any project that is developed pursuant to a master use permit issued under the provisions of this title as in effect prior to the effective date of ~~the~~ordinance 120443 ~~codified in this chapter~~ ,which permit provides for the use of TDR, may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with such prior provisions prior to such effective date.

 2. In addition or in the alternative, such a project may use TDR that are transferred from a sending lot after the effective date of ~~the~~ordinance 120443 ~~codified in this chapter~~.

 3. The use of TDR by any such project must be consistent with the provisions of this title applicable to the project, including any limits on the range of FAR in which a type of TDR may be used, except that ~~open space~~open space TDR may be used by such a project in lieu of any other TDR or any bonus, or both, allowable under such provisions.

 G. TDR Satisfying Conditions to Transfer Under Prior Code.

 1. If the conditions to transfer Landmark TDR, as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443, the following are satisfied on or before December 31, 2001, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer as determined under the provisions of this title in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443. If the conditions to transfer housing TDR are satisfied prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443 under the provisions of this title then in effect, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer immediately prior to that effective date. If the conditions to transfer TDR from a major performing arts facility are satisfied prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443 under the provisions of this Title then in effect, TDR may be transferred from the sending lot after that effective date, for use on any receiving lots in zones where housing TDR may be used according to Chart 23.49.014 A, in an amount as determined under subsection B of this section, provided that the cumulative amount of TDR that may be transferred after June1, 2005 from any sending lot based on the presence of a major performing arts facility is limited to 150,000 square feet.

 2. For purposes of this subsection, conditions to transfer include, without limitations, the execution by the owner of the sending lot, and recording in the King County real property records, of any agreement required by the provisions of this title or the Public Benefit Features Rule in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443, but such conditions do not include any requirement for a master use permit application for a project intending to use TDR, or any action connected with a receiving lot. TDR transferable under this subsection G are eligible either for use consistent with the terms of Section 23.49.011 or for use by projects developed pursuant to permits issued under the provisions of this title in effect prior to the effective date of Ordinance 120443. The use of TDR transferred under this subsection G on the receiving lot shall be subject only to those conditions and limits that apply for purposes of the master use permit decision for the project using the TDR.

 H. Time of Determination of TDR Eligible for Transfer. Except as stated in subsection G, the eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDR, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use such TDR.

 I. Use of Previously Transferred TDR by New Projects.

 Any project using TDR according to applicable limits on types and amounts of TDR in Section 23.49.011 may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with the provisions of this title in effect at the time of such transfer. For purposes of this subsection I, the owner of TDR that were transferred based upon a housing commitment accepted by the City shall be entitled to have such TDR considered as housing TDR.

 Section 17. Section 23.49.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 120117, is hereby repealed.

 Section 18 . Subchapter I of Chapter 23.49 is amended to add the following new section:

 23.49.015 Bonus residential floor area for voluntary agreements for low-income housing and moderate income housing.

 A. General Provisions.

 1. The purpose of this section is to encourage residential development in addition to that authorized by basic zoning regulations ("bonus development"), provided that certain adverse impacts from the bonus development are mitigated. "Basic zoning regulations" for purposes of this section are the provisions of Section 23.49.008 that determine base height limits for residential use in DOC-1, DOC-2 and DMC zones, and for DMC zones, the provisions of Section 23.49.058 that determine the maximum average floor area per story. The City has determined that one impact of high-rise residential development is an increased need for low-income housing and moderate-income housing downtown to house the families of workers having lower paid jobs who serve the residents of such development. The City also finds that DOC-1, DOC-2 , and DMC zones are areas in which increased residential development will assist in achieving local growth management and housing policies, and has determined that increased residential development capacity and height of residential structures can be achieved within these zones, subject to consideration of other regulatory controls on development. The City Council finds that in the case of affordable housing for rental occupancy, use of the income level for low-income housing rather than a lower level is necessary to address local housing market conditions, and that in the case of affordable housing for owner occupancy, higher income levels than those for low-income housing are needed to address local housing market conditions. The City hereby adopts the extension of the authority of Chapter 149, Laws of 2006 of the State of Washington, to the bonus development program under this Section 23.49.015, in addition to the City's preexisting authority. To the extent that any provision of this Section or the application thereof to any project for which a Master Use Permit application is considered under the Land Use Code as in effect after the effective date of Section 2 of Chapter 149, Laws of 2006 would conflict with any requirement of that statute, the terms of this Section shall be deemed modified to conform to the requirements of Section 2 of Chapter 149, Laws of 2006.

 2. An applicant may elect to seek bonus development under this section only for a project in a DOC1, DOC2 or DMC zone that includes residential development. If an applicant elects to seek approval of bonus development under this section, the applicant must execute a voluntary agreement with the City in which the applicant agrees to provide mitigation for impacts described in subsection A1 of this section. The mitigation may be provided in the form of low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or both, either within or adjacent to the residential project using the bonus development (the "performance option"), by paying the City to build or provide the housing (the "payment option"), or by a combination of the performance and payment options.

 3. No bonus development under this section shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a Landmark structure unless a Certificate of Approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

 4. No bonus development under this section shall be granted for any housing in a new structure unless the applicant makes a commitment that the structure shall earn a LEED Silver rating. When such a commitment is made, the provisions of SMC Section 23.49.020 shall apply. This subsection 4 shall expire and be of no further effect five (5) years after the effective date of this ordinance.

 5. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus development under this section shall include a calculation of the amount of bonus development sought and shall identify the manner in which the conditions to such bonus development shall be satisfied. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any such bonus development, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus development to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus development, which decision may include alternative means to achieve bonus development, at the applicant's option, if each alternative would be consistent with any other conditions of the permit, including Design Review conditions if applicable.

 B. Voluntary Agreements for Housing.

 1. The voluntary agreement shall commit the applicant to provide or contribute to low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or both, in an amount as set forth in this subsection B. The quantities in this subsection are based on findings of an analysis that quantifies the linkages between new market-rate units in high-rise residential structures in DOC1, DOC2, and DMC zones and the demand that residents of such units generate for low-income housing and moderate-income housing. The amount of such housing and income levels served, and the amount of any cash payment, shall be determined as follows:

 a. For the performance option, the applicant shall provide, as low-income housing or moderate-income housing, net rentable floor area equal to eleven (11) percent of the net residential floor area sought as bonus development, computed by multiplying the following sum by an efficiency factor of eighty (80) percent: (i) the total square footage of gross residential floor area to be developed on the lot above the base height limit for residential use under SMC Section 23.49.008, plus (ii) the excess, if any, in each tower to be developed on the lot, of (X) the total number of square feet of gross residential floor area between the height of eighty-five (85) feet and such base height limit, over (Y) the product of the "average residential gross floor area limit of stories above 85 feet if height does not exceed the base height limit for residential use" as provided in Chart 23.49.058D1, column 2, multiplied by the number of stories with residential use in such tower above eighty-five (85) feet and below such base height limit. All low-income housing or moderate income housing provided under the performance option shall be on the lot where the bonus development is used or an adjacent lot. The adjacent lot must be within the block where the bonus development is used and either abut the lot where bonus development is used, or be separated only by public right-of- way. All rental housing provided under the performance option shall be low-income housing.

 b. For the payment option, the applicant shall pay the lesser of the following:

 (1) an amount that equals the approximate cost of developing the same number and quality of housing units that would be developed under the performance option, as determined by the Director ; or

 (2) (i) in DMC zones, ten (10) dollars per square foot of net residential floor area sought as bonus development between the height of eighty-five (85) feet and the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008, fifteen (15) dollars per square foot of the net residential floor area of the first four (4) floors above the base height limit for residential use, twenty (20) dollars per square foot of net residential floor area of the next three (3) floors, and twenty-five (25) dollars per square foot of net residential floor area of the remaining floors up to the maximum residential height limit, not to exceed an average of eighteen dollars and ninety-four cents (18.94) per square foot of net residential floor area sought as bonus development; and (ii) in DOC1 and DOC2 zones, eighteen dollars and ninety-four cents (18.94) per square foot of net residential floor area sought as bonus development above the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008. Net residential floor area shall be computed by multiplying the total gross floor area sought as bonus development by an efficiency factor of eighty (80) percent. The full amount must be paid to the City in cash, except that if the City shall approve by ordinance the acceptance of specific real property in lieu of all or part of the cash payment, the Housing Director may accept such real property.

 2. Each low-income housing unit provided as a condition to the bonus allowed under this section shall serve only households with incomes at or below eighty (80) percent of median income at the time of their initial occupancy. Each moderate-income housing unit provided as a condition to the bonus allowed under this section shall serve only as owner-occupied housing for households with incomes no higher than median income at the time of their initial occupancy. For rental housing, housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, shall not exceed 30% of eighty (80) percent of median income, adjusted for the average size of family expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, all as determined by the Housing Director, for a minimum period of fifty (50) years. For owner-occupied housing, the initial sale price shall not exceed an amount determined by the Housing Director to be consistent with affordable housing for a moderate-income household with the average family size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, and the units shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the Housing Director providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis. The Housing Director may promulgate rules specifying the method of determining affordability, including eligible monthly housing costs. The Housing Director may also promulgate rules for determining whether units satisfy the requirements of this section and any requirements relating to down-payment amount, design, quality, maintenance and condition of the low-income housing or moderate- income housing.

 3. For purposes of this section, housing may be considered to be provided by the applicant seeking bonus development under the performance option if the housing satisfies all of the following conditions:

 (i) It is committed to serve an eligible income group, and for a time period, referred to in this section pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City.

 (ii) The agreement required by subsection (i) is executed and recorded prior to the issuance of the master use permit to establish the use for the project using the bonus development, but except when subsection (iii)(B) below applies, no earlier than 1 year prior to issuance of that master use permit.

 (iii) Either (A) the Certificate of Occupancy for the new low- income housing or moderate income housing, or both, must be issued within 3 years of the date the Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the project using the bonus, development unless the Housing Director approves an extension based on delays that the applicant or housing developer

 could not reasonably have avoided, or (B) only in the case of low- income housing on a lot adjacent to the project using bonus development, which housing is subject to a regulatory agreement related to long-term City financing of low-income housing and was developed under a master use permit issued pursuant to a decision that considered the housing together with a project then proposed on that adjacent site, a final Certificate of Occupancy for the low- income housing was issued within 5 years of the building permit issuance for the project proposed for bonus development on the adjacent lot.

 (iv) If the low-income housing or moderate-income housing is not owned by the applicant, then the applicant made a financial contribution to the low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or promised such contribution and has provided to the City an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit to ensure its payment, in form and content satisfactory to the Housing Director, in either case in an amount determined by the Housing Director to be, when reduced by the value of any expected benefits to be received for such contribution other than the bonus development, approximately equal to the cost of providing units within the project using the bonus development, and the owner of the low-income housing or moderate- income housing has entered into a linkage agreement with the applicant pursuant to which only the applicant has the right to claim such housing for purposes of bonus development under this section or any other bonus under this title.

 4. Any applicant seeking to qualify for bonus floor area based on development of new housing shall provide to the City, prior to the date when a contribution would be due for the cash option under subsection C of this section, an irrevocable bank letter of credit or other sufficient security approved by the Director of the Office of Housing, and a related voluntary agreement, so that at the end of the three (3) year period specified in subsection B3 of this section, if the housing does not qualify or is not provided in a sufficient amount to satisfy the terms of this section, the City shall receive (i) a cash contribution for housing in the amount determined pursuant to this section after credit for any qualifying housing then provided, plus (ii) an amount equal to interest on such contribution, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted from time to time by Bank of America, or its successor, plus three (3) percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit for the project using the bonus. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any such security, the Director of the Office of Housing shall take appropriate steps to do so, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash contributions for housing made under this section. In the case of any project proposing to use bonus development for which no building permit is required, references to the building permit in this subsection shall mean the master use permit allowing establishment or expansion of the use for which bonus development is sought.

 5. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer on any owner or developer of housing, any party to a linkage agreement, or any assignee, any development rights or property interests. Because the availability and terms of allowance of bonus development depend upon the regulations in effect at the relevant time for the project proposing to use such bonus development, pursuant to SMC Section 23.76.026, any approvals or agreements by the Director of the Office of Housing regarding the eligibility of actual or proposed housing as to satisfy conditions of a bonus, and any approval of a linkage agreement and/or assignment, do not grant any vested rights, nor guarantee that any bonus development will be permitted based on such housing.

 6. The Director of the Office of Housing is authorized to accept and execute agreements and instruments to implement this section. For the performance option, the voluntary agreement by the applicant or, if the applicant is not the housing owner, then a recorded agreement of the housing owner acceptable to the Housing Director, shall provide for an initial monitoring fee payable to the City of $500 per unit of low-income housing or moderate-income housing provided, and in the case of rental housing, an annual monitoring fee payable to the City of $65 for each such unit. For rental housing, such agreement also shall require the housing owner to submit to the City annual reports with such information as the Housing Director shall require for monitoring purposes. In the case of housing for owner-occupancy, the recorded resale restrictions also shall include a provision requiring payment to the City, on any sale or other transfer, of a fee of $500 for the review and processing of transfer documents to determine compliance with income and affordability restrictions.

 7. If the Housing Director shall certify to the Director that the Housing Director has accepted and there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Housing Director providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on housing provided for purposes of the performance option under this section, and that either all affordable housing has been completed or the applicant has provided the City with an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit satisfactory to the Housing Director in the amount of the contribution to the affordable housing approved by the Housing Director, if applicable, then any failure of such housing to satisfy the requirements of this subsection B shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus development. Unless and until the Housing Director shall so certify, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus floor area based on the provision of housing under this subsection, that the low-income or moderate-income housing units, or both, as applicable, shall continue to satisfy the requirements of this subsection throughout the term specified in this

 section and that such compliance shall be documented to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Housing. The Director of the Office of Housing may provide by rule for circumstances in which low-income or moderate-income housing units, or both, as applicable, may be replaced if lost due to casualty or other causes, and for terms and conditions upon which a cash contribution may be made in lieu of continuing to provide low-income housing or moderate- income housing, or both, under the terms of this subsection.

 8. Housing units produced with voluntary contributions made under this section, shall include a range of unit sizes, including units suitable for families with children. Housing units provided to qualify for bonus development shall comply with the following: (i) they shall be provided in a range of sizes comparable to those available to other residents; (ii) to the extent practicable, the number of bedrooms in low-income units and moderate-income units must be in the same proportion as the number of bedrooms in units within the entire building; (iii) the low-income units and moderate-income units shall generally be distributed throughout the building, except that they may be provided in an adjacent building; and (iv) the low- income units and moderate-income units shall have substantially the same functionality as the other units in the building or buildings. The Housing Director is authorized to prescribe by rule standards and procedures for determining compliance with the requirements of this subsection 7.The Housing Director is further authorized to adopt policies for distribution of unit sizes in housing developments funded by contributions received under this section.

 9. References in this subsection B to a Certificate of Occupancy for a project mean the first Certificate of Occupancy issued by the City for the project, whether temporary or permanent.

 C. Cash Option Payments.

 1. The Director of the Office of Housing may adjust the alternative cash contribution, no more frequently than annually, approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982 - 84=100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, or any other relevant and appropriate index that such Director may deem appropriate. Any such adjustment to the cash contribution amounts may be implemented through a rule-making process.

 2. Cash payments under voluntary agreements for bonuses shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, unless the applicant elects in writing to defer payment. If the applicant elects to defer payment, then the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the project shall be conditioned upon payment of the full amount of the cash payment determined under this Section, plus an interest factor equal to that amount multiplied by the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, West Region, All Items, 1962-64=100, as published monthly, from the last month prior to the date when payment would have been required if deferred payment had not been elected, to the last month for which data are available at the time of payment. If the index specified in this subsection is not available for any reason, the Director shall select a substitute cost of living index. In no case shall the interest factor be less than zero. All payments under this Section shall be deposited in special accounts established solely to fund capital expenditures for the affordable housing for low-income households.

 D. No Subsidies for Bonused Housing: Exception.

 1. Intent. Housing provided through the bonus system is intended to mitigate a portion of the additional low-income housing needs resulting from increased high-rise market rate housing development, beyond those needs that would otherwise exist, which the City and other governmental and charitable entities attempt to meet through various subsidy programs. Allowing bonus development under the performance option for housing that uses such subsidy programs therefore could undermine the intent of this section.

 2. Agreement Concerning Subsidies. The Director of the Office of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus floor area for housing under the performance option, that the owner of the lot upon which the low-income housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, including without limitation those items referred to in subsection D3 of this section, related to the housing, except for any subsidies that may be allowed by the Director of the Office of Housing under that subsection. The Housing Director may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate account to be used for Downtown low-income housing, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.

 3. No Bonus for Subsidized or Restricted Housing. In general, no bonus may be earned by providing housing if:

 a. Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, State of Washington housing funds, or property tax exemptions or other special tax treatment; or

 b. The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus, subject to any restrictions on the use, occupancy or rents.

 4. Exceptions by Rule. The Director of the Office of Housing may provide, by rule promulgated after the effective date of this ordinance, for terms and conditions on which exceptions to the restriction on subsidies in this subsection may be allowed. Such rule may provide that, as a condition to any exception, the Director of the Office of Housing shall increase the amount of floor area of low- income housing or moderate-income housing per square foot of bonus development, otherwise determined pursuant to subsection B of this section, to an amount that allows credit for only the Director's estimate of the incremental effect, in meeting the City's housing needs for the next fifty (50) years, of the net financial contribution that is being made by the applicant pursuant to the voluntary agreement and not funded or reimbursed, directly or indirectly, from any other source.

 Section 19. Section 23.49.016 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 121196, is hereby repealed.

 Section 20. Subchapter I of Chapter 23.49 is amended to renumber Section 23.49.009, which was last amended by Ordinance 121477, and amend it as follows:

 23.49.016 Open space.

 A. Finding. The City Council finds that:

 1. Office workers are the principal users of Downtown open space.

 2. Additional major office projects Downtown will result in increased use of public open space.

 3. If additional major office projects Downtown do not provide open space to offset the additional demands on public open space caused by such projects, the result will be overcrowding of public open space, adversely affecting the public health, safety and welfare.

 4. The additional open space needed to accommodate office workers is at least twenty (20) square feet for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of office space.

 5. Smaller office developments may encounter design problems in incorporating open space, and the sizes of open spaces provided for office projects under eighty-five thousand (85,000) square feet may make them less attractive and less likely to be used. Therefore, and in order not to discourage small scale office development, projects involving less than eighty-five thousand (85,000) square feet of new office space should be exempt from any open space requirement.

 6. As indicated in ~~DPD's~~the October 1994 report  of the Department of Construction and Land Use, with the exception of certain projects, most major recent Downtown office projects have provided significant amounts of on-site open space. Therefore, requiring open space for future major projects will tend to ensure that existing projects do not bear the burdens caused by new development and will result in an average reciprocity of advantage.

 B. Quantity of Open Space. Open space in the amount of twenty (20) square feet for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of gross office floor area shall be required of projects that include eighty-five thousand (85,000) or more square feet of gross office floor area in

 DOC1, DOC2, DMC, DMR/C and DH2 zones, except that the floor area of a museum expansion space, satisfying the provisions of Section 23.49.011 B1~~g~~h, shall be excluded from the calculation of gross office floor area.

 C. Standards for Open Space. To satisfy this requirement, open space may be provided on-site or off-site, as follows:

 1. Private Open Space. Private open space on the project site or on an adjacent lot directly accessible from the project site may satisfy the requirement of this section. Such space shall not be eligible for ~~public benefit feature~~ bonuses. Private open space shall be open to the sky and shall be consistent with the general conditions related to landscaping, seating andfurnishings contained in the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards. Private open space satisfying this requirement must be accessible to all tenants of the building and their employees.

 2. On-site Public Open Space.

 a. Open space provided on the project site under this requirement shall be eligible for ~~public benefit~~amenity feature bonuses, as allowed for each zone, provided the open space is open to the public without charge and meets the standards of Section 23.49.013 and the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards for one (1) or more of the following:

 * Parcel park;

 * Green street setback and green street improvement on an abutting right-of-way;

 * Hillside terrace;

 * Harborfront open space; or

 * Urban plaza.

 b. On-site open space satisfying the requirement of subsection C2a of this section may achieve a bonus as an~~public benefit~~amenity feature not to exceed any limits pursuant to Section 23.49.013, subject to the conditions in this chapter, which bonus shall be counted against, and not increase, the total FAR bonus available from the provision of ~~Public Benefit~~amenity ~~F~~features.

 3. Off-site Public Open Space.

 a. Open space satisfying the requirement of this section may be on a site other than the project site, provided that it is within a Downtown zone, within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the project site, open to the public without charge, and at least five thousand (5,000) square feet in contiguous area. The minimum size of off-site open space and maximum distance from the project may be increased or decreased for a project if the Director determines that such adjustments are reasonably necessary to provide for open space that will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project and enhance public access.

 b. Public open space provided on a site other than the project site may qualify for a development bonus for the project if the open space meets the standards of Section 23.49.013 and is one of the open space features citied in subsection C2a of this section. Bonus ratios for off-site open space ~~shall be as set forth~~are prescribed in Section 23.49.013.~~Projects that provide off-site open space satisfying this requirement may achieve a public benefit feature bonus not to exceed any limits pursuant to~~~~Section 23.49.013, which shall be~~ This bonus is counted against, and may not increase, the total ~~FAR~~amount of bonus  development ~~available from the provision of Public Benefit Features~~allowed under Section 23.49.011 and Section 23.49.013 .

 4. Easement for Off-site Open Space. The owner of any lot on which off-site open space is provided to meet the requirements of this section shall execute and record an easement in a form acceptable to the Director assuring compliance with the requirements of this section, including applicable conditions of the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards. The Director is authorized to accept such an easement, provided that the terms do not impose any costs or obligations on the City.

 D. Payment in Lieu. In lieu of providing open space under this requirement, an owner may make a payment to the City if the Director determines that the payment will contribute to the improvement of a designated green street or to other public open space improvements  abutting the lot or in the vicinity, in an amount sufficient to develop improvements that will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project, and that the improvement ~~of such green street~~ within a reasonable time is feasible. Any such payment shall be placed in a dedicated fund or account and used within five (5) years of receipt for the development of such ~~a green street~~ improvements, unless the property owner and the City agree upon another use involving the acquisition or development of public open space that will mitigate the impact of the project. A bonus may be allowed for a payment ~~for green street~~in lieu of providing improvement made wholly or in part to satisfy the requirements of this section, pursuant to Section 23.49.013.

 E. Limitations. Open space satisfying the requirement of this section for any project shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement for any other project, nor shall any bonus be granted to any project for open space meeting the requirement of this section for any other project. When a transmitting antenna is sited or proposed to be sited on a rooftop where required open space is located, see Section 23.57.013. Open space on the site of any building for which a Master Use Permit decision was issued or a complete building permit application was filed prior to the effective date of ~~the~~ordinance 117430 ~~codified in this section~~, that is not required under the Land Use Code in effect when such permit decision was issued or such application filed but that would have been required for the same building by this section, shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement or to gain an FAR bonus for any other project.

 F. Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the Growth Management Act, the City's Comprehensive Plan and the City's inherent police power authority. The City Council finds that the requirements of this section are necessary to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare.

If the Director determines that the design for the open space will substantially satisfy the intent of the guidelines as a whole, the Director need not require that every guideline be satisfied as a condition to approval. Open space should be designed to:

 1. Be well integrated with downtown's pedestrian and transit network;

 2. Be oriented to promote access to sun and views and protection from wind, taking into account potential development on adjacent lots built to the maximum limits zoning allows;

 3. Enhance user safety and security and ease of maintenance;

 4. Be highly visible because of the relation to the street grid, topographic conditions, surrounding development pattern, or other factors, thereby enhancing public access and identification of the space as a significant component of the urban landscape;

 5. Incorporate various features, such as seating and access to food service, that are appropriate to the type of area and that will enhance public use of the area as provided by the guidelines for an urban plaza in the ~~Public Benefit Features~~~~Rule~~ Downtown Amenity Standards;

 6. Provide such ingress and egress as will make the areas easily accessible to the general public along street perimeters;

 7. Be aesthetically pleasing space that is well integrated with the surrounding area through landscaping and special elements, which should establish an identity for the space while providing for the comfort of those using it;

 F. Public Access.

 1. Recorded Documents. The open space must be subject to a recorded easement, or other instrument acceptable to the Director, to limit any future development on the lot and to ensure general public access and the preservation and maintenance of the open space, unless such requirement is waived by the Director for open space in public ownership. The Director is authorized to accept such an easement or instrument, so long as its terms do not impose obligations or costs on the City.

 2. Hours of Operation. The open space must be open to the general public without charge for reasonable and predictable hours, such as those for a public park, for a minimum of ~~six (6)~~ ten (10) hours each day of every week. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow individuals to engage in activities allowed in public parks of a similar nature. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the open space, or adjacent buildings or features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others.

 3. Plaque Requirement. A plaque indicating the nature of the site and its availability for general public access must be placed in a visible location at the entrances to the site. The text on the plaque is subject to the approval of the Director.

 G. Maintenance. The property owner and/or another responsible party who shall have assumed obligations for maintenance on terms approved by the Director, shall maintain all elements of the site, including but not limited to landscaping, parking, seating and lighting, in a safe and clean condition as provided for in a maintenance plan to be approved by the Director.

H. Special exception for Open Space TDR sites.  The Director may authorize an exception to the requirements for open space TDR sites in subsection D of this Section, as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permit and Council Land Use Decisions.

1. The provisions of this subsection H will be used by the Director in determining whether to grant, grant with condition or deny a special exception. The Director may grant exceptions only to the extent such exceptions further the provisions of this subsection H.

2. In order for the Director to grant, or grant with conditions, an exception to the requirements for open space TDR sites, the following must be satisfied:

a. The exception allows the design of the open space to take advantage of unusual site characteristics or conditions in the surrounding area, such as views and relationship to surroundings; and

b. The applicant demonstrates that the exceptions would result in an open-space that better meets the intent of the provisions for open space TDR sites in subsection G of this Section.

 Section 29. Subchapter I of Chapter 23.49 is amended to add the following new section:

 23.49.020 Demonstration of LEED Silver rating.

 A. Applicability. This section applies whenever a commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating or substantially equivalent standard is a condition of a permit pursuant to SMC Section 23.49.011 or 23.49.015.

 B. Demonstration of Compliance; Penalties.

 1. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Director the extent to which the applicant has complied with the commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating no later than ninety days after issuance of final Certificate of Occupancy for the new structure, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause, by submitting a report analyzing the extent credits earned toward such rating from the U.S. Green Building Council or another independent entity approved by the Director. For purposes of this section, if the Director shall have approved a commitment to achieve a substantially equivalent standard, the term "LEED Silver rating" shall mean such other standard.

 2. Failure to submit a timely report regarding a LEED Silver rating from an approved independent entity by the date required is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for such violation shall be $500 per day from the date when the report was due to the date it is submitted, without any requirement of notice to the applicant.

 3. Failure to demonstrate, through an independent report as provided in this subsection, full compliance with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating, is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is an amount determined as follows:

 P= [(LSM-CE)/LSM] x CV x 0.0075,

 where:

 P is the penalty;

 LSM is the minimum number of credits to earn a LEED Silver rating;

 CE is the number of credits earned as documented by the report; and

 CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.

 Example:

 Construction Value $ 200,000,000.00

 Minimum LEED Credits for Silver rating 33

 Credits Earned 32

 Penalty = [(33-32)/33] x 200,000,000 x .0075 = $45,454.55

 4. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection B3 of this section, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.

 5. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating. If the Director determines that the applicant did not demonstrate compliance with its commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating in accordance with this section, the Director may give notice of such determination, and of the calculation of the penalty due, to the applicant.

 6. If, within 90 days, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, after initial notice from the Director of a penalty due under this subsection, the applicant shall demonstrate, through a supplemental report from the independent entity that provided the initial report, that it has made sufficient alterations or improvements to earn a LEED Silver rating, or to earn more credits toward such a rating, then the penalty owing shall be eliminated or recalculated accordingly. The amount of the penalty as so redetermined shall be final. If the applicant does not submit a supplemental report in accordance with this subsection by the date required under this subsection, then the amount of the penalty as set forth in the Director's original notice shall be final.

 7. Any owner, other than the applicant, of any lot on which the bonus development was obtained or any part thereof, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance and liable for any penalty due under this subsection.

 C. Use of Penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsection B of this section.

When development is proposed on a lot that will retain existing structures containing chargeable floor area in excess of the applicable base FAR, additional chargeable floor area may be added to the lot up to the maximum permitted FAR, by qualifying for bonuses or using TDR, or both, and by the use of rural development credits if permitted on such lot, subject to the general rules for FAR and use of bonuses,~~and~~ TDR, and rural development credits, SMC Sections 23.49.011 through 23.49.014. Solely for the purpose of determining the amounts and types of bonus and TDR, if any, that may be used to achieve the proposed increase in chargeable floor area, the legally established continuing chargeable floor area of the existing structures on the lot shall be considered as the base FAR.

 * * *

 Section 34. The following subsections of Section 23.49.034 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 112522, are amended as follows, and a new subsection G is added:

 23.49.034 Modification of plazas and other features bonused under Title 24

 A. The modification of plazas, shopping plazas, arcades, shopping arcades, and voluntary building setbacks ~~which~~that resulted in any increase in gross floor area under Title 24 of the Seattle Municipal Code, shall be encouraged in any Downtown zone if the change makes the plaza, arcade or setback more closely conform to the ~~requirements~~criteria for amenities or street level use and development standards in~~of~~ this chapter. The Director shall review proposed modifications to determine whether they provide greater public benefits and are consistent with the intent of the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards, as specified in this section. The procedure for approval of proposed modifications shall be as provided in Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, except as provided in subsection G of this section.

 * * *

 C. Plazas and Shopping Plazas. Modifications to plazas and shopping plazas for which increased gross floor area was granted under Title 24 shall be permitted, based on the classification of the plaza on Map 1E.

 1. Type I Plazas. Type I plazas shall continue to function as major downtown open spaces. Modification of these plazas and/or reductions in plaza size shall be permitted if the Director finds that the modified or remaining plaza is consistent with the intent of the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards  for urban plazas and parcel parks.

 2. Type II Plazas. Type II plazas do not function as major downtown open spaces, but they shall continue to provide open space for the public. Modification of these plazas and/or reductions in plaza size shall be permitted if the Director finds that the modified or remaining plaza is consistent with the intent of the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards for urban plazas, parcel parks, and hillside terraces~~, and rooftop gardens~~.

 D. Shopping Arcades.

 1. Exterior Shopping Arcades. When street level uses are eligible for a floor area bonus in a zone in which an existing exterior shopping arcade is located, the existing shopping arcade or a portion of the existing shopping arcade may be converted to retail sales and service uses if the conversion will result in greater conformity with the street facade development standards of the zone, and if the minimum sidewalk widths established by Section 23.49.022 are met. No bonuses shall be given for any retail space created by conversion of a shopping arcade. New retail sales and service uses shall comply with the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards for retail shopping bonuses.

 2. Interior Shopping Arcades. Portions of existing interior shopping arcades may be modified and/or reduced in size, so long as any pathway which connects streets or other public open spaces is maintained at a width of at least fifteen (15) feet and it continues to allow comfortable and convenient pedestrian movement. The visual interest and the sense of space and light in the shopping arcade shall be also maintained and enhanced if possible. The ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards for shopping atriums and shopping corridors~~bonuses~~ shall be used as a guideline in the review of proposed changes.

 * * *

G. Optional Public Access and Signage Standards. The owner of any lot with a plaza, arcade, shopping plaza, or exterior shopping arcade for which a bonus was granted under Title 24, and which feature has not become subject to standards for amenity features under Title 23, may elect to have the signage requirements and the terms of public access and use for that feature governed by the Downtown Amenity Standards as they apply to urban plazas, as modified by this subsection G. If the owner so elects, then the hours during which such feature must be open to the public without charge shall be as designated by the owner on signs identifying the feature, but in any event shall include the period from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM every day, plus any other hours during which the principal structure on the lot is open. In order to make an election under this subsection G, the owner shall sign and record in the real property records a declaration in form approved by the Director. The owner then shall install and maintain signs identifying the feature as open to the public, consistent with the Downtown Amenity Standards. Such election, once made, may not be revoked or modified. The public access and signage requirements pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed conditions of any permit under which a bonus was allowed for the feature. The purpose of this subsection is to encourage public awareness and use of features bonused under Title 24, while providing for greater certainty and consistency in the rules applicable to such features. Until an election shall be made as to any such feature in compliance with this subsection G, nothing in this subsection G shall limit any obligation to allow public access or use of any such feature under the terms of any permit or Code provision.

 Section 35. Section 23.49.035 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119484, is amended as follows:

 or owner's agent ~~is responsible for notifying~~shall notify  the Director within five (5) days of the date that notice of intent to move is given or that the occupant or operator moves out, whichever is earlier.

 2. Starting from the fifth day after notice is given or that the occupant or operator moves out, whichever is first, the owner or owner's agent shall have a maximum of six (6) months to replace the use with another ~~one which~~use that meets the provisions of ~~this Code~~Section 23.49.011 and the ~~Public Benefit Features Rule~~Downtown Amenity Standards.

 3. When the public benefit feature is replaced, any portion of the gross floor area formerly occupied by that feature and not reoccupied by a replacement feature, may be either:

 a. Changed to other uses ~~which~~that are exempt from FAR calculations in the zone in which the structure is located; or

 b. Changed to uses ~~which~~that are not exempt from FAR calculations, provided that this would not cause the structure to exceed the maximum FAR limit for the zone in which it is located, and that gross floor area in an amount equivalent to the gross floor area proposed to be changed shall be achieved through provision of public benefit features, or transfer of development rights, according to the provisions of SMC Section 23.49.011~~the zone in which the structure is located~~.

 4. As a condition to allowing the substitution of a feature, rather than an application to establish floor area de novo under the terms of this chapter,~~D~~during the time that the space formerly constituting the amenity feature is vacant, it shall be made available to nonprofit community and charitable organizations for events at no charge.

E. Modifications of amenity features that do not result in the diminishment or discontinuation of the feature may be permitted by the Director as a Type I decision, provided that the Director finds that the feature as modified meets the eligibility conditions in the Downtown Amenity Standards.

 Section 36. Section 23.49.036 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 120691, is amended as follows:

In those zones where an increase in floor area ratio is permitted through provision of public benefit features, and a bonus value has not been established for a public benefit feature, the value shall be the same as the value of the feature in the nearest zone for which a value is established.~~ All increases in floor area above the base FAR shall be consistent with provisions in Section 23.49.011, Floor area ratio, and the PCD process shall not result in any ~~reduction~~increase in the amount of  chargeable floor area ~~required to be~~allowed without ~~gained through~~ use of bonuses or TDR ~~compared to what otherwise would have been required for the development~~, considering all of the lots within the PCD boundaries as a single lot.

~~G~~H. Exceptions to Standards.

 1. Portions of a project ~~within downtown~~ may exceed the floor area ratio permitted in the zone or zones in which the PCD is located, but the ~~floor area ratio of~~maximum chargeable floor area allowed for the PCD as a whole shall meet the requirements of the zone or zones in which it is located. ~~Floor area may be transferred from a portion of a PCD in a non-downtown zone to a portion of a PCD in a downtown zone. When floor area from a portion of a PCD in a non-downtown zone is transferred to a lot in a downtown zone within the PCD project's boundary, the amount of floor area which may be transferred shall be calculated based upon the FAR and lot area of the portion of the PCD in the non-downtown zone by the. However, the FAR used shall not exceed the base FAR of the portion of the PCD in the downtown zone to which the floor area is being transferred.~~

 Section 39. Section 23.49.041 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 120443, is hereby repealed, except for Map 23.49.041A, which is renamed Exhibit 23.49.056 F and made part of Section 23.49.056 as amended by this ordinance.

 Section 40. Subchapter I of Chapter 23.49 is amended to add the following new section:

 23.49.041 Combined lot development.

 When authorized by the Director pursuant to this section, lots located on the same block in DOC1 or DOC2 zones, or in DMC zones with a maximum FAR of ten (10), or lots zoned DOC1 and DMC on the same block, may be combined, whether contiguous or not, solely for the purpose of allowing some or all of the capacity for chargeable floor area on one such lot under this chapter to be used on one or more other lots, according to the following provisions:

 A. Up to all of the capacity on one lot, referred to in this section as the "sending lot," for chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR, pursuant to Section 23.49.011 (referred to in this section as "bonus capacity"), may be used on one or more other lots, subject to compliance with all conditions to use of such bonus capacity, pursuant to Sections 23.49.011-.014, as modified in this Section. For purposes of applying any conditions related to amenities or features provided on site under Section 23.49.013, only the lot or lots on which such bonus capacity shall be used are considered to be the lot or site using a bonus. Criteria for use of bonus that apply to the structure or structures shall be applied only to the structure(s) on the lots using the transferred bonus capacity.

 B. Only if all of the bonus capacity on one lot shall be used on other lots pursuant to this section, there may also be transferred from the sending lot, to one or more such other lots, up to all of the unused base FAR on the sending lot, without regard to limits on the transfer or on use of TDR in Section 23.49.014. Such transfer shall be treated as a transfer of TDR for purposes of determining remaining development capacity on the sending lot and TDR available to transfer under SMC 23.49.014, but shall be treated as additional base FAR on the other lots, and to the extent so treated shall not qualify such lots for bonus development. If less than all of the bonus capacity of the sending lot shall be used on such other lots, then unused base FAR on the sending lot still may be transferred to the extent permitted for within-block TDR under Section 23.49.014, and if the sending lot qualifies for transfer of TDR under any other category of sending lot in Chart 23.49.014A, such unused base FAR may be transferred to the extent permitted for such category, but in each case only to satisfy in part the conditions to use of bonus capacity, not as additional base FAR.

 C. To the extent permitted by the Director, the maximum chargeable floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum chargeable floor area under Section 23.49.011 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development. To the extent permitted by the Director, and subject to subsection B of this section, the base floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum base chargeable floor area under Section 23.49.011 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development.

 D. The Director shall allow combined lot development only to the extent that the Director determines, in a Type I land use decision, that permitting more chargeable floor area than would otherwise be allowed on a lot shall result in a significant public benefit. In addition to features for which floor area bonuses are granted, the Director may also consider the following as public benefits that could satisfy this condition when provided for as a result of the lot combination:

 1. preservation of a landmark structure located on the block or adjacent blocks;

 2. uses serving the downtown residential community, such as a grocery store, at appropriate locations;

 3. public facilities serving the Downtown population, including schools, parks, community centers, human service facilities, and clinics;

 4. transportation facilities promoting pedestrian circulation and transit use, including through block pedestrian connections, transit stations and bus layover facilities;

 5. Short-term parking on blocks within convenient walking distance of the retail core or other Downtown business areas where the amount of available short term parking is determined to be insufficient;

 6. a significant amount of housing serving households with a range of income levels;

 7. improved massing of development on the block that achieves a better relationship with surrounding conditions, including: better integration with adjacent development, greater compatibility with an established scale of development, especially relative to landmark structures, or improved conditions for adjacent public open spaces, designated green streets, or other special street environments;

 8. public view protection within an area; and/or

 9. arts and cultural facilities, including a museum or museum expansion space.

 E. The fee owners of each of the combined lots shall execute an appropriate agreement or instrument, which shall include the legal descriptions of each lot and shall be recorded in the King County real property records. In the agreement or instrument, the owners shall acknowledge the extent to which development capacity on each sending lot is reduced by the use of such capacity on another lot or lots, at least for so long as the chargeable floor area for which such capacity is used remains on such other lot or lots. The deed or instrument shall also provide that its covenants and conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and by the City of Seattle.

 F. Nothing in this Section shall allow the development on any lot in a combined lot development to exceed or deviate from height limits or other development standards.

 Section 41. The following subsections of Section 23.49.042 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 118672, are amended as follows:

 23.49.042 Downtown Office Core 1, Downtown Office Core 2, and Downtown Mixed Commercial permitted uses.

The provisions of this section apply in DOC1, DOC2 and DMC zones.

* * *

 (2) On lots smaller than ten thousand seven hundred (10,700) square feet that are bounded on all sides by street right-of-way, the maximum facade width shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet.

 b. In DOC1 and DOC2 zones, the maximum facade width for portions of a building above eight-five (85) feet along the general north/south axis of a site (parallel to the Avenues) shall be one hundred forty-five (145) feet.

 c. the maximum width of tower structures may be increased if lot is combined with one (1) or more abutting lots, whether occupied by existing structures or not, provided that:

 (1). All lots have frontage on the same street;

 (2). Any existing structure does not exceed a height of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet;

 (3). The coverage and spacing of both the proposed and any existing structures meets the limits established in this Section; and

 (4). The fee owners of the abutting lot(s) execute and record a covenant that restricts future development on the abutting lot to a maximum height of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet for the life of the proposed structure; and that precludes the use of the abutting lot(s) in combination with any other lots for purposes of meeting the requirements of this section.

 d. The projection of unenclosed decks and balconies, and architectural features such as cornices, shall be disregarded in calculating the maximum width of a facade.

 E. Tower spacing for all structures over 160 feet in height in those DMC zoned areas specified below:

 b. from a structure on the same block that is not located in a DMC zone; or

 c. from a structure allowed pursuant to the Land Use Code in effect prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection E, in the DMC 240'/290-400' zone located between Stewart Street, Union Street, Third Avenue and First Avenue, if any part of a tower exceeds one hundred sixty (160) feet in height, then all portions of the tower that are above one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet in height shall be separated by a minimum of two hundred (200) feet from any portion of any other existing tower above one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet in height.

 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection E, on DMC zoned sites with maximum height limits of more than one hundred sixty (160) feet located in the Belltown Urban Center Village, as shown on Exhibit 23.49.058E, if any part of a tower exceeds one hundred sixty (160) feet in height, then all portions of the tower that are above one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet in height must be separated by a minimum of eighty (80) feet from any portion of any other existing tower above one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet in height.

 4.

 5. The projection of unenclosed decks and balconies, and architectural features such as cornices, shall be disregarded in calculating tower separation.

 6. If the presence of an existing tower would preclude the addition of another tower proposed on the same block, as a special exception, the Director may waive or modify the tower spacing requirements of this section to allow a maximum

 of two towers to be located on the same block that are not separated by at least the mimimum spacing required in subsections E2, E3 and E4, other than towers described in subsection E1. The Director shall determine that issues raised in the design review process related to the presence of the additional tower have been adequately addressed before granting any exceptions to tower spacing standards. The Director shall consider the following factors in determining whether such an exception shall be granted:

a. potential impact of the additional tower on adjacent residential structures, located within the same block and on adjacent blocks, in terms of views, privacy, and shadows;

b. potential public benefits that offset the impact of the reduction in required separation between towers, including the provision of public open space, designated green street or other streetscape improvements, preservation of landmark structures, and provision of neighborhood commercial services, such as a grocery store, or community services, such as a community center or school;

c. potential impact on the public environment, including shadow and view impacts on nearby streets and public open spaces;

d. design characteristics of the additional tower in terms of overall bulk and massing, facade treatments and transparency, visual interest, and other features that may offset impacts related to the reduction in required separation between towers;  e. the City's goal of encouraging residential development downtown; and

 f. the feasibility of developing the site without an exception from the tower spacing requirement.

 7. For purposes of this section, an "existing" tower is either:

 (a) a tower that is physically present, except as provided below in this subsection E6, or

 (b) a proposed tower for which a Master Use Permit decision that includes approval of the Design Review element has been issued, unless and until either (i) the Master Use Permit issued pursuant to such decision expires or is cancelled, or the related application is withdrawn by the applicant, without the tower having been constructed; or (ii) a ruling by a hearing examiner or court of competent jurisdiction

reversing or vacating such decision, or determining such decision or the Master Use Permit issued thereunder to be invalid, becomes final and no longer subject to judicial review.  A tower that is physically present shall not be considered "existing" if the owner of the lot where such tower is located shall have applied to the Director for a permit to demolish such tower and such application shall be pending or a permit issued for such demolition shall be in effect, but any permit decision or permit for any structure that would not be permitted under this section if such tower were considered "existing" may be conditioned upon the actual demolition of such tower.

 F. Upper Level Setbacks

1. When a lot in a DMC zone is across a street from the Pike Place Market Historical District as shown on Map 1K, a continuous upper-level setback of fifteen (15) feet shall be provided on all street frontages across from the Historical District above a height of sixty-five (65) feet.

2. When a lot in a DMC or DOC2 zone is located on a designated green street, a continuous upper-level setback of fifteen (15) feet shall be provided on the street frontage abutting the green street at a height of forty-five (45) feet.

 ATTACHMENT 3 INTRODUCTION

 Downtown Amenity Features and Standards

 The standards in this document supplement provisions in the Downtown chapter of the Land Use Code related to the amenity features that can help a project qualify for a floor area bonus or that are exempt from the definition of chargeable floor area. These features are listed below under general categories related to the function and public purpose each is intended to serve.

 * Interior Amenities Hillclimb Assist Museum Public Atrium Public Restrooms

 * Open Space Amenities Commercial parcel park Green street parcel park Residential parcel park

 * Retail-related Amenities Major retail store Shopping atrium Shopping corridor

 * Streetscape and Circulation-related Amenities Green Street Improvement Green Street Setback Hillside Terrace Urban Plaza

 * Transit-related Amenities Transit Station Access Easement Transit Station Access: Grade Level Transit Station Access: Mechanical

 * Other Amenities Human Services Restoration and Preservation of Landmark Performing Arts Theatre

 Contents

 In some Downtown zones, increases in chargeable floor area above the base Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of the zone may be allowed as bonus development or by the use of transferable development rights (TDR), or both, subject to specified conditions. (See Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.49.011-.014).

 These standards address all the amenity features that may be provided for floor area increases allowed above the Base FAR. Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 23.49 establishes the features eligible for a bonus in each zone, with the bonus ratio and other conditions and limits governing the floor area that may be obtained for each feature. These standards also address the amenity features that may be exempted from chargeable floor area as provided in SMC 23.49.011.

 These standards supplement the provisions of the Land Use Code with additional, detailed criteria that the Department of Planning and Development shall use in the review of proposed amenity features to determine whether a floor area bonus or exemption will be allowed for such features. These standards include requirements for the ongoing operation of amenity features, which apply to the successor owners and operators of the buildings using the bonuses.

 The Downtown Amenity Standards are presented in the following three parts:

 Part I General Eligibility Conditions for Amenity Features.

 This part focuses on the procedures, operations, mandatory features, maintenance, identification, and leasing requirements generally associated with bonusable amenity features and amenity features that are eligible for a floor area exemption. Some conditions apply to all amenity features, such as hours that they must remain open to the public, while others apply only to specific amenity features, such as requirements for active street level uses. These general conditions must be satisfied for the feature to qualify for a bonus, unless an exception is expressly granted by the Director.

 Part II Specific Eligibility Conditions and Guidelines for Bonusable Amenity Features.

 This section of the document part provides the basis for reviewing each bonusable amenity feature, stating the intended function and public benefit of each feature and setting forth eligibility conditions and guidelines.

 * Specific Eligibility Conditions. Eligibility conditions represent basic requirements in addition to any set forth in the Land Use Code -primarily related to the location and size of the feature-that must be met for a floor area bonus to be granted.

 * Guidelines. The guidelines are more flexible statements about the characteristics desired for each amenity feature. They provide direction for the siting and design of a feature, while allowing flexibility to respond to the special circumstances of individual projects and development sites.

 Part III Specific Eligibility Conditions and Guidelines for Amenity Features Eligible for Floor Area Exemption Only.

 This section of the document contains specific eligibility conditions and guidelines for exemption of certain amenity features from the definition of chargeable floor area.

 Relationship of Downtown Amenity Standards to Other Downtown Codes/Policies

 Relationship to Design Review Guidelines: Most if not all projects using TDR or floor area bonuses for public amenities are required to go through the City's Design Review Program as established by SMC Chapter 23.41. Further information about design review is in Client Assistance Memo 238 and the Design review web page at www.seattle.gov/designreview. Except for the Design Review Guidelines, such information is unofficial.

 The Design Review Program involves public meetings early on in the process with the Design Review Board (DRB). DPD uses the DRB to recommend priority guidelines for each project from the 21 adopted Guidelines for Downtown Development, April 1999. These Guidelines cover Site Planning, Architectural Expression, The Street Facade, Public Amenities and Vehicular Access and Parking. The Board also makes recommendations to DPD regarding departures from the Land Use development standards and may be requested by DPD to make recommendations on any requested modifications to "eligibility conditions" for the public amenity standards in order to assist the DPD staff in reaching a decision on such modifications.

 As part of the review of the proposed amenities, the Director of DPD may consider comments from the Design Review Board to inform recommendations to DPD regarding the quality of the proposed amenities.

 The analysis of how the public amenities and FAR incentives proposed meet the criteria of the Code and Downtown Amenity Standards will be included in the Master Use Permit (MUP) decision by DPD. If there are requests for departures from eligibility conditions, the MUP decision will describe the proposed departures, analyze the rationale for them, summarize input received from other City departments and/or the Design Review Board, and state the Director's determination, including any conditions to allowance of departures.

 Modification of provisions for public amenity features. Pursuant to SMC Section 23.49.013, the Director has the authority to grant departures from Eligibility Conditions. In some instances there are specified criteria in these Standards for particular types of departures. DPD staff may present the analysis of requested departures to the DRB as part of the recommendation phase of the DR/MUP process for the DRB's input on the decision by the DPD director.

 I: GENERAL ELIGIBILITY CONDITIONS FOR AMENITY FEATURES

Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature

 gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, the building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others.

 C. Maintenance

 Unless otherwise stated in the specific conditions for a public amenity feature, the property owner shall maintain all elements of bonused features, including but not limited to landscaping, seating and lighting, in a safe, clean, and well-maintained condition.

 D. Combination of Features

 Projects using the floor area bonus system may incorporate several public amenity features, within the limits established by the Land Use Code. The intent is to encourage the integration of various features within a project design. Should conflicts among requirements arise when combining public amenity features in one project, the Director may resolve the conflict by granting departures from eligibility conditions, provided the intent of each feature is fulfilled.

 E. Art In Bonused Public Spaces

 1. Definition: For the purposes of this ordinance, art shall be broadly defined to encourage high-quality, imaginative interpretations of the various media, and shall include works that are merely decorative, or are both decorative and functional. Over time, new materials and art forms may be developed. Therefore, such innovations in form and media are included in this definition of art.

 2. Amenities Requiring Art: To make a positive contribution to the identity of the public space, artwork is required in the following amenity features:

 a. Commercial, Residential, and Green Street Parcel Parks b. Green Street Improvement c. Hillclimb Assist d. Hillside Terrace e. Public Atrium f. Shopping Corridor g. Transit Station Access h. Urban Plaza

 3. General Requirements

 a. When more than one of the listed bonused public spaces is incorporated in a project, the requirement for artwork may be filled in a variety of ways, such as providing one major work as a focal point, or several smaller works, as appropriate to the design of the public spaces, and commensurate with the amount of bonused public space.

 b. Artwork may include but need not be limited to two or three dimensional works in all media, such as oil or acrylic on canvas, textiles, photography, ceramics, wood, paper, metal, stone, etc. Artwork may also include fountains, mobiles, special wall or paving surfaces, bas-reliefs, mosaics, murals, landscaping elements, and other decorative features. Interdisciplinary projects and collaborations are encouraged, as are works that are not only visual, but engage other senses, such as sound and touch.

 c. The artwork shall be clearly visible to people using the public space, and, wherever possible, should be visible from the street. If it is not visible from the street, it shall be visible from primary circulation paths adjacent to or through the public space. However, it shall not impede circulation in the open space.

 d. The setting for the artwork shall be designed to provide comfort and amenity and accommodate people viewing the art by incorporating such features as steps, ledges, benches, and other seating or by providing rails or other architectural features to lean against.

 e. The property owner is responsible for the maintenance of all art features for the life of the building.

 f. The selection of artists to work as members of design teams along with building architects, landscape architects and/or engineers is encouraged. The intent is to promote art that is an integral part of the design of the public space and compatible in bulk, scale, design, texture, color, and shape with the space in which it is located.

 4. Artwork Plan Process

 a. To encourage integration of the artwork into the overall design of the project, the Master Use Permit application shall include a Preliminary Artwork Plan which shall be submitted to the Seattle Arts Commission who will review it, advise the applicant and the DPD Director, and make recommendations on the proposal. The Preliminary Artwork Plan shall include the following elements:

 * Concept Statement - Outline of the art proposal in terms of proposed location(s) and type(s) of art, e.g., sculpture, two- dimensional work, interdisciplinary process, etc.

 * Proposed budget

 * Proposed process for selection of artist(s)

 * Schedule for implementation

 b. Before a building permit for the project is issued, a final Artwork Plan shall be submitted by the applicant to the Seattle Arts

 Commission, who will review it and make recommendations to the DPD Director. The Final Artwork Plan shall be a refinement of the Preliminary Artwork Plan, and include the following elements:

 * Selected Artist(s)

 * Drawings indicating location, size, placement of artwork

 * Technical documents outlining in detail the materials and method of attachment of the proposed art

 * Maintenance, safety and security considerations

 * Final budget

 * Final schedule for installations

 c. The final Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued until the artwork is complete and installed.

 5. Removal or Modification of Art in Bonused Spaces

 a. Proposed alterations to or removal of artwork in bonused public spaces may be subject to the Visual Artists Rights Act. Therefore, such alteration or removal shall require review by the Seattle Arts Commission. The Commission will advise the DPD Director if, in its opinion, the proposed alterations would constitute destruction of the artwork, and would thus require replacement artwork to satisfy the bonus requirements. The Director may require replacement artwork.

 b. Proposals for replacement artwork in bonused public spaces shall be reviewed by the Seattle Arts Commission, who will make a recommendation to the DPD Director. The recommendations will be based on the applicability of the new artwork, taking into account the original Final Artwork Plan and any changed conditions since the original installation of the artwork. The Director may approve, condition or deny the placement of the replacement artwork.

 F. Landscaping and Furnishing

 1. Amenities Requiring Landscaping: To be eligible for a bonus or floor area exemption, landscaping is required for the following amenity features, consistent with the applicable guidelines specified for each feature in Part II:

The seating may be either permanent or movable. Additional seating, and/or tables, may be reserved for customers of restaurants or other uses. To avoid dominating the space and conflicting with its intended public use, the area reserved for such seating should not exceed 15 percent of the bonused area, or 500 square feet, whichever is less. The location, size and delineation of the area used for reserved seating is subject to the review and approval of the Director.

 b. Perimeter walls. Non-transparent perimeter walls, excluding windows, should be decoratively finished or lined with continuous planting to a minimum height of about one story, or to the top of the wall(s), whichever is less. Exterior perimeter walls should be light in color to reflect light into outdoor open spaces.

 c. Temporary features. Temporary kiosks, displays, art exhibits and retail stalls may be permitted, provided they are portable and do not restrict public access and use of the park or restrict pedestrian circulation.

 G. Safety

 1. To increase public safety and security, public open spaces shall be designed to avoid creation of isolated areas, and to maintain lines of sight into the space from streets and major pedestrian walkways whenever possible.

 a. Landscaping: Trees and shrubs shall be planted and maintained so as to avoid public safety problems that could arise when vegetation interferes with normal lines of sight or negates the effects of nighttime security lighting.

 b. Lighting: Lighting shall be provided in bonused public open spaces that are required to be accessible at night and adequate lighting shall be provided along street edges of bonused features.

 H. Identification

 Each bonused public space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and

 additional directional information as needed.

 A. Hillclimb Assist

 Hillclimb assists facilitate pedestrian movement in steeply sloping areas with high concentrations of employment and heavy pedestrian traffic.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Continuous and direct route: The hillclimb assist must provide a continuous direct route across the block connecting parallel Avenues.

 2. Accessibility: The assist corridor must be accessible from the street or from a public open space that opens directly onto the sidewalk. Access to the corridor shall be at the same grade level as the sidewalk or a public open space that provides access to the sidewalk level without requiring the use of stairs. Any change in elevation shall be accommodated by ramps or gradual level changes in the floor of the open space.

 3. Mechanical feature: The hillclimb assist shall incorporate a mechanical feature, such as an escalator, for conveying pedestrians up at least eighty percent of the vertical distance between the elevations of the two avenues it connects. The mechanical feature shall be in operation during the normal operating hours of the building.

 4. Independent system: The mechanical conveyance of the assist shall be independent of the main internal circulation system of the project. Elevators do not qualify as the required conveyance, although a supplementary assist providing access for the physically disabled may be part of the internal circulation system of the building.

 Guidelines

 1. Area and dimensions: The hillclimb assist corridor should comfortably accommodate heavy volumes of pedestrians and be aligned and designed to visually communicate that a direct passageway is provided across the site for use by the general public.

 a. Excluding mechanical conveyances, the minimum clear dimensions of the corridor connecting the Avenues should be approximately twelve feet wide and approximately ten feet high for any covered portion of the corridor.

 b. Most of the travel path between Avenues should be covered to provide protection from inclement weather. Covering of the corridor outside the principal structure should be transparent.

 2. Street orientation: Through the location of access points and orientation on the block, integrate the hillclimb assist with pedestrian circulation patterns in the surrounding area. Promote maximum pedestrian use by providing a direct, visible path across the lot logically aligned to link with the local pedestrian network.

 a. Align the assist with other through-block assists or existing pedestrian crosswalks, and, whenever possible, link with transit stations to develop an integrated network of pedestrian routes and assists.

 b. Consider major pedestrian destinations in the surrounding area to orient hillclimb corridors with likely paths of pedestrian movement.

 3. Access: Entrances to the assist should be clearly visible, inviting and directly accessible from the street.

 a. Access points may be completely open or may be enclosed with clear, transparent doors and glazing. Identification of public access to the assist should be prominently displayed.

 b. The minimum height of access points within a structure should be approximately twelve feet, and the minimum width approximately 15 feet.

 4. Landscaping and furnishings: Required landscaping within the assist corridor, including artwork, should enhance the space without conflicting with pedestrian movement. The major feature of the hillclimb assist is the mechanical conveyance, which should be visually prominent. Wherever possible, opportunities for views from the assist should be considered in the design and siting of the assist route.

 a. At a minimum, approximately fifteen percent of the area of the hillclimb assist corridor should be landscaped, excluding the area occupied by the mechanical conveyance.

 b. Provide seating along the hillclimb assist corridor, with approximately one lineal foot of seating for every 30 square feet of bonusable area..

 5. Natural lighting: To enhance the quality of the space and avoid a

 tunnel effect, the corridor should have as much access to natural light as possible. At a minimum, approximately one quarter of the length of the corridor should have access to natural light, either through transparent covering, windows and/or skylights.

 B. Public Atrium

 Public atriums provide weather protected spaces within concentrated employment areas for passive recreation, as well as events and public gatherings that are best accommodated indoors. Atriums are appropriate for Seattle's climate because they provide an alternative to outdoor public spaces during inclement weather, and, when integrated with transit stations, provide protected public space for the comfort and convenience of transit riders.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Location: To ensure strategic locations in relation to the street environment and other public amenities, lots eligible for a public atrium bonus must be approved by the Director according to the following criteria:

 a. Public atriums are limited to locations where they will reinforce the use of nearby open spaces and not detract from activity in streets and other outdoor public areas, or where they will enhance conditions for transit riders around high volume transit stations or stops.

 b. Only one atrium per block is eligible for a bonus, unless the Director determines that, because the atrium serves a transit station or major transfer point or is integrated with another amenity feature that generates a high volume of pedestrian activity, such as a hillclimb assist, there will be sufficient activity to support the additional indoor space.

 2. Minimum size: To provide sufficient space to accommodate intended functions, the minimum area of an atrium shall be 2,000 square feet.

 3. Accessibility and visibility: The indoor space of the atrium shall be directly accessible and visible from the street or from a public bonus feature providing direct access to the street. The Director may waive these requirements for atriums integrated with transit stations, provided that, if the space is at a grade substantially above or below street level, it is connected to the street by a mechanical assist, the path to the atrium is direct and clearly marked, and the atrium is open to the public during hours of transit system operation.

 4. Natural lighting: To improve the quality of the space, support interior landscaping, and increase the overall sense of spaciousness, access to natural light is required as a major feature of the atrium. The Director shall use the following guidelines for requiring skylights or clerestory windows, alone or in combination, to ensure sufficient access to natural light:

 a. At least half of the roof of the space is open to the sky except for a covering of transparent or translucent material. Systems allowing the space to be open to the sky in good weather are

 desirable; or

 b. A minimum of half the perimeter of the atrium has clerestory windows at least eight feet in height; or

 c. A combination of skylights and clerestory windows, or similar features, admits ample light.

 Where glass walls or skylights are exposed to direct sunlight, heat loss/gain may be controlled by overhangs, mechanical venting or mechanically operating shading devices, such as blinds. Such mechanical systems shall be specified in the application and a program for their operation included.

 For atriums integrated with transit stations, since the space may be below grade, the Director may waive provisions for transparent perimeter walls.

 5. Public restrooms: Public restroom facilities are required at a location easily accessible to the atrium, with directional signs placed in the atrium.

 Guidelines

 1. Area and dimensions: The atrium should be arranged as one large, contiguous space with horizontal and vertical dimensions sufficient to create a sense of openness while providing flexible space adaptable to a variety of activities.

 a. The minimum horizontal dimension unobstructed by any permanent feature over three feet in height should be approximately 30 feet.

 b. The height of the atrium should be generous, with most of the bonusable area at least two stories in height.

 c. The elevation of the atrium floor should generally be level, but may vary, provided that grade changes are gradual and do not significantly disrupt the continuity of the space.

 2. Street orientation: While frontage on high volume pedestrian and transit corridors is desirable, the length of the atrium's street frontage should be minimized to avoid disruption of street level activity.

 a. Maximize the transparency of atrium facades abutting a street or public open space.

 b. The treatment of street frontages should be consistent with applicable street facade development standards.

 c. Frontage on a Class I Pedestrian Street should generally not exceed 60 feet.

 d. On street frontages where street level uses are required, the atrium space should be separated from the street with street level uses as much as possible while still maintaining clear, direct access to the space from the street.

 3. Access: The space should be designed as a functionally independent area within the building, separate from the building lobby. However, it should be visible and directly accessible from the lobby and major internal circulation routes.

 a. If integrated with a hillclimb assist, access from the assist should be at the same level as a landing along the assist route.

 b. The atrium space should be directly accessible, with minimal change of grade, from a prominent entrance on an abutting street or public open space.

 4. Landscaping and furnishing: Incorporate landscaping and required art into the design of the space to enhance comfort and aesthetic quality, while also accommodating flexible use. The design of the atrium should be conducive to temporary arts events and gatherings and should include electrical outlets, open areas for performers or exhibits, and seating.

 a. Design of the space should encourage a range of activities determined to be of a public benefit, such as designing the atrium floor to serve as amphitheater seating for public entertainment.

 b. Approximately one lineal foot of seating should be provided for every 30 square feet of bonusable area.

 5. Limits on retail use: The amount of retail space accessible inside the atrium should be limited to prevent the space from assuming a retail character that detracts from outdoor street activity. However, the treatment of the atrium's street frontages should minimize interruptions in the continuity of street-oriented retail activity by including retail space, which may or may not have access to the atrium.

 C. Public Restrooms

 Public restrooms enhance the public environment Downtown by providing for the comfort and convenience of pedestrians.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Use and Access: Public restrooms eligible for a bonus are rooms, separated by gender, containing toilets and lavatories for the use of the general public. For purposes of personal safety, limited control of access shall be allowed, such as required use of a key, provided that an attendant is available to ensure access. If access to the public restroom is monitored by a person located at the restroom facility during the normal operating hours of the building in which the restroom is located, separation by gender is not required.

 2. Location: To serve the general public, the location of bonused public restrooms must be easily recognizable and accessible from either the street or other public areas. Public restrooms must be directly accessible from either the street, from

 a. an outdoor public area directly accessible from the street, from an outdoor public area easily accessible from the street, or from

 interior public spaces that qualify as bonusable public benefit features.

 b. Public restrooms may be located above or below street level if they are directly accessible from:

 i. public areas providing connections to transportation facilities located above or below grade, such as transit station mezzanines, or

 ii. bonusable interior public spaces, such as public atriums, that may include public areas above or below street level. These areas must meet ADA accessibility standards.

 c. The location of public restrooms shall be designated by signs sufficient to enable pedestrians on abutting streets or public open spaces to readily locate them.

 d. Access to public restrooms may be monitored by a person located at the restroom facility. Where such an attendant is available to provide access, restroom facilities may be locked when not in use.

 e. The Director may determine that public restrooms directly accessible from building lobbies qualify for a bonus, provided that signage visible from the street indicates the presence of the restroom facility, and clear and direct access is provided.

 f. The Director may allow restrooms serving the street level uses of a project to qualify for a bonus if signage clearly visible from the street is provided to indicate availability for general public use.

 3. Hours of operation: Public restrooms shall be open to the general public during the hours that the structure is open to the general public. If access is provided from a public benefit feature that receives a floor area bonus, the restroom shall remain open during the time of required access to the bonused feature.

 4. Special conditions: Public restrooms shall be maintained by the owner of the structure for the life of the structure that includes the bonused space.

 D. Parcel Park

 Parcel parks are small open spaces adaptable to a wide variety of site conditions and open space needs. Their design and character vary in response to the different open space functions they serve in different Downtown environments. To provide amenities best suited to varying needs and locations, three types of parcel parks are eligible for floor area bonuses, including: 1) commercial parcel parks, 2) residential parcel parks, and 3) Green Street parcel parks.

 * Commercial parcel parks provide protected enclaves of open space designed as quiet retreats to provide enclosure and refuge from surrounding activity in high density employment and mixed use areas. While relatively small open spaces, through flexible design, passive recreational activities as well as temporary events and small public gatherings can be accommodated, with some retail activity to serve those using the space.

 * Residential parcel parks reinforce the residential character of Downtown neighborhoods and provide landscaped public space for residents to engage in passive and active recreational activities.

 * Green Street parcel parks expand the amount of public open space along an abutting designated Green Street, thereby increasing the open space value of these amenities. Because Green Streets are quieter streets with relatively low traffic volumes and a greater pedestrian orientation, abutting parcel parks need not provide the same level of enclosure and sense of refuge desired for Commercial Parcel Parks at other locations.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Space Size, Configuration, and Features: For all types of parcel

 parks, the area eligible for a bonus shall be one contiguous space, with elements such as landscaping, fountains, seating and public art counted as part of the contiguous space. In addition, the following conditions apply:

 a. A parcel park must have a minimum area of 3,000 square feet.

 b. Except on designated Green Streets, only one parcel park is eligible for a bonus on a block front, unless the Director determines an additional parcel park can be designed and integrated as an extension of an existing parcel park. A maximum of two parcel parks are eligible for a bonus on any individual lot. Green Street parcel parks are bonusable on any lot abutting a designated Green Street.

 2. Allowable Departures: To accommodate transit station access and to account for the different relationship required between the street level and the level of a parcel park, the Director may allow departure from these standards to ensure that access to the transit station is well integrated with the open space, and that the open space functions as intended.

 Guidelines

 1. Area and dimensions: Parcel parks should be large enough to accommodate a variety of activities and small gatherings of users while also providing more intimate spaces for retreat from activity.

 a. accessible and best suited to accommodating the parks intended function.

 b. The area of the principal space should be at least 2,000 square feet, or 60 percent of the total park area, whichever is greater.

 c. No dimension of the principal space should be less than 30 feet.

 d. In general, the principal space should be:

 i. directly accessible from the sidewalk,

 ii. within approximately three feet of average sidewalk grade at the primary entrance to the park, (exceptions may be appropriate for steeply sloping streets in the office core)

 iii. no further from the sidewalk than the width of the access to the park, and

 iv. a level surface, except with grade changes required for drainage.

 e. The accessory spaces of the park accommodate complementary activities in a more flexible manner and may be at different levels from the principal space and from each other, as long as they are physically and visually connected.

 2. Street orientation and relationship to adjacent development: Parcel parks should be highly visible from adjacent sidewalks and public areas and directly and easily accessible to abutting streets.

 a. Parcel parks should be sited or designed to prevent topography from presenting a significant barrier to public access.

 b. Parcel park locations should maximize direct or reflected solar access and increase light and air to the public street environment. Preferable locations are south of tower development and where the siting of the park would improve solar access to the sidewalk.

 c. To promote safety and security, residential parcel parks should be located where they can be seen and actively used by nearby residents. Because these spaces are intended for more localized public use, locations on neighborhood Green Streets or within residential "enclaves" are most desirable, while locations on principal transit streets identified on Map 1B of the Downtown Section of the Land Use Code are less desirable

 d. The siting and design of parcel parks should minimize interruptions to street level activity and the physical continuity of the street wall, especially along streets where heavy pedestrian traffic is anticipated and/or active street level uses are required. For the purposes of this guideline, street frontage shall be the maximum width of the parcel park measured parallel to the street, projected to the street property line, Figure A.

[Figure A](/~ordpics/115524a3_1.gif)

 i. On Class I Pedestrian Streets, parcel parks should be oriented to minimize interruptions to street level uses. The total opening to the street of any parcel park should generally be less than the depth of the park measured perpendicular to the street property line, Figure B.

 Figure B [Figure B](/~ordpics/115524a3_2.gif)

 ii. Where street level uses are required, the width of street openings should be further minimized to generally no more than forty feet by separating areas of the park from the sidewalk by a structure(s) containing required street level uses. However, for parcel parks with frontage on Green Streets, no separation is needed if the required uses are located within about 40 feet of the property line of the abutting designated Green Street and are easily accessible from the Green Street.

 e. Corner locations are generally less desirable for commercial parcel parks because of the potential for eroding a well defined streetscape and interrupting the continuity of street level activity.

 However, in some situations, a corner location may be optimal in terms of solar exposure or for other reasons. To protect the integrity of the streetscape, on corners where property line street walls are required on both streets, parcel parks should be enclosed by structural elements provided along the street edges, except at access points, consistent with the street wall requirements established in the Land Use Code. Access to commercial parcel parks at corner locations should generally be at least 30 feet from any intersecting street, with a structural element, such as a retail pavilion, placed at the corner.

 f. To add interest and increase the security of the space, the design of the walls, uses, colonnade, or other elements separating a parcel park from the street to provide enclosure should ensure that the interior park space is highly visible from the street.

 g. Transparent materials or openings to permit views and light should be used on walls enclosing any parcel park along street property lines. When a parcel park is separated from the street by a structure containing retail uses, the structure should meet the street facade requirements, except height, for the zone in which the park is located.

 3. Treatment of required active street-level use: Required active street level uses should be convenient to park users and add interest and activity to the space. Where active street level uses are required, at least twenty percent of the perimeter of the parcel park should be occupied by active street level uses having direct access

 to the park.

 4. Access

 a. Parcel parks should be directly accessible from the sidewalk or another public open space, and should be highly visible from the street.

 b. Parcel parks should not serve primarily as a forecourt to a project's principal entrance. When a parcel park is located between the street and the principal building entrance, pedestrian access to the development should not disrupt the passive nature of the park. The path from the street to the project entrance should be located to the edge of the park, and an area along this path approximately fifteen feet wide should not be bonused.

 c Where the street frontage exceeds forty feet on more than one street, access generally should be provided from both streets.

 d. Through siting and design, residential parcel parks on lots with housing should complement and be well integrated with the residential use, taking advantage of the added security of having "eyes" on the space, while also promoting access and use by the general public.

 5. Landscaping and furnishings: To provide relief from the "hardscape" of the surrounding urban environment, parcel parks should provide sufficient greenery, including trees, to give the space a strong, landscaped character. In addition to reinforcing the desired function of different types of parcel parks, landscaping and furnishings, including required art, should lend identity and interest to the space and provide for the comfort of park users. Design elements such as walls, structures containing retail uses, low planters or benches, and seating should be used as appropriate to minimize interruptions in the street wall and breaks in retail activity.

 a. Commercial Parcel Park. The landscaping and design of commercial parcel parks should enhance the feeling of intimacy and quiet. Along with other design elements of the space, landscaping should provide enclosure, and minimize disruption to the street wall and street level activity. Approximately one lineal foot of seating should be provided for every 30 square feet of bonusable area.

 b. Residential Parcel Park. The design and landscaping of residential parcel parks, should introduce greenery into the neighborhood, while allowing for flexible use of the space to accommodate recreational activities of the nearby residential population. Approximately one lineal foot of seating should be provided for every 60 square feet of bonusable area.

 c. Green Street Parcel Park. The design and landscaping of Green Street parcel parks should reinforce the concept plan for the abutting Green Street, if one exists, or otherwise ensure integration of the space with the Green Street. The Director should evaluate the status of design for the abutting Green Street to determine the appropriate landscaping for the abutting park area. Where a design concept plan is not available to guide landscaping decisions, the Director should consider the intended use of the parcel park based on the intended function of the area where it is located and the surrounding development context.

 6. Coverage: All parcel parks should be open to the sky, except that portions may be covered to accommodate activities that complement use of the space and make them more comfortable and usable. This coverage may include retail kiosks or overhead weather protection. While kiosks and temporary overhead weather protection may be located within the principal space, no portion of the principal space should be permanently covered

 E. Shopping Corridor

 Shopping corridors provide weather protected, through-block pedestrian connections with retail frontage to reinforce retail activity and enhance pedestrian circulation in areas of concentrated shopping activity and heavy pedestrian traffic. Shopping corridors expand the pedestrian network in these areas by creating additional "pedestrian streets" through private development that are well integrated with adjacent streets and complement street-oriented retail activity.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Location: Shopping corridors shall be located near the middle of the long, rectangular blocks (360 feet along the Avenue frontage) in the retail core area and shall provide a continuous connection between two Avenues.

 2. Access: Entrances to the corridor must be at the same grade as the sidewalk.

 3. Number of bonused corridors per block: The number of shopping corridors eligible for a bonus shall be limited to two on a block to avoid a significant diversion of pedestrian activity from the street.

 Guidelines

 1. Location: Site shopping corridors to improve pedestrian circulation and provide additional retail frontage without detracting from sidewalk activity.

 a. The shopping corridor should generally not be closer than 120 feet to any parallel street property line, and the minimum distance between corridors should be 60 feet.

 b. Where possible, align shopping corridors with mid-block pedestrian crosswalks or entries to other pedestrian corridors on adjacent blocks to better integrate them with pedestrian circulation patterns.

 2. Area and dimensions: The shopping corridor should provide an apparent and convenient connection between Avenues, as well as a pleasant space for pedestrian movement and shopping. Limit the overall area of the block occupied by corridor space to maximize the amount of street level floor area available for retail use.

 a. The minimum height of the corridor should generally be twelve feet, although additional height for at least portions of the corridor is desirable to prevent a tunnel-like space.

 b. The unobstructed width of the corridor connecting the Avenues should generally be at least 20 feet.

 c. To accommodate pedestrian movement through the block while ensuring easy access to shops on both sides of the corridor, the width of the corridor should not exceed 30 feet.

 3. Access: Shopping corridor entrances should be highly visible from the street, easily accessible, and inviting.

 a. Permit changes in the level of the corridor route to accommodate changes in grade, although avoid level changes that require the use of stairs or mechanical assists.

 b. The height and width of entrances should be prominent to signify the corridor's function as a public access route through the block.

 4. Treatment of required active uses: To ensure the intended retail function, the frontages of the shopping corridor should be occupied by active street level uses similar to conditions established for streets where street level uses are required. These uses should have entrances directly onto the corridor, except that uses abutting a street should also have access to the street.

 5. Facade treatment and furnishings: Design the facades and furnishings of shopping corridors to enhance the shopping environment and increase pedestrian comfort without detracting from the corridor's function as a through-block connection.

 a. Temporary kiosks, displays, art exhibits, and retail use of the corridor space may be permitted provided they don't obstruct the use, access, and circulation through the space by the general public is not obstructed. Temporary structures are those that are movable or designed to be easily dismantled. Any temporary use of the space should not reduce the circulation path to a width less than ten feet.

 b. To promote visual interest and enhance retail activity, transparency and blank walls along shopping corridor walls should be treated similarly to facades along a Class 1 Pedestrian Street.

 6. Natural light: Access to natural light is desirable and should be provided through skylights and/or clerestory windows to prevent a tunnel-like space and to increase the overall quality of the corridor.

 F. Green Street Improvement

 A Green Street improvement implements a portion of the concept plan for the street right-of-way design of a designated Green Street. Such improvements, which might include sidewalk widening, landscaping, traffic calming, street furniture, and pedestrian oriented lighting, enhance the public use of the Green Street right- of-way for pedestrian circulation and open space.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Eligible streets: Green Streets improvements shall be in accordance with the Green Street Director's Rule 11-93. The improvements must be to a designated Green Street abutting or in the vicinity of the lot seeking the bonus, and must be made within a reasonable amount of time, as determined by the Director.

 2. Requirements: The following conditions must be met to ensure an integrated design for the length of the Green Street:

 a. Paving and landscaping improvements and other amenities specified in the Green Street concept plan for the public right-of-way are required along the entire Green Street frontage of the lot, extending to the centerline of the street or other location approved in the Green Street concept plan.

 b. Art shall be incorporated as set forth in Part I.E. The nature of the artwork and locations shall be determined as part of the Green Street review process specified in the Green Street Director's Rule 11-93.

 c. The area of the public right-of-way developed as a Green Street shall remain in the public domain.

 3. Maintenance

 a. All areas separated from the vehicular right-of-way by a curb, and all nonstandard features located between curbs, shall be maintained by the property owner for the life of the project or as specified in the Master Use Permit decision.

 b. On Green Streets without a curb, a determination shall be made regarding the area for which the property owner will assume maintenance responsibility or the amount of reimbursement required to cover the cost to the City or other party for maintaining the area.

 G. Green Street Setback

 A Green Street setback extends the improvements of the public right- of-way area of a designated Green Street onto abutting lots to provide additional space for landscaping and amenities that will enhance the open space character of the Green Street.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Eligibility restriction: Green Street setbacks are not eligible for a bonus on street frontages requiring property line street walls.

 2. Bonusable areas: On designated Green Streets requiring street level setbacks, the required setback area may be included as area eligible for a bonus if the improvement overall meets the required conditions of this Rule.

 3. Size requirements: The intent of this section is that the setback area be of sufficient size to accommodate a variety of landscaping treatments and amenities, but limited in depth to better integrate activity in abutting development with the Green Street.

 a. The minimum setback from the Green Street property line is five feet.

 b. The maximum setback from the street property line of area eligible for a bonus is ten feet.

 c. The Director may modify these standards to provide more usable space or special landscaping treatments within the setback area, especially if such treatments are consistent with a Green Street concept plan.

 4. Configuration: The setback area shall be open to the sky; free and clear of overhead obstructions, except that the Director may allow some encroachments, such as bay windows, balconies, building cornices and other architectural features that add visual interest to the abutting building facades and/or increase the "eyes on the street" by making the Green Street more visible to building occupants.

 Guidelines

 1. Street orientation: Facades facing the setback area along the Green Street should provide visual interest for pedestrians and complement the landscaped treatment of the setback area. Facade design should encourage integration of activities at the ground floor of the abutting structure with the setback area and the Green Street.

 2. Landscaping and furnishings: Provide sufficient landscaping within the setback area to enhance the open space character of the Green Street, and coordinate landscaping, paving and furnishings with improvements in the abutting Green Street right-of-way.

 a. At least 50 percent of the setback area should be landscaped.

 b. Temporary kiosks, displays, art exhibits and retail use of the setback area may be permitted, provided such features are compatible with the Green Street plan.

 c. No more than ten percent of the setback area should be occupied by any temporary use for more than five days.

 d. Permanent coverage of the setback area should not be permitted unless approved as part of the Green Street plan.

 H. Hillside Terrace

 Hillside terraces are open spaces adapted to conditions in steeply sloping downtown areas. They enhance pedestrian movement on steep streets and better integrate development with the street environment on sloping lots. They contribute to a more spacious street environment, and, when located along east/west streets, afford opportunities to expand views to Elliott Bay.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Minimum standards: To provide usable open space, accommodate continuous pedestrian movement along the sloping street, and integrate sidewalk activity with abutting development, the following standards apply:

 a. The minimum frontage of the terrace along the sloping street is one-half block, excluding the alley, if one exists.

 b. The area eligible for a bonus must be one contiguous space, but may be on several different levels; landscaping, fountains, seating and art are considered part of the contiguous space.

 c. Any driveway area crossing the terrace is not bonusable.

 d. The minimum depth of the terrace measured at any point from the street property line is ten feet, Figure A.

[Figure A](/~ordpics/115524a3_3.gif)

 e. The maximum depth of any bonusable terrace area from the street property line is thirty feet.

 2. Transit access: To accommodate transit station access and to

 account for the different relationship required between the street level and the level of the hillside terrace, the Director may allow departure from these standards to ensure that access to the transit station is well integrated with the open space, and that the open space functions as intended.

 Guidelines

 1. Access: Integrate the sidewalk with the project site by designing the hillside terrace to facilitate pedestrian movement up and down the hillside along the sidewalk.

 a. Maximize direct connections across the space from the sidewalk to abutting development and minimize obstructions separating the sidewalk from the terrace.

 b. Limit vehicular access across the hillside terrace to abutting development. Access to the lot from other street frontages is

 preferable, consistent with standards for access to parking in the Land Use Code.

 2. Treatment of required active street-level use: Locate active street level uses in structures abutting the hillside terrace to activate the space and provide visual interest. Frontage equivalent to about half of the length of the hillside terrace, measured along the street property line, should be occupied by qualifying uses that are directly accessible from the terrace.

 3. Landscaping and furnishings: Use landscaping and furnishings, including required art, to integrate the terrace area with the sidewalk and abutting structures, as well as provide for the comfort and visual enjoyment of pedestrians.

 a. The arrangement of seating and landscaping should enhance the quality of the space and allow a variety of passive recreational activities without obstructing pedestrian movement.

 b. Approximately one lineal foot of seating should be provided for every 30 square feet of bonusable area.

 4. Coverage: To remain open to the street environment and maximize opportunities for views, hillside terraces should be open to the sky. However, limited coverage may be permitted to increase comfort, encourage activity, and better integrate the space with abutting development, provided that the space maintains its overall character as an extension of the sidewalk.

 Permitted coverage may occur as permanent, free-standing elements, such as retail kiosks or pedestrian shelters, or as an overhead arcade or other form of permanent or temporary overhead weather protection associated with abutting development.

 I. Urban Plaza

 Urban plazas are relatively large, strategically located open spaces that denote important downtown places, create a public focus for surrounding development, increase access to light and air at street level, and provide points of orientation within downtown. As key elements of the streetscape, urban plazas are especially beneficial when sited to complement the transit network by physically denoting major transit facilities, facilitating access to station entrances for large volumes of pedestrians, and providing amenities that contribute to the comfort and convenience of transit riders.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Minimum size: To ensure that the urban plaza is large enough to function as intended, and that the overall streetscape remains well- defined, the minimum size of a plaza shall be 6,000 square feet.

 2. Wind and solar access: If required by the Director, the design shall include special measures to reduce downdraft wind impacts from abutting development and to increase solar access to the plaza.

 3. Transit access: To accommodate transit station access and to account for the different relationship required between the street level and the level of the plaza, the Director may allow departure from these standards to ensure that access to the transit station is well integrated with the open space, and that the open space functions as intended.

 4. Exceptions: An urban plaza is not eligible for a bonus on any block containing an existing plaza bonused under Title 24 that exceeds 6,000 square feet, or an existing urban plaza bonused under Title 23, unless the Director determines that:

 a. the existing and proposed spaces can be integrated to create the appearance of a larger, unified space, provide a more prominent public focus, and increase public use by providing more activity, usable space and better pedestrian connections;

 b. the intensity of surrounding activity and volume of pedestrian traffic will ensure active use of the space; and

 c. the interruptions to the street edge created by relatively large open spaces will not detract from street activity or substantially erode the streetscape.

 Guidelines

 1. Street orientation and relationship to surrounding development: To denote their locations as transit access points and gateways, urban plazas should provide highly visible openings in the street facade, in contrast to the more enclosed character of adjacent streets with uninterrupted facades. However, the plaza space itself should be well defined by abutting structures, and interruptions to street level activity and the physical continuity of the streetscape should be minimized.

 a. The opening of a plaza onto a Class 1 Pedestrian Street should not exceed 120 feet.

 b. To minimize breaks in activity along streets requiring street level uses, the maximum plaza frontage open to the street should generally not exceed 80 feet, with structures containing street level uses separating other areas of the plaza from the sidewalk.

 c. Plazas at corner locations should be open and accessible from both streets, with the corner area clear of permanent structures.

 d. Siting and design of the plaza in relation to the rest of the project and surrounding development should maximize direct and/or reflected solar access. Preferable plaza locations are to the south of tower development, or where the siting of the plaza would improve solar access to the sidewalk.

 2. Area and dimensions: Urban plazas should be large enough to provide a prominent open space focus and accommodate a high level of pedestrian activity. Some areas within the plaza should be of sufficient size and designed to allow heavy volumes of pedestrian movement through the space, while other areas should accommodate more passive use.

 a. Provide a principal space that is a relatively large and open area to serve as the focus of the plaza. The principal space should be open to the sky, with a minimum area of about 4,000 square feet or 60 percent of the total plaza area, whichever is greater, and a minimum horizontal dimension of approximately 40 feet.

 b. The principal space should be directly accessible from the sidewalk and located no further from the sidewalk than the clear, unobstructed width of access along the street. This space should be generally at one level.

 c. The elevation of the plaza floor should generally be level, but may vary, provided that grade changes are gradual and do not significantly disrupt the continuity of the space. Greater grade changes may be allowed, as necessary, to provide access to transit tunnel stations.

 d. Variations to these conditions may be appropriate to improve access to transit stations or to respond to other special conditions of a particular lot.

 3. Access: The urban plaza should function as an extension of the public sidewalk, with minimal obstruction between the plaza and the sidewalk. On steeply sloping lots, the plaza should be designed to assist pedestrian movement up and down the hillside.

 4. Treatment of required active street-level uses: The urban plaza should promote a high level of activity complementing that of the abutting street. Frontage equivalent to at least fifty percent of the perimeter of the plaza should be occupied by uses qualifying as required active street level uses and having direct access onto the plaza.

 5. Landscaping and furnishings: Incorporate landscaping and special elements, including required public art, into the design of the plaza

 to create an aesthetically pleasing space that is well integrated with the surrounding street environment.

 a. Features of the plaza should establish an identity for the space and provide for the comfort of those using it, while also maintaining the desired sense of openness and easy street access. Features, including trees and artwork, should be of a scale appropriate for the size and prominence of these spaces.

 b. Landscaping and other furnishings should be arranged to enhance the quality of the space and allow a variety of passive recreational activities. A significant portion of the plaza area should be landscaped to soften the paved surfaces and other "hardscape" characteristics of these active, urban spaces.

 c. To ensure year round vegetation and color, seasonal plantings should be included.

 d. Approximately one lineal foot of seating should be provided for every 30 square feet of bonusable area.

 6. Coverage: To maximize access to light and air and the sense of openness within the public street environment, plazas should be predominantly open to the sky. However, limited coverage may be appropriate to increase activity in the space and provide for the comfort of users, while maintaining the overall character of the space as an extension of the outdoor public street environment.

 J. Transit Station Access: Mechanical Assists

 Lots including features that improve public access to stations serving major transit facilities may be eligible for a floor area bonus. To accommodate a variety of access conditions related to differences in the type, operation, and location of these facilities, the following station access improvements may be provided: 1) mechanical assists, 2) grade level access to transit stations, and 3) access easements.

 Mechanical assists facilitate pedestrian access to transit stations located above or below grade by providing direct access from the street level.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Eligible locations: Mechanically assisted transit station access shall be eligible for a bonus at locations approved by the transit provider and the Director.

 2. Size: The size of the access shall be determined by the transit provider. The access may be located partially in the street right-of- way.

 3. Evaluation criteria: The Director shall use the following locational criteria to evaluate the eligibility of a lot for the station access bonus:

 a. Lots from which the mechanical access to the transit station is provided shall abut a station mezzanine or be located within a 300- foot radius of the station mezzanine.

 b. The maximum distance from the public sidewalk adjacent to the transit station access to the station mezzanine is 400 feet. This shall be measured along the shortest path of travel from the sidewalk to the mezzanine, Figure A.

 c. The minimum distance from a bonused access to the nearest existing or proposed station entrance on the same block, measured along the street property line, is 180 feet, unless the Director and transit provider determine that additional access is warranted.

 d. The Director may approve a proposed access that uses a public right-of-way to reach a station mezzanine only when the Director determines that the connection will not adversely affect other uses of the right-of-way, including utilities.

[Figure A](/~ordpics/115524a3_4.gif)

 e. Queuing and circulation space off the existing sidewalk, in the form of a widened sidewalk, arcade, or public open space, shall be provided at both ends of the assist and shall have minimum dimensions as required by the Director after consultation with the transit provider.

 f. To increase visibility and comfort and convenience for transit

 riders, the mechanical assist may, upon approval by the Director, be incorporated as part of a bonused hillside terrace, urban plaza, public atrium, or shopping corridor.

 4. Visibility and accessibility: Mechanical assists shall be visible and directly accessible from the street. The assist entrance shall be immediately adjacent and accessible to a public sidewalk or public open space without any obstruction.

 5. Access times: The assist shall provide free access to the public at all times when the station is open.

 6. Vertical circulation elements: The vertical circulation elements of the access shall include stairways, escalators, and/or elevators, as determined by the transit provider. These elements shall meet the transit provider's standards for the following: escalator widths, stair rise and tread relationships, handrails, passageways, ramps, lighting, finishes and materials, ventilation, and information signage.

 7. Disabled access: Convenient access for the physically disabled shall be provided from the street level to the station, as determined by the transit provider.

 8. Special conditions

 a. The applicant shall submit a plan and commitment, acceptable to the Director after consultation with the transit provider, binding the applicant to construct the access in accordance with the plan, prior to issuance of any building permit that is required to build the access.

 b. The property owner shall grant in favor of the transit provider, and the transit provider shall accept a permanent easement for public use of the assist in connection with transit operations. The easement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 Guidelines

 1. Area and dimensions: Access ways should provide sufficient space to comfortably move large volumes of pedestrians between the transit station and the street without conflicting with sidewalk activity.

 a. Where access is not directly from the public sidewalk, the transit provider should determine the minimum width of the circulation path from the sidewalk to stairs and escalators to ensure adequate space to accommodate anticipated pedestrian volumes.

 b. All below-grade passages of the assist and all covered areas at or above grade should have a minimum height from finished floor to finished ceiling, including all lighting fixtures and signs, as required by the transit operator.

 2. Access

 a. The assist should connect, either directly or via an underground or above grade passageway, the sidewalk level with the transit station. When directly connected to the station mezzanine, portions of the station access above or below grade may be constructed within the street right-of-way.

 b. The assist entrance may be within a building, provided that hours of access are the same as the operating hours of the transit system.

 3. Landscaping and furnishing: Design of the station access should incorporate features that establish an identity for the facility and help orient transit riders. Features that add interest to the space without conflicting with pedestrian movement are encouraged, as well as measures to increase access to natural light and reduce noise.

 a. Non-transparent walls should be architecturally finished in an interesting way. Advertising shall be permitted in conformance with the transit provider's standards for size, area and location.

 b. Temporary kiosks, retail uses such as bookstalls, flower stands and newsstands, displays and exhibits are permitted provided they do not obstruct pedestrian movement and width of the main circulation path is no less than required by the transit provider.

 4. Lighting: Increasing access to natural light should be encouraged as much as possible through the siting of openings at street level and the use of transparent coverings.

 K. Transit Tunnel Station Access: Grade Level

 Lots including features that improve public access to stations serving major transit facilities may be eligible for a floor area bonus. To accommodate a variety of access conditions related to differences in the type, operation, and location of these facilities, the following station access improvements may be provided: 1) mechanical assists, 2) grade level access to transit stations, and 3) access easements.

 Topographic conditions along the transit tunnel alignment present opportunities for admitting natural light and providing pedestrian access to transit stations at approximately the same level as station mezzanines. The intent of grade level transit station access is to improve the accessibility and the quality of station environments by increasing daylight access into stations and integrating station connections with public open spaces.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Integration with open space: Grade Level Transit Tunnel Station Access must be integrated with public open space. The location of the access is subject to the approval of the transit provider and the Director.

 2. Size: The size of the access must be approved by the transit provider. The access shall be on multiple levels, and may be located partially in the street right-of-way.

 3. Locational criteria: The Director shall use the following locational criteria to evaluate the eligibility of a lot for the station access bonus:

 a. Lots from which grade level access to transit stations is provided shall abut a station mezzanine or be located within a 300-foot radius of the station mezzanine.

 b. The maximum distance from the public sidewalk adjacent to the transit station access to the station mezzanine shall be 400 feet. This shall be measured along the shortest path of travel from the sidewalk to the mezzanine, Figure A.

[Figure A"](/~ordpics/115524a3_5.gif)

 c. The minimum distance from a bonused access to the nearest existing or proposed station entrance on the same block, measured along the street property line, shall be 180 feet.

 d. The Director may approve a proposed access using a public right- of-way to reach a station mezzanine only when the Director determines that the connection will not adversely affect other uses of the right-of-way including utilities.

 4. Access: A physically and visually direct path through the required open space integrated with the Transit Tunnel Station Access shall connect the street with the station access and shall meet the following conditions established by the transit provider and the Director:

 a. A clear path with a minimum width established by the Director after consultation with the transit provider shall be required between the transit station frontage and a public sidewalk. Stairs may be a part of the path, but the difference in grade between the station access frontage and the elevation of the street providing access to the station shall accommodated by ramps or gradual level changes in the floor of the open space.

 b. Signage indicating the location of the transit station shall be provided at the entrance to the open space on the street front.

 c. The public shall have unobstructed, well lighted access through the open space at all hours that the station mezzanine is open.

 5. Special conditions

 a. Approval of any building permit required to build the access shall depend upon approval of a plan submitted by the developer to the Director and the transit provider binding the developer to construct the access in accordance with the plan.

 b. An agreement shall be required between the property owner and the transit provider granting a permanent easement for public use of the access in connection with transit operations. The easement shall be recorded with the deed to the property at the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 Guidelines

 1. Access: Bonused public open space adapted to accommodate station access should provide a relatively level route between the street and the mezzanine or concourse of the transit station.

 a. Providing open space at the same elevation as a transit station mezzanine may require portions of the open space to be substantially below some street elevations. Departure from provisions regarding the elevation of a particular open space feature may be permitted. However, changes in grade between the sidewalk and abutting depressed portions of open space should not create the effect of a precipice along the sidewalk edge.

 b. The level of the open space should generally not be more than five feet below the street elevation along the sidewalk edge. Where the open space is more than five feet below the street elevation, it should be separated from the sidewalk by another use or a landscaped area directly accessible from the sidewalk and extending a minimum of ten feet from the sidewalk onto the lot.

 2. Landscaping and furnishing: Public amenity features providing access to transit stations should be designed to reinforce clear and direct connections from the street through the space to the station, while also serving their intended function as public open space. In both overall design and details, the treatment of station areas and public open space areas should be coordinated to produce a cohesive whole.

 a. Any bonused public open space area used to provide access to the transit station should conform to the applicable landscaping standards and guidelines for that particular amenity. However, at the discretion of the Director, modifications may be allowed to better adapt the space to specific conditions associated with its relationship to the transit station.

 b. Non-transparent walls should be architecturally finished in an interesting way. Advertising shall be permitted in conformance with standards of the transit provider for size, area, and location.

 c. Temporary kiosks, retail uses such as bookstalls, flower stands and newsstands, displays, and exhibits may be permitted provided they do not obstruct pedestrian movement and the width of the main circulation path is no less than required by the transit provider.

 3. Natural Lighting: To enhance conditions in the transit station, the open space feature should be sited and designed to increase as much as possible the amount of natural light reaching access areas and the mezzanine level.

 L. Transit Station Access: Access Easement

 Lots including features that improve public access to stations serving major transit facilities may be eligible for a floor area bonus. To accommodate a variety of access conditions related to differences in the type, operation, and location of these facilities, the following station access improvements may be provided: 1) mechanical assists, 2) grade level access to transit stations, and 3) access easements.

 Access easements increase opportunities for direct access to transit stations from the street level. The easement defines a volume of space adjacent to a transit station on a lot, either inside or outside of a structure, or both, in which the transit provider would construct a station entrance. An easement may be combined with bonused hillside terraces, urban plazas, shopping atriums, and shopping corridors to integrate public open space amenities with access to transit stations.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Location and size approval: The size of the access, and location, and suitability of the easement shall be subject to approval by transit provider.

 2. Incorporation with other amenities: To increase visibility and comfort and convenience for transit riders, the access easement may, upon approval by the Director, be incorporated as part of bonused hillside terraces, urban plazas, public atriums and shopping corridors.

 3. Area and dimensions: The configuration and all vertical and horizontal dimensions of the easement shall allow for construction and maintenance of the station access and include sufficient space to

 accommodate both mechanical and a non-mechanical means of travel to the station.

 4. Locational criteria: The Director shall use the following criteria to evaluate the eligibility of a lot for the station access bonus:

 a. Lots on which the easement for access to the transit station is provided shall abut a station mezzanine or be located within a 300 foot radius of the station mezzanine.

 b. The maximum distance from the public sidewalk adjacent to the transit station access easement to the station mezzanine shall be 400 feet. This shall be measured along the shortest path of travel from the sidewalk to the mezzanine, Figure A.

[Figure A"](/~ordpics/115524a3_6.gif)

 c. The minimum distance from the proposed access point in the easement area to the nearest existing or proposed station entrance on the same block, measured along the street property line, shall be 180 feet.

 d. The Director may approve a proposed access easement which uses a public right-of-way to reach a station mezzanine only when it has been determined that the connection will not adversely affect other uses of the right-of-way including utilities.

 e. The location of the easement shall be approved by the transit provider before a bonus may be granted.

 5. Construction of station access: The design and construction of the station access within the easement area shall be the responsibility of the transit provider. The property owner shall deliver to the Director, prior to a signed commitment from the transit provider, acceptable to the Director, for the construction of the station access. The property owner shall cooperate as necessary during construction to facilitate installation of the station access, including but not limited to the potential temporary closure of some areas of the site or structure adjacent to the defined easement.

 6. Access and hours of operation

 a. The area and location of the easement shall be configured to allow direct access from the sidewalk or public open space to the station.

 b. All portions of the easement area that are part of the path of travel for access to the transit station shall be open to the public for the purpose of access to and from the transit station at all times when the station is open.

 7. Maintenance of landscaping and furnishings

 a. When landscaping, furnishings or other amenities are provided within an easement area, the owner is responsible for maintenance except when the area is under the exclusive regulation of the transit provider.

 b. The owner shall maintain all landscaping, furnishings or other elements in the easement area that are also a part of another bonused feature, in accordance with the requirements of the particular public benefit feature.

 8. Special Conditions: The property owner and the transit provider shall execute an agreement specifying the area and all dimensions of the easement. The property owner shall grant in favor of the transit provider, and the transit provider shall accept, a permanent easement for public use of the station access in connection with transit operations. The easement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 M. Human Services

 The human services bonus is intended to provide space for human service uses at locations easily accessible to target populations.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Location. Space for human service uses shall be bonused in all downtown areas where public benefit features are permitted. Alternatively, at the discretion of the Director, a bonus may be granted for a voluntary agreement to contribute funds to the City for a downtown health and human services endowment fund, which shall support such facilities at appropriate locations throughout downtown.

 2. Street orientation. The location of a human service must be evident from the street, either as a result of frontage at street level or through exterior and interior signage clearly visible from the street.

 3. Area and dimensions. The minimum area shall be 1,000 square feet or interior space.

 4. Special conditions: The applicant shall secure at least a five year lease with a qualified human service agency.

 a. Any additional improvements beyond the minimum requirements needed for specific service activities may be provided either by the applicant or the agency.

 b. Rent shall not be charged for use of the space.

 c. On an interim basis (not to exceed six months from any time the space is vacated by a qualifying human service use), if the space remains unoccupied, it may be used for non-profit purposes as a community/public area, under the following conditions:

 i. The space shall be made available to community and charitable organizations (not to be used for profit-making activities ).

 ii. The space shall be made available for both day and evening use.

 iii. The space shall be made available on a first come, first serve basis to community/charitable organizations.

 iv. There shall be no charge for use of the space, except for any costs that may be necessary by the interim use.

 v. The space shall be accessible to the elderly and disabled.

 vi. Availability of the space and the contact persons shall be made known to community/charitable groups through means such as newspaper articles, radio announcements, flyers to organizations, and contacts with umbrella organizations such as the Downtown Human Services Council and the Central Seattle Community Council Federation.

 5. Access: The human services space must either have direct access to the street or be accessible along a well marked route that leads from a building entrance located on a street and does not require the use of steps.

 6. Finishings: The applicant shall finish the space with ceilings, walls, floors, and utility connections.

 N. Restoration and Preservation of Landmark Performing Arts Theatre

 The landmark performing arts theater (LPAT) bonus is intended to contribute to the city's architectural, historic and cultural heritage by encouraging the preservation, rehabilitation and use of landmark performing arts theaters as defined by the City in SMC Chapter 23.84.

 Eligibility Conditions

 1. Application Process: Proposals that include a LPAT bonus require a Certificate of Approval from the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board for any modifications to the LPAT in accordance with the requirements of Part 6 of the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Ordinance (Seattle Municipal Code, Sections 25.12.670-.790), unless the plan of rehabilitation is incorporated in the controls and incentives approved by City Council pursuant to SMC 25.12.510. If the owner of a LPAT is also applying to transfer development rights, or for public subsidies, subsidy review will be performed by the Office of Housing (OH). Use of this bonus is subject to completion of subsidy review by OH. Application for the LPAT bonus is made at the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) using application forms provided by DPD in conjunction with OH. The forms will describe the financial and other documentation required for the OH

 subsidy review.

 2. Security: If a LPAT bonus is sought, the applicant for a permit for the project proposing to use the bonus will be required to provide security for the completion of the rehabilitation of the landmark theater. Security may be provided in the form of cash in a restricted escrow account, letter of credit or other form acceptable to the City. Security shall be posted when the final building permit is issued for the project using the bonus FAR. A waiver from the security requirement may be permitted for an on-site LPAT at time of issuance of building permit. The Landmarks Preservation Board may modify this requirement to allow for a phased rehabilitation program and/or a phased occupancy for the landmark theater. Funds may be drawn from the security by the owner of the theater during the course of the rehabilitation work with prior approval of the OH Director.

 3. Duration: The theater is required to be available for the duration of any commitment made to qualify for a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) bonus for at least 180 days a year for live theater performances. An annual report by the theater owner to DPD shall specify the number of days when live performances took place, number of days not open, and number of days when other types of entertainment were provided.

 The use of the theater primarily as a performing arts theater for at least 40 years* shall be ensured by binding covenants between the theater owner and the City. The recipient of the bonus (unless also the theater owner) shall have no obligation for the operation of the theater.

 *and for so long thereafter as any of the interior features of the theater portion of the structure remains subject to controls under the Landmarks Ordinance or successor provisions, unless after the minimum 40 year period the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Landmarks Board that a change in use is required to allow the owner a sufficient economic return under the standards then applicable to proceedings for removal or modification of such controls.

 4. Restrictive Covenant: A restrictive covenant approved by DPD in consultation with OH and DON shall be recorded by DPD with the King County Department of Records and Elections on the property on which the LPAT is located. If other bonuses or TDRs are used, the restrictive covenant may be combined with a Performance Agreement, as approved by OH. The covenant will include the terms, duration, priority of commitment, commitment to repair and maintain the structure and right to access by City staff.

 If the requirements of the covenant are not met, then in addition to other remedies, the City may apply to a court for appointment of a receiver to manage the theater.

 5. Variable Bonus Ratio: The Land Use Code permits a variable bonus ratio (maximum of 12). It is intended to be set at a ratio which makes the LPAT bonus competitive with other bonuses available for use by the project. Determination of the exact bonus ratio will depend upon the cost of rehabilitation, the cost per square foot of bonusable theater space of obtaining a linkage (market conditions), other subsidies available for the theater rehabilitation and a comparative analysis of costs per square foot of using other bonuses. DPD shall request documentation of sources and uses of funds for theater rehabilitation. DPD will review information, and consult with other departments and determine what bonus ratio is appropriate.

 III. Public Benefit Features Eligible for Floor Area Exemption Only

 O. Major Retail Store

 Major retail stores, including full service department stores, provide retail anchors that reinforce shopping activity in the Downtown retail core and increase the area's regional draw for customers. These facilities expand the range of goods and services available to Downtown shoppers and, as retail "magnets," support other uses necessary to the health and vitality of the area. One way to help offset the cost of accommodating the large amount of floor area a major retail store requires is to include them as part of the mix in a larger development with more revenue generating uses. Allowing a floor area exemption will enable major retail stores to be accommodated in mixed use developments, without reducing the amount of chargeable floor area allowed for other commercial uses.

 Eligibility Conditions for Floor Area Exemption

 1. Access: Direct access to the street is required, although exempt retail space may be provided above and below the street level as long as all areas are connected and function as a single retail establishment.

 2. Management structure: The store must function as a single retail establishment, under the management of a single retail operation.

 Guidelines

 1. Access: The store should be oriented to activity on the street and, wherever possible, provide opportunities for through block circulation. At least one major entrance should be provided directly from the sidewalk of each street frontage, with at least one principal entrance at the same elevation as the sidewalk. Multiple access points are desirable, as well as protected areas set back from the sidewalk at entrances to accommodate pedestrian flow and provide shelter.

 P. Museum

 Museums add to the mix of Downtown activity and provide educational, cultural and/or recreational opportunities by establishing permanent interior areas for viewing objects, programs or presentations of natural, scientific, historical, cultural or literary interest.

 Eligibility Conditions for Floor Area Exemption

 1. Eligibility criteria: Museum space eligible for a floor area exemption must meet the following criteria:

 a. The museum does not have a commercial character or is not used for commercial purposes, although associated uses, such as a museum shop

 or snack bar, may be permitted.

 b. The use of the space has significant, long term educational, cultural and/or recreational value and interest to the public.

 c. Information is available to enhance public enjoyment and knowledge of items on display. Presentations that encourage public participation or direct interaction with the display are desirable.

 d. Ample space is provided to ensure that displayed items can be viewed to best advantage. Renderings illustrating typical features of the display area shall be available for review by the Director.

 2. Use proposal: The developer must present a proposal for the use of the museum identifying the nature of items to be displayed or programs to be presented as well as examples of typical design and layout of exhibits in the space.

 3. Lease requirements: If the operator of the museum is not the same as the developer, a ten year lease from the operator of the museum identifying the use of the space shall be secured by the developer for review by the Director. The lease shall be secured within two years of the date that the first Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the project with the museum, or when the final Certificate of Occupancy is issued, whichever is first.

 Guidelines

 1. Area and Dimensions: Adequate space should be provided for exhibits and public viewing, as well as necessary storage and support facilities. All such support spaces may be exempted from calculations of chargeable floor area.

 2. Street orientation: The street level treatment of museums should provide pedestrian interest and attraction.

 a. To minimize disruption of street level activity, the museum's street frontage should be limited. Separating museum space from the street by other more active street level uses may be appropriate.

 b. Either transparent frontage sufficient to allow views into the exhibition area, or exterior signage and display cases visible from the street or a public open space shall be provided.

 3. Access

 a. Access to the museum should be apparent to pedestrians through signs or direct visibility from the street or public open space.

 b. The museum should be functionally separate from other areas of the project. While access to the major circulation areas of a building, such as elevator lobbies, is desirable, and may be provided, the display space should be independent of these circulation areas. If needed, walls or other enclosure should be provided.

 Q. Shopping Atrium

 Shopping atriums provide enclosed, weather protected public spaces in concentrated shopping areas to enhance shopping activity while maintaining active and visually interesting retail streets. The enclosed space of the atrium may be on multiple levels and must be of sufficient size to accommodate public gatherings and events where shoppers can rest, relax and enjoy surrounding activity.

 Eligibility Conditions for Floor Area Exemption

 1. Pedestrian access: A pedestrian entrance with direct access from the sidewalk shall be provided on each street frontage of the atrium.

 2. Uses: Active uses are required on the perimeter of atrium space, consistent with the applicable guidelines below.

 3. Required features: Landscaping and furnishings, including art, are required, consistent with the applicable guidelines below.

 4. Natural Lighting: To improve the quality of the space, support interior landscaping and increase the overall sense of openness, the principal space of the shopping atrium must have access to natural light, consistent with the applicable guidelines below.

 Guidelines

 1. Area and dimensions: Shopping atriums should be spacious to accommodate a high level of activity and multiple uses, including public gatherings. Interior spaces should be arranged to integrate the shopping atrium with both the exterior street environment and the internal circulation of the project.

 a. The shopping atrium should include a principal space of at least 2,400 square feet that provides the public focus and is proportionally the largest and most prominent feature of the atrium. Other areas may accommodate functions and activities that support the principal space and further integrate the atrium with the rest of the project and the street environment.

 b. The entire floor area of the principal space should generally be level with the average sidewalk grade at the main entrance to the shopping atrium. The principal space should be at one level, with minor adjustments of levels permitted, provided that the difference in elevation between the highest and lowest points is generally within four feet.

 c. The exempt floor area may be on multiple levels. All exempt floor area should be directly accessible by escalator, walkway, or stairs to the principal space. All exempt floor area should have visual access to the principal space.

 d. Exempt floor area should generally be clear and unobstructed by walls or other elements exceeding approximately three feet in height, except that escalators; artwork; and free standing retail kiosks may be permitted. The height and the total area covered by these elements should be limited to ensure the desired sense of spaciousness and unobstructed pedestrian circulation.

 2. Access and street orientation: The location of a shopping atrium should be highly apparent from the street and easily accessible and inviting to pedestrians. Wherever possible, the atrium and its connections to the street should be designed to improve overall pedestrian circulation on the block.

 a. The main entrance to the atrium should be at sidewalk grade.

 b. For lots with frontage on two Avenues, the atrium should provide a clear direct connection between the Avenues.

 c. Because shopping atriums are located in active shopping areas, the street frontage of the atrium space should be limited to avoid disrupting the continuity of retail activity along the street. The maximum street frontage of the shopping atrium space, including entrances, but not including retail uses with access to the street, should be approximately sixty feet on any one street.

 d. The principal space of the atrium should be visible from adjacent sidewalks. Visual and physical access to the space should be provided along as much of the atrium's street frontage as possible.

 3. Required active uses: Shopping atriums should intensify retail activity within shopping areas by increasing available retail frontage on streets and public areas.

 a. Frontage generally equivalent to at least seventy-five percent of the perimeter of each level of the entire exempt area of the atrium space should be occupied by uses meeting the definition of active street level uses. All of these uses should have direct access to the atrium.

 b. Any street level uses on the perimeter of the shopping atrium with frontage on a street should also be accessible from the street.

 4. Landscaping and furnishings: Landscaping and furnishings of the shopping atrium, including required art, should create an attractive and comfortable atmosphere for shoppers. Features should add interest and activity while allowing flexible use of the space, especially for public gatherings and events. Landscaping and other design treatments should reinforce the prominence of the principal space, while ensuring a cohesive relationship between the principal space and abutting accessory space.

 5. Natural lighting: The Director shall use the following guidelines for required skylights and/or clerestory windows to ensure sufficient natural light:

 a. Skylights that, at a minimum, provide access to natural light for approximately twenty-five percent of the roof area above the principal space; or

 b. Windows or clerestory windows at a height of approximately eight feet or more that, at a minimum, allow access to natural light through approximately twenty-five percent of the perimeter of the principal space; or

 c. Some combination of a. and b. above, or similar features admitting ample light.

 NOTE TO FILE

 FOR

 SEPA ANALYSIS OF DOWNTOWN HEIGHT & DENSITY CHANGES

 March 2006

 The SEPA environmental review process for proposals to change height and density in specific Downtown zones began in May 2001 with a Determination of Significance, proceeding to a Draft EIS published in November 2003 and a Final EIS published in January 2005. After an appeal of the EIS was heard by the City's Hearing Examiner and her

 findings recorded (dismissing the appeal), staff from the City's Department of Planning and Development completed work on a draft ordinance for zoning and Land Use Code changes, and submitted it to City Council.

 In the course of its review, the Chair of the City Council's Urban Development and Planning Committee proposed several alternative changes to zoning and Land Use Code details. These are collectively referred to in this document as "CM Steinbrueck Recommendations" to distinguish them from the Mayor's Preferred Alternative, which was described in the Final EIS.

 This "note to file" discusses the potential for environmental impacts related to CM Steinbrueck's Recommendations, as well as a few detailed aspects of the Mayor's Preferred Alternative that either were not known at the time of Final EIS publication, or were not discussed in detail in the programmatic-level EIS. These comments are not meant to suggest that the aforementioned environmental review was incomplete, but to provide more perspective on the relationship of the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations to the prior environmental review.

 The elements of the environment included in the Downtown Height and Density EIS include:

 --Population and Employment --Climate: Shadows and Wind

 --Housing --Transportation

 --Land Use --Parking

 --Relationship to Plans and Policies --Energy

 --Urban Design: Height, Bulk and Scale --Water Utility

 --Urban Design: Pedestrian Amenities & Open --Sewer and Stormwater Utilities Space

 --Views and Aesthetics ..TX: This "note-to-file" comments upon the extent to which the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations and various details addressed by Land Use Code changes might generate differences in already-published environmental review findings.

 Description of CM Steinbrueck's Recommendations

 These recommendations consist of alternative zoning proposals that would:

 * alter the office core zones by increasing the density and eliminating the height limit in the Downtown Office Core 1 zone, and lowering the height limit in the Downtown Office Core 2 zone by 100' compared to the Executive Proposal;

 * provide for lesser heights in one portion of DMC on the western edge of 1st Avenue; and

 * provide additional tower spacing requirements in DMC zones between the DRC and the Pike Market Mixed zones.

 The table below and attached graphics describe the councilmember's recommendations in more detail, compared to existing zoning and the Executive Proposal.

 In addition, the CM Steinbrueck recommendations propose variations from the Executive Proposal in detailed aspects of bulk control, accessory uses, and fee-related topics including:

 * changes to the tower spacing requirements, including increasing the spacing for towers within block in an area zoned DMC 240'/240'-400' between the retail core and Pike Place Market, and excluding DOC2 from spacing requirements for residential towers;

 * maximum tower width;

 * upper level facade length limits ("modulation");

 * upper level setbacks;

 * transparency requirements;

 * coverage allowance for rooftop features;

 * permissible locations for accessory parking; and

 * amount of new fee charged to residential development to offset related impacts.

 Other Topics of Comment

 Parking: The Chapter 4 Summary of Impacts in the Final EIS included mention of the concept of no minimum parking requirement for commercial use, in relation to the Preferred Alternative (a.k.a. Executive Proposal). However, this aspect of proposed changes was not discussed in detail. This "note-to-file" describes general impact implications of this proposed regulatory change.

 COMMENTARY ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IMPLICATIONS

 Several of the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations would result in lower heights, reduced appearance of bulk, and a variety of differences that could be interpreted as having fewer adverse impacts compared to the Executive Proposal. This analysis identifies some but not all of the positive impact implications, but is oriented toward identifying adverse impacts.

 For some of the elements of the environment, the changes under review would have little or no substantive impact implications, including: Population and Employment, Shadows and Wind, Transportation, Parking, Energy, Water Utility, Sewer and Stormwater Utilities. These topics are not further addressed unless relevant.

 ZONE CHANGES

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations would reduce the height (by 100

 feet) allowed within the DOC 2 zoned portion of the Denny Triangle and Commercial Core near the existing retail core, compared to the Executive Proposal. However, the height and density permitted in the DOC 1 zone (the heart of the office core) would increase by 3 FAR compared to the Executive Proposal, and the height limit in the DOC 1 zone would be eliminated.

 In addition, the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations would propose a downzone of three half blocks along the west side of 1st Avenue between Columbia and Spring Streets. This strip would change from an existing zone of DMC with a 240-foot height limit to DMC with a 160- foot height limit. It was defined as a DMC 240'/400' zone in the Executive Proposal.

 Housing

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations proposes a three block increase in the amount of DMC 240'/400' zoned land in the Denny Triangle neighborhood that could result in a greater number and concentration of future mixed-use developments dominated by residential uses. This could help reinforce a residential character in these areas rather than an office-dominated character. This might aid in establishing a more activated, round-the-clock and safer environment that is better for residential living than an office-dominated area that could be mostly deserted during non-work hours. In the DOC 1 zone, the changes could result in increased assurance that property would continue to be dominated by commercial uses. Alternatively, however, the ability to insert housing into commercial buildings without affecting maximum FAR calculations and without a particular confining height limit might lead to an infusion of new housing that presumably would serve higher-income households. The potential for significant adverse housing impacts from these changes would be minimal.

 Land Use/Plans and Policies

 The proposed additional tower spacing in the Pike Place Market vicinity would aid in controlling the bulk and scale of future development, and might further tip the scale toward residential- oriented development rather than commercial development. This could assist in the revitalization and overall improvement of this vicinity over time. No adverse impacts are identified for the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations with respect to plans and policies.

 Height/Bulk/Scale

 In addition to the positive and negative implications mentioned

 above, the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations would reduce the maximum height of development in the DOC2 area by 100' in the Denny Triangle, providing a more gradual transition from higher- to lower-height areas. These are interpreted as mostly positive outcomes, although the Final EIS aesthetic analyses suggested a more diverse and interesting skyline would result with taller buildings in the Denny Triangle under the Executive Proposal. In addition, the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations for lower zoning along a part of Western Avenue would somewhat reduce the potential for height, bulk and scale impacts on nearby properties in this area near the Waterfront and Pioneer Square (even when comparing to the existing condition).

 Pedestrian Amenities and Open Space

 A brief review suggests that the slightly increased residential potential in Denny Triangle, as well as additional measures addressing overhead weather protection, safety lighting, and bulk and scale, might assist in creating a more pleasant pedestrian environment at street level (a positive impact). Maintaining some form of the City/County transfer of development program in DOC1, proposed to be eliminated by the Executive Proposal in the Denny Triangle, could help contribute to the preservation of rural County land.

 Views and Aesthetics

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations for 3 more blocks of DMC 240'/400' zoning instead of taller DMC 340'/400' zoning, and the proposed reduction of DOC 2 height limits from 600 feet to 500 feet, would tend to reduce the overall potential for view/aesthetic impacts. For example, views of the Denny Triangle from the north and from the east would include newly-developed buildings somewhat smaller scaled, and/or further from most viewers such that there would be less potential for perceived view impacts. However, even with the alternative proposal, there would still remain some potential for perception of view and aesthetic impacts with future development, in ways similar to the Executive Proposal.

 BULK AND USE CHANGES

 Housing

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations' differences from the Executive Proposal are comparatively minor with minimal potential for additional adverse impacts on housing.

 In the DOC 1 zone, the ability to construct housing without affecting maximum density calculations and the proposed abolition of a maximum height limit could result in novel designs in future development that would pair office and residential uses, potentially reaching high heights that are not currently possible or anticipated. This would provide an additional option for achieving residential uses in Downtown, which is interpreted as a positive housing impact. However, through use of mechanisms like the Planned Community Development (PCD) process, commercial densities calculated on several

 blocks could be transferred to a single lot and, without the constriction of a height limit, result in taller commercial structures than otherwise anticipated.

 Land Use/Plans and Policies

 Nearly all of the recommended changes in bulk and land use would have no significant impact implications on Downtown land use because the amount of difference from the Executive Proposal is relatively minor (see the Height, Bulk and Scale discussion below).

 The recommended changes in DOC 1 to abolish the height limit and increase density limits by 3 FAR compared to the Executive Proposal would represent a bit of a departure from zoning practices in the more recent past. The absence of a height limit is not anticipated by plans, policies or current zoning. Therefore, while various policies promote flexibility in future development, appropriate scales of development, and compatible uses, they do not suppose an "unlimited" condition can exist. If not properly regulated, such a condition would probably be inconsistent with the policy guidance expressed in plans and zoning codes to date (even though it would be consistent with the preferred pattern of the densest, tallest uses in the DOC 1 zoned area).

 If it is assumed that the recommended changes will have safeguards that prevent unlimited stacking of uses with no height limit, and that typical design practices and economic demand would place practical limits on the maximum height that can be achieved, the recommended changes would not in reality constitute an "unlimited" condition. However, this does not appear to be the case with the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations.

 If there are no safeguards against unlimited stacking, accumulation of permissible density from many properties into one property, or arrangement of uses within an unlimited vertical building envelope, the result conceivably could be the construction of buildings in novel arrangements and/or significantly taller than previously anticipated. For example, a "needle-like" tower as seen in Toronto and other cities might possibly extend beyond what is anticipated in typical highrise buildings, because middle portions of the building would have little or no floor area. Additional inclusion of residential uses on top of existing buildings, increased potential for demolition of highrises to be replaced by larger towers, and addition of narrow but tall towers to existing built blocks all would appear to be possible outcomes. In a broader sense, this sort of flexibility may be interpreted as a positive outcome that could bring additional energy and diversity to Seattle's Downtown. It also could be interpreted as creating more pressure for redevelopment on some properties that previously were considered fully built out, perhaps an outcome with adverse impact implications for overall land use character.

 One probable safeguard is that the Director of DPD will continue to hold authority to approve development proposals, and could exercise power if justified to deny an application. Another probable safeguard against inordinate height is the limit placed on the skyline by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airspace requirements for aircraft approaching Boeing Field. The axis of the airspace measurement "surface" extends north-northwest over Elliott Bay relatively near to the Waterfront, with other "surfaces" that rise gradually in the perpendicular direction. Given the topography of Downtown, it is somewhat complex to interpret the exact height implications, but buildings extending above the height of the Columbia Center (or even somewhat lower heights in some locations) would potentially violate the FAA airspace requirements.

 Height/Bulk/Scale

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations include several modest changes in the building bulk and scale standards, compared to the Executive Proposal. The recommendations would alter various regulatory details that affect bulk and scale by 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet, generally in ways that would tend to reduce the overall bulk or appearance of bulk. Changes of this type and magnitude would have minimal differences in overall impacts compared to the Executive Proposal and may be indistinguishable by Downtown users. Most of the differences in potential impacts would be positive, with only a couple of changes resulting in any potential for additional adverse impacts on height, bulk and scale.

 The most important of these changes with adverse impact potential would increase the density limit of the DOC 1 zone from 17 (Executive Proposal) to 20 FAR, with no maximum height limit established in that zone (compared to a 700-foot height limit in DOC 1 under the Executive Proposal). The height/bulk/scale implications are covered by the discussion above for Land Use.

 A related implication of the Councilmember Recommendations is that more future buildings will be built in a taller and slimmer profile within the DOC 1 zone, if a developer wishes to build taller buildings for prestige, view amenity, or architectural prominence. This could add diversity to the Seattle skyline.

 Views and Aesthetics

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations include several modest changes in the building bulk standards, compared to the Executive Proposal. The net effect on overall aesthetics of Downtown development (except in the DOC 1 zone) would be slightly different shaping of future buildings with slightly less bulk potential at lower levels, and potentially less parking provided above street level in residential structures. This should have a slight positive impact on overall aesthetics of future development and street-level environment. In zones other than DOC 1, the net effect on potential view impacts would be virtually indistinguishable by viewers of the skyline from any direction. No additional adverse view or aesthetic impacts are identified. However, in the DOC 1 zone, the lack of height limit and other factors might combine to result in strikingly different and/or taller buildings that would add to the diversity of the skyline. This could be interpreted as positive by some viewers and negative by other viewers.

 Shadows

 None of the proposed changes addresses reducing the shadow impacts on the specific public spaces that are covered by SEPA review. Given the complexities in modeling shadow impacts, it cannot be reasonably determined whether the CM Steinbrueck Recommendations would result in fewer shadow impacts on public spaces than the Executive Proposal. However, most of the Councilmember Recommendations would slightly reduce the potential for building bulk and scale, such that possible

 shadowing of Downtown streets would be slightly less than under the Executive Proposal. The additional spacing of towers in the DMC area

 between the Pike Place Market and retail core should help reduce the potential for shadows in the public areas of these high volume pedestrian environments.

 Parking Impacts

 The recommended changes associated with location of parking above and/or below grade would influence design possibilities, but would not be likely to generate significant adverse parking impacts. Inclusion of parking would still be possible in future development.

 FEE CHANGES

 Housing

 Fee-related changes would appear to require a higher financial contribution by residential developers to meet regulatory requirements. This would to some degree influence overall development feasibility, and some could cite this type of change as discouraging future housing development. This might be construed as an impact, but this sort of financial feasibility impact lies outside the scope of SEPA review. The proposed fees are within the bounds of possible fees supported by nexus analyses that identify actual levels of impacts in terms of financial costs. Also, it appears doubtful that the higher proposed fees would single-handedly prevent development feasibility. Therefore, even if this topic is within the purview of SEPA, no significant adverse impact is identified.

 The CM Steinbrueck Recommendations would provide a bonus for buildings that meet the LEED Silver standards, as opposed to the Executive proposal, which used the lower LEED certification standard.

 LEED Silver should provide increased energy efficiency and more sustainable development over time.

 Land Use/Plans and Policies

 If there is any detectible land use impact from the proposed fee- related changes, it conceivably could result in higher development costs that would cause a greater proportion of future housing in the area to be "higher-end" or "above-median" housing. This may be balanced by the affordable housing expected to be produced through use of the bonus fees. However, as noted above, matters of financial feasibility lie outside the scope of SEPA review, so it is questionable whether such an impact should be identified in this SEPA review.

 PARKING

 As noted earlier in this document, the Final EIS disclosed the possibility of no minimum parking requirement for commercial use, in relation to the Executive Proposal. However, the Draft EIS analysis of parking impacts did not explicitly mention this possibility. Additional discussion is provided in this document to characterize the general implications of this elimination of parking requirement.

 Parking and Land Use/Plans and Policies

 The proposed elimination of parking requirements could have additional implications with regard to parking supplies Downtown. This could result in additional reductions in the projected amounts of parking supply provided with future development than previously reported in the Draft EIS parking analysis. Another previously undisclosed possibility is that existing buildings could submit applications for approval to remove existing parking that was a condition of their original Master Use Permit. Presumably, the space in parking would be put to other uses. This could also result in further reductions of Downtown parking supply than previously reported.

 This additional information does not create any further significant adverse impact implications because City plans and policies advocate for limiting parking in Downtown, to help promote greater use of transit and other transportation modes. Therefore, the proposal could be interpreted as having positive impact implications. Depending upon how the market would respond in providing parking where none is required, additional growth in Downtown with less proportional provision of new parking would tend to increase the cost for daily parking. There would likely also be further increases in competition for various types of on-street and off-street parking in affected Downtown areas and the surrounding vicinity.
