 AN ORDINANCE relating to wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.28.080 to adjust the calculation of summer residential wastewater charges for customers with inadequate consumption records.

 WHEREAS, metered winter water consumption is the basis for residential wastewater charges in both the winter and the summer because most of the water consumed during the winter is discharged into the wastewater system and the quantity of such discharges is similar in winter and summer; and

 WHEREAS, when winter water consumption records are unavailable or inaccurate, residential customers may be billed for summer wastewater use at the typical monthly winter water consumption level of residential households; and

 WHEREAS, residential water use has declined due to changes in customer habits and conservation programs; and

 WHEREAS, the level of typical monthly winter wastewater consumption used in billing residential customers for whom winter water consumption records are unavailable or inaccurate should be revised to reflect lower typical residential wastewater use; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2005, Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.28.080.B is amended as follows:

 B. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may use an assumed volume of five and two tenths (5.2)~~six (6)~~ CCF per household, or prior water consumption records if those records are more representative of expected usage, to calculate residential wastewater charges under the following circumstances:

 1. When the water meter has been determined to be malfunctioning;

 2. When customers have insufficient water consumption history to calculate average winter water consumption;

 3. When water use in the period used to calculate average winter water consumption is not representative of expected water use, such as rental property that is vacant between tenants or in the case of seasonal customers; and

 4. When customers are not served by a publicly owned water supply system.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
