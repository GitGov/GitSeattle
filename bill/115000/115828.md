 Coordinated Bargaining

 Memorandum of Understanding

 Between the City of Seattle

 And

 Signatory Unions

 November 1, 2006

 This Agreement is by and between the City of Seattle (the City) and the signatory Unions (the Unions).

 Whereas, the City and the Unions entered into negotiations due to a re-opener on Personal Holidays contained in the Tentative Agreement between the City of Seattle and the Coalition of City Unions signed on May 25, 2005;

 Whereas, the City and the Unions agreed to increase the number of personal holidays granted to employees with ten years of City service from two per year to four per year; and

 Whereas, the City and the Unions agreed that employees working 4/10 schedules will be paid eight hours for each City holiday; therefore,

 The City and the Unions agree as follows:

 I. Definition:

 "Covered Employee" means a City employee in a bargaining unit represented by a union that is a signatory to this agreement.

 II. Personal Holidays:

 A covered employee who has completed eighteen thousand seven hundred and twenty (18,720) hours on regular pay status by December 31, 2006, shall receive an additional two (2) personal holidays during 2007 for a total of four (4) personal holidays,. The additional two personal holidays shall be added to the leave balance of said employees upon the effective date of the ordinance authorizing this new benefit.

 Effective January 1, 2007, covered employees who have completed eighteen thousand seven hundred and twenty (18,720) hours or more on regular pay status on or before December 31st of the current year shall receive an additional two (2) personal holidays for a total of four (4) personal holidays to be added to their leave balance on the pay date of the first full pay period in January of the following year.

 III. Holiday Pay for 4/10 Work Schedules:

 Covered employees who are not currently on a 4/10 work schedule and subsequently are assigned to work a 4/10 work schedule shall receive eight (8) hours of holiday pay for a City holiday.

 Effective December 31, 2006, a covered employee who is currently working on a 4/10 work schedule on the date this agreement is signed and who receives ten (10) hours of holiday pay for City holidays shall be grandfathered to continue to receive ten (10) hours of holiday pay for City holidays whenever he or she is working a 4/10 work schedule if the following conditions are met:

 1) The employee is continuously employed in his or her current department; and

 2) The employee is in a bargaining unit represented by a union signatory to this agreement.

 For example, a grandfathered employee who is currently assigned to work a 4/10 work schedule is assigned to work a 5/8 work schedule three months out of the year. When this employee is reassigned to work the 4/10 work schedule, he or she will then receive the ten hour holiday pay as long as he or she is assigned to work the 4/10 work schedule. While the employee is working the 5/8 work schedule, he or she shall receive eight hour holiday pay.

 Each City department shall compile a list identifying all covered employees who currently receive ten hour holidays. This list shall be finalized with the concurrence of the Coalition of City Unions and will be memorialized in a separate Letter of Agreement.
