 AN ORDINANCE relating to the construction of new fire facilities; amending the 2005 Adopted Budget, including the 2005-2010 Capital Improvement Program (CIP); amending a CIP project; making appropriations to the Fleets and Facilities Department, from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund and the 2003 Fire Facilities Fund to pay for the construction of a new Fire Station 10; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, on November 4, 2003 the voters of Seattle approved the 2003 Fire Facilities Levy, which will provide up to $167.2 million in funding to upgrade Fire Department facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the 2003 Fire Facilities Levy did not include funding for the construction of a new Fire Department Headquarters; and

 WHEREAS, the escalation of construction costs in 2004 and 2005 has significantly outpaced the forecasts used in the development of the 2003 Fire Facilities Levy and thus created potential funding challenges; and

 WHEREAS, the legislation authorizing the 2003 Fire Facilities levy identified that specific Levy projects would be designed and built to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating, "subject to the appropriation of sufficient funds to accomplish that rating while reasonably meeting other design objectives"; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30121 established as City policy that new or renovated City-owned facilities over 5,000 gross square feet of occupied space shall meet a minimum LEED Silver rating; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to pay for necessary capital costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred in 2005, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriations for the following in the 2005 Budget are increased from the funds shown, as follows:

 Item Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 1.1 Cumulative Fleets and Fire Station 10 Reserve Subfund Facilities (A1FL110) $2,200,000 - REET I Subaccount (00163)

 1.2 Cumulative Fleets and Fire Station 10 $2,800,000 Reserve Subfund Facilities (A1FL110) - REET II Subaccount (00161)

 1.3 2003 Fire Fleets and Fire Station 10 $1,000,000 Facilities Fund Facilities (A1FL110) (34440)

 Total $6,000,000

 Of the additional $6,000,000 appropriated for the Fire Station 10 project (A1FL110), $4,000,000 is appropriated solely to pay for the change order that will be negotiated by the City with the project general contractor to address the costs associated with the additional work required to prepare the project site for the potential future construction of a Fire Department headquarters function and the Fire Marshall's Office and may be used for no other purpose. No more than $2,000,000 of the additional $6,000,000 appropriated for the Fire Station 10 project (A1FL110) can be spent until the Chair of the Public Safety, Civil Rights and Arts Committee files with the City Clerk his or her certification that the Fleets and Facilities Department has provided the Council with independent cost estimates for the additional work required to prepare the project site for the potential future construction of a Fire Department headquarters function and the Fire Marshall's Office. The  appropriations made in this section shall carry forward from year to year until fully expended.

 Section 2. The description of the "Fire Station 10" project #A1FL110 in the 2005-2010 Adopted Capital Improvement Program for the Fleets and Facilities Department is amended to read as follows:

 "This project builds a new, relocated Fire Station 10. The new station houses essentially the same functions as the existing facility, potentially including a headquarters function and the Fire Marshal's Office. ~~however, t~~The existing reserve hazmat unit is slated to move to Fire Station 31. The new Fire Station 10 is co-located with a new "Fire Alarm Center" project (A1FL201) and a new "Emergency Operations Center" project (A1FL301). Operations and maintenance costs will be incorporated into future Seattle Fire Department budgets."

 Section 3. By September 30th, 2005, the Fleets and Facilities Department shall provide to the Fire Facilities Oversight Committee and the Council a revised schedule and financial plan for completion of the 2003 Fire Facilities Levy projects. This revised schedule and financial plan shall include:

 i) An updated schedule for the design, construction, completion and occupancy of all levy-funded projects and facilities;

 ii) A detailed assessment of what additional funding, if any, would be needed to ensure that all projects in the Neighborhood Stations category that include rebuilding or fully remodeling stations achieve the LEED Silver rating;

 iii) A detailed assessment of how inflationary escalation in construction costs could affect overall Levy finances, including sensitivity analysis around different assumptions regarding future construction cost inflation rates; and

 iv) A clear plan for how future inflationary costs increases in Levy projects will be managed. In particular, the Fire Facilities Oversight Committee and the Council need to understand to what degree such costs can and will be managed within existing funding (both levy and non-levy), require changes in project scope, or lead to future supplementary funding requests.

 Once such a revised schedule and financial plan is provided, Council may consider a request to appropriate an additional $1,000,000 in REET I funds, if available, to mitigate the cost increases projected for the Fire Station 10 project that are the result of higher construction inflation than was assumed in the development of the 2003 Fire Facilities Levy.

 Section 4. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, some of the foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2005 Budget.

 Section 5. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
