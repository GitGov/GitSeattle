 THIS FIRST AMENDATORY AGREEMENT is entered into by and between The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("City"), operating through its Seattle Center Department ("Seattle Center") and The Westin Seattle ("Westin"), having its principle place of business at 1900 Fifth Avenue, Seattle, Washington, 98101.

 WHEREAS, on December 30, 2002, the parties hereto entered into an agreement for the Management of Food and Beverage Services at the Marion Oliver McCaw Hall ("McCaw Hall") and the Exhibition Hall at Seattle Center, pursuant to which The Westin Seattle was authorized to provide the Seattle Center and its patrons with exclusive food and beverage concession and catering services at McCaw Hall and exclusive food and beverage concession services at the Exhibition Hall ("Agreement"); and

 WHEREAS, the Agreement provided for The Westin Seattle to pay to the City a percentage of its annual Gross Sales; and

 WHEREAS, in a separate agreement between the City of Seattle, Pacific Northwest Ballet Association and Seattle Opera (together "Resident Entities) Relating to the Use and Management of Marion Oliver McCaw Hall it is recognized that the Resident Entities have certain status, rights and responsibilities in the management and operation of McCaw Hall; and

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to modify their Agreement to reflect certain practical considerations based on the experience gained since McCaw Hall opened in June of 2003, and to recognize the contribution that the Resident Entities make to the financial sustainability of McCaw Hall; NOW, THEREFORE,

 IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises, covenants and conditions set forth in this Amendment No. 1, the parties agree as follows:

 1. The third paragraph of Section 4.9, Obligation to Actively Market for Catering Events and Share in Rental Payments, is amended to read as follows:

 The Westin shall receive a portion of all rental fees paid by a client, other than the Pacific Northwest Ballet and the Seattle Opera, for events in the front of house spaces in McCaw Hall, as shown in Exhibit E. Cancellation fees for events in the front of house spaces shall be shared equally by the Westin and Seattle Center. Seattle Center shall pay the Westin its share of the front-of-house rental fees monthly, for rents received during the previous calendar month. The Westin shall record such payments as Gross Sales in the month in which such payments are received. Seattle Center, in consultation with the Westin, shall establish and change as necessary the rental rates shown in Exhibit E, along with the Seattle Center deductions, which shall be tied to Seattle Center event costs and not unreasonably inflated.

 2. The first paragraph of Section 5.1, Percentage of Gross Sales, is amended to read as follows:

 In exchange for the grant of rights set forth in Article IV, the Westin agrees to pay to the City a percentage of its annual Gross Sales on a Monthly Accounting Period basis during each year of the term of this Agreement, in the manner set forth below and in accordance with the following graduated percentage payment schedule:

 Gross Sales Percentage

 Zero to $1,000,000 7.5% to City

 $1,000,001 to $1,500,000 8.5% to City

 $1,500,001 to $2,000,000 9.5% to City

 $2,000,001 to $2,500,000 10.5% to City

 $2,500,001 to $3,000,000 11.5% to City

 $3,000,001 and higher 12.5% to City

 For the purposes of this paragraph only and in order to establish the percentage sales due Seattle Center, Westin shall include in its calculation of cumulative Gross Sales the proceeds from Catering sales made to Pacific Northwest Ballet, Seattle Opera, Seattle Center or the Seattle Center Foundation, but no percentage payments to the City shall be due for such sales. In exchange for such payment exemption, the Westin agrees to provide Catering services to Pacific Northwest Ballet, Seattle Opera, Seattle Center and Seattle Center Foundation at prices that are 15% less than the Westin's standard prices for such Catering services.

 3. The second paragraph of Section 5.2, Timing and Form of Payments, is deleted in its entirety.

 4. Section 6.1, Monthly Report, is amended to read as follows:

All information shall be documented satisfactory to the Seattle Center, which may include requests for additional kinds of related information from time to time, formatted to correspond with the "event type" categories currently used by the Seattle Center and provided in electronic as well as paper form, utilizing a computer application Approved by the Seattle Center Director.

 5. Section 7.4, Menus, Prices and Signage, is amended to read as follows:

Client event orders and cost estimates shall clearly indicate all client costs including service charges, gratuities, labor costs and sales tax.
