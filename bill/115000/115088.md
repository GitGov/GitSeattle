 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Mercer Corridor; modifying restrictions in the 2004 Adopted Budget that limit the Seattle Department of Transportation's spending on the Mercer Corridor Project; recommending the Two-Way Mercer Boulevard and narrowed Valley Street alternative for evaluation in the NEPA and SEPA environmental review process; directing the Department of Transportation to develop options for the proposed Two-way Mercer alternative to meet certain performance improvements; and directing the Department to evaluate other measures that may help traffic flow, including an aggressive Transportation Demand Management Program for South Lake Union.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30714 recommends a Two-Way Mercer Boulevard and narrowed Valley Street alternative for evaluation in the NEPA and SEPA environmental review process; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed a budget proviso relating to the Mercer Corridor Transportation Capital Improvement Project (TCIP) limiting project spending from 2004 appropriations to $163,000; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is conducting environmental review under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) for transportation improvements in the Mercer Corridor between I-5 and Aurora Avenue North; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has expressed strong interest in changing the character of conditions of the Mercer Corridor from a freeway on- ramp to a two-way boulevard between I-5 and Fifth Avenue North at the Seattle Center and narrowing Valley Street to create a more pleasant approach to the South Lake Union Park; and

 WHEREAS, for decades people have been searching for solutions to Mercer Street problems resulting from the tangle of roads weaving through the South Lake Union neighborhood that provide access from I-5 to the Seattle Center and to the surrounding urban neighborhoods of Uptown/Queen Anne, Denny Triangle and Fremont; and

 WHEREAS, in the late 1960's the City acquired a number of properties between I-5 and SR-99 with the intention of constructing a "Bay Freeway" which was ultimately challenged in court and rejected by the voters; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 30080 in 1999 setting forth public objectives for the sale of "Bay Freeway" properties including creating an attractive gateway, promoting a safe and active pedestrian environment, enhancing visual relationships in the park vicinity, and encouraging alternative forms of transportation; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Resolution 30610 in 2003 setting forth priorities to support redevelopment of the South Lake Union area including making transportation improvements to reconnect the South Lake Union street grid and promote connections with downtown and the Seattle Center, and promoting pedestrian-oriented improvements; and

 WHEREAS, the Mercer Corridor project attempts to address a variety of objectives confirmed by project stakeholders, including: improved mobility through and within the South Lake Union area using a multi- modal approach; improved access and circulation within the neighborhood for all modes; improved regional access; provision of better connections between South Lake Union and Queen Anne; improved safety for cars, bicycles and pedestrians throughout the corridor; enhanced environment around South Lake Union Park and provision of better pedestrian connections between the neighborhood and the park/waterfront; support for economic development goals for South Lake Union, and compatibility with the City's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan envisions a community characterized by a pervasive humanly scaled ambience, variety of open spaces, and an aesthetically pleasing, safe neighborhood embracing dynamic opportunities for people to work, live and recreate with the greatest ease of mobility for all travel modes; and

 WHEREAS, Council and Executive have worked together to agree upon performance improvements for a Two-Way Mercer Boulevard and narrowed Valley Street alternative; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As adopted in Resolution 30714, the Council recommends the Two-Way Mercer Boulevard and narrowed Valley Street alternative, including any performance improvements identified in Section 2, for evaluation in the NEPA and SEPA environmental review process. This ordinance implements Resolution 30714.

 Section 2. Through the NEPA and SEPA process, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) shall develop and analyze, as part of the Two-way Mercer alternative, options that would improve overall performance of the transportation system. SDOT's analysis should be based on targets for job and housing growth contemplated for South Lake Union in the City's Comprehensive Plan update for 2004. The analysis will include:

 A. Pedestrian Improvements. SDOT shall study and evaluate pedestrian safety and access in the project area. SDOT's work shall include an analysis of the pedestrian connections to surrounding destination points and neighborhoods. The proposed Mercer project shall include the construction of sidewalks on all block faces covered by the project. It shall also include connections to adjacent pedestrian facilities and proposing measures to address pedestrian hazards.

 B. Bicycle Improvements. SDOT shall study and evaluate the current city bicycle plan as it relates to South Lake Union and propose improvements in the immediate project vicinity, which correspond to the new opportunities presented by the Mercer Corridor project. The project shall seek to increase the volume of bicycle users through the construction of bike lanes and bike paths in the immediate project vicinity. The project shall also consider constructing the connections to adjacent lanes and paths which abut the project and propose measures to eliminate hazards to bicycles in the immediate project area such as railroad crossings, stray rail tracks and sight distance hazards.

 C. Transit Improvements. SDOT shall study and evaluate the operation of transit in the South Lake Union area with the purpose of increasing the reliability of transit, thereby seeking to increase the volume of transit users. Specifically, SDOT will pursue transit prioritization and other means to improve the predictability of the transit trip over auto travel. SDOT shall also study and propose a future transit plan, which expands the access and frequency of transit to the area. Although, the Mercer project is not expected to provide the added transit service itself, the Mercer Project shall evaluate physical road accommodations for transit such as bus pullouts, wider sidewalks, transit priority signals and bus lanes, where appropriate.

 D. On-street Parking. SDOT shall study and evaluate the degree to which parking management techniques, including the elimination of on- street parking, will be effective in improving mobility for all modes of travel.

 E. Freight Mobility. The analysis for Mercer Corridor improvements shall contain analysis of how such improvements will facilitate movement of freight efficiently and reliably.

 Section 3. SDOT shall study and evaluate separately from the Mercer environmental review other measures that may help traffic flow and circulation in the South Lake Union area, improve access to Seattle Center, and ease congestion throughout the Mercer Corridor. At a minimum this shall include:

 A. Analyzing and evaluating the management of the traffic flow from I- 5, including the weave of traffic originating from SR-520, improving the off-ramps at Stewart and Denny, widening Denny Way, implementation of new reversible lanes through the Mercer Corridor, and restricting single occupancy vehicles from using the Mercer on- ramp to the I-5 express lanes. In addition, the analysis will include studying and evaluating alternative combinations, such as implementation of reversible lanes in conjunction with SR-520 improvements, likely to improve traffic and reduce congestion. SDOT shall make this mandated study and analysis a priority for completion and, if appropriate, will incorporate these findings into the Mercer project environmental review process.

 B. Analyzing financing options for the Mercer project including the use of impact fees authorized under the Growth Management Act and/or mitigation fees. Analysis of impact fees shall include a possible fee structure, whereby new growth expected in the South Lake Union Area would pay a proportionate share of the costs of facilities to serve the new growth, and a review of how other jurisdictions have used impact fees.

 Council shall receive and consider all analyses requested in this Section prior to the finalization of the NEPA Environmental Assessment. SDOT shall provide quarterly progress reports regarding the Mercer Corridor analysis described in this Section to the Transportation Committee of the Council. In addition, SDOT shall confer with the Chair of the Transportation Committee and with other Councilmembers and Council Central Staff regarding significant strategic, policy or budgetary issues.

 Section 4. Separate from the Mercer environmental review SDOT shall develop and implement an aggressive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program for South Lake Union to reduce dependency on private automobiles, encourage alternative modes of travel and enhance access and mobility for people traveling within and through the South Lake Union area. At a minimum this shall consider: expanding trip choices by making a variety of bicycle improvements (lanes, way finding, paths, amenities at trip destinations); encouraging ridesharing and providing priority access for high-occupancy vehicles (HOV) to and from I-5 as well as preferred parking access on neighborhood streets; encouraging shifts to transit and HOV by implementing parking pricing, parking cash-out programs, providing priority treatment for transit within the Mercer Corridor and managing Seattle Center special event traffic in favor of transit or HOVs; managing parking by promoting shared parking or parking brokerage programs; and working with neighborhood and business organizations to support TDM strategies especially useful in South Lake Union. SDOT's analysis should estimate the changed South Lake Union modal split resulting from the TDM and the mobility benefits deriving from it. SDOT shall present a TDM program before December 15, 2005 to the Council. By the end of 2005 SDOT will accomplish the following work:

 1. Conduct assessment of existing parking conditions, land uses, and anticipated land use changes over the next five years

 2. Perform geographic analysis of parking, transit and land use data

 3. Develop specific recommendations for near term transition strategies

 4. Analyze existing and projected workforce demographics

 5. Evaluate mechanisms to allow for development funded transit service

 6. Conduct outreach to develop support for development funded transit.

 Section 5. The following 2004 budget proviso is modified as shown.

 Department Green Sheet # Proviso Project ID(s)

 Seattle #098-1-B-5 "No more than ~~$163,000~~ TC365500 Department of $1,830,000 of the money Transportation appropriated in 2004 for Seattle Transportation, can be spent to pay for the Mercer Corridor TCIP (project ID 365500) until authorized by future ordinance. Of the appropriation in the Transportation Policy and Planning - Policy, Planning, and Major Project Development BCL in the 2004 budget for Seattle Department of Transportation, $1,830,000 may be spent only for the NEPA and SEPA environmental review that includes an Environmental Assessment and an Environmental Impact Statement, if required, and the additional analysis, evaluation, and program development described in Sections 2 through 7 of this ordinance. That $1,830,000 may be spent for no other purpose. Council believes this amount is sufficient for thorough environmental review, including an EIS if required, and does not anticipate appropriating additional money for completion of environmental review.~~The Council anticipates that such authority will not be granted until the Council approves a set of alternatives to be considered in an EIS. The Council and the Executive will work together to agree on standards for inclusion of alternatives in an EIS and the information necessary to support those standards~~."

 Section 6. SDOT shall continue to coordinate the Mercer Corridor project with the Alaskan Way Viaduct project. SDOT will study separately from the Mercer environmental review how Mercer Corridor improvements will facilitate movement of traffic during reconstruction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct. In particular, the impact analysis should show how additional traffic demands during Alaskan Way Viaduct reconstruction affect congestion in South Lake Union and what is proposed to mitigate any congestion. In addition, SDOT's study shall consider the proposed over-crossings of five east- west streets between Thomas and Roy Streets and the elimination of Broad Street in conjunction with the performance of the Mercer Corridor improvements. Prior to finalization of the NEPA Environmental Assessment, SDOT shall provide Council with the analysis described in this Section.

 Section 7: If it is determined in the NEPA and SEPA environmental review process that a full NEPA Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required for evaluation of the Mercer Corridor project, prior to proceeding with an EIS, the Council shall be given the opportunity to review and approve by ordinance a set of alternatives to be included in the EIS.

 Section 8. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after Council passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
