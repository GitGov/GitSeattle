 PREAMBLE

 This Agreement is between the City of Seattle (hereinafter called the City) and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 32 (hereinafter called the Union) for the purpose of setting forth the mutual understanding of the parties as to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment of those employees for whom the City has recognized the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative.

 ARTICLE 1 -- NON-DISCRIMINATION

 1.1 The City and the Union shall not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the operations of the City.

 1.1.1 Wherever words denoting a specific gender are used in the Agreement, they are intended and shall be construed so as to apply equally to either gender.

 1.2 Allegations of discrimination shall not be a proper subject for the grievance procedure herein but instead may be filed by a complaint with the appropriate human rights agency.

 ARTICLE 2 -- RECOGNITION, BARGAINING UNIT, AND

 TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT

 2.1 The City recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the purpose stated in Chapter 108, Extra Session Laws of 1967 of the State of Washington for employees employed within the bargaining unit defined in Appendices A and B of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement and the bargaining unit described herein the following definitions shall apply:

 2.1.1 The term "employee" shall be defined to include probationary employees, regular employees, full-time employees, part-time employees and temporary employees not otherwise excluded or limited in the following Sections of this Article.

 2.1.2 The term "probationary employee" shall be defined as an employee who is within his/her first twelve (12) month trial period of employment following his/her initial regular appointment within the classified service from an eligible register.

 2.1.3 The term "apprentice" shall be defined as an employee whose terms and conditions of employment are set forth in an "agreement of apprenticeship" which terms shall govern when they conflict with any terms and conditions herein. Apprenticeship programs are authorized by RCW 49.04 and Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.200 B which designates a Joint Advisory Apprenticeship Committee to administer such programs. At the time of the signing of this Agreement, the applicable apprentice title is Water Pipe Worker Apprentice. Other apprentice titles will be included within this definition as they are adopted by the Joint Advisory Committee, approved by the state, adopted by the City Council, and incorporated into this Agreement by an amending Memorandum of Understanding.

 2.1.4 The term "regular employee" shall be defined as an employee who has successfully completed a twelve (12) month probationary period and who has had no subsequent break in service as occasioned by quit, resignation, discharge for just cause, or retirement.

 2.1.5 The term "full-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule of forty (40) hours per week.

 2.1.6 The term "part-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule averaging at least twenty (20) hours but less than forty (40) hours per week.

 2.1.7 The term "temporary employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been hired to work during any period when additional work requires a temporarily augmented work force, in the event of an emergency, to fill in for the absence of a regular employee, or to fill a vacancy in a permanent position on an interim basis. Work performed by a temporary employee may include, but not necessarily be limited to a variety of work schedules dependent upon the requirements of a particular temporary job assignment; e.g., full-time in assignments of limited duration; less than forty (40) hours per week; less than twenty (20) hours per week; as needed; seasonal; on call; or intermittent.

 2.1.8 The term "interim basis" shall be defined as an assignment of an employee or employees to fill a vacancy in a position for a short period while said position is waiting to be filled by a regularly appointed employee.

 2.2 Temporary employees shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement except Sections 2.2; 2.2.1; 2.2.2; 2.2.2.1; 2.2.2.2; 2.2.3; 2.2.4; 2.2.5; 2.2.6; 2.2.7; 2.2.8; 2.2.9; 2.2.10; 2.2.11; 18.1.4; 18.1.4.1; 18.1.4.2; 19.1; Article 4, Union Security, Section 4.1.2 and Article 5, Grievance Procedure; provided however, temporary employees shall be covered by the Grievance Procedure solely for purposes of adjudicating grievances relating to Sections identified within this Section.

 2.2.1 Temporary employees shall be paid for all hours worked at the first Pay Step of the hourly rates of pay set forth within the appropriate Appendix covering the classification of work in which he/she is employed.

 2.2.2 Premiums Applicable Only to City of Seattle Temporary Employees -- Each temporary employee shall receive premium pay as hereinafter set forth based upon the corresponding number of cumulative non-overtime hours worked by the temporary employee:

 0001st hour through 0520th hour 5% premium pay

 0521st hour through 1,040th hour 10% premium pay

 1,041st hour through 2,080th hour 15% premium pay (If an employee worked eight hundred [800] hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty percent [20%] premium pay.)

 2,081st hour + 20% premium pay (If an employee worked eight hundred [800] hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty-five percent [25%] premium pay.)

 The appropriate percentage premium payment shall be applied to all gross earnings.

 2.2.2.1 Once a temporary employee reaches a given premium level, the premium shall not be reduced for that temporary employee as long as the employee continues to work for the City without a voluntary break in service as set forth within Section 2.2.8. Non-overtime hours already worked by an existing temporary employee shall apply in determining the applicable premium rate. In view of the escalating and continuing nature of the premium, the City may require that a temporary employee be available to work for a minimum number of hours or periods of time during the year.

 2.2.2.2 The premium pay in Section 2.2.2 does not include either increased vacation pay due to accrual rate increases or the City's share of any retirement contributions. Any increase in a temporary employee's vacation accrual rate percentage shall be added on to the premium pay percentages for the temporary employee to whom it applies.

 2.2.3 Temporary Employee Medical and Dental Eligibility -- Once a temporary employee has worked at least one thousand forty (1,040) cumulative non-overtime hours and at least eight hundred (800) non- overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, he/she may within ninety (90) calendar days thereafter elect to participate in the City's medical and dental insurance programs by agreeing to pay the required monthly premium. To participate the temporary employee must agree to a payroll deduction equal to the amount necessary to pay the monthly health care premiums; or the City, at its discretion, may reduce the premium pay of the employee who chooses this option in an amount equal to the insurance premiums. The temporary employee must continue to work enough hours each month to pay the premiums and maintain eligibility. After meeting the hours worked requirement a temporary employee shall also be allowed to elect this option during any subsequent open period allowed regular employees. An employee who elects to participate in these insurance programs and fails to make the required payments in a timely fashion shall be dropped from City medical and dental coverage and shall not be able to participate again while employed by the City as a temporary employee. If a temporary employee's hours of work are insufficient for his/her pay to cover the insurance premium, the temporary employee may, on no more than one occasion, pay the difference or self-pay the insurance premium for up to three (3) consecutive months.

 2.2.4 Temporary Employee Holiday Work Premium Pay -- A temporary employee who works on any of the specific calendar days designated by the City as paid holidays shall be paid at the rate of one and one- half (1-1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for hours worked during his/her scheduled shift. When a specific holiday falls on a weekend day and most regular employees honor the holiday on the preceding Friday or following Monday adjacent to the holiday, the holiday premium pay of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's regular straight-time rate of pay shall apply to those temporary employees who work on the weekend day specified as the holiday.

 2.2.5 A temporary employee who is scheduled to work regularly or on and off throughout the year and who has worked two thousand eighty (2,080) cumulative non-overtime hours without a voluntary break in service and who has also worked eight hundred (800) non-overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, may request an unpaid leave of absence not to exceed the amount of vacation time he/she would have earned in the previous year if he/she had not received vacation premium pay in lieu of annual paid vacation. Where such requests are made, the timing and scheduling of such unpaid leaves must be agreeable to the employing department. The leave shall be handled in a manner similar to the scheduling of vacation for permanent employees. This provision shall not be applicable in cases where a temporary employee accrues vacation time rather than premium pay as set forth within Section 2.2.7.

 2.2.6 Premium pay set forth within Section 2.2.2 shall be in lieu of the base level of vacation and all other fringe benefits; such as, sick leave, holiday pay, funeral leave, military leave, jury duty pay, disability leave, and medical and dental insurance, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.2.2.2; 2.2.3; and 2.2.4.

 2.2.7 The City may, at any time after ninety (90) calendar days advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide all fringe benefits covered by the premium pay set forth within Section 2.2.2 to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees within the same group, and in such event the premium pay provision in Section 2.2.2 shall no longer be applicable to that particular group of temporary employees. The City, at its discretion, may also after ninety (90) calendar days advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide paid vacation and/or sick leave benefits to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees without providing other fringe benefits; and in such event the premium pay in Section 2.2.2 shall be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to the value of vacation and/or sick leave benefits. The applicable amount for base-level vacation shall be recognized as four point eight one percent (4.81%) which could be higher dependent upon accrual rate increases. The applicable amount for base-level sick leave shall be four point six percent (4.6%). The City shall not use this option to change to and from premiums and benefits on an occasional basis. The City may also continue to provide benefits in lieu of all or part of

 the premiums in Section 2.2.2 where it has already been doing so; and it may in such cases reduce the premium paid to the affected employees by the applicable percentage.

 2.2.8 The premium pay provisions set forth within Section 2.2.2 shall apply to cumulative non-overtime hours that occur without a voluntary break in service by the temporary employee. A voluntary break in service shall be defined as quit, resignation, service retirement or failure to return from an unpaid leave. If the temporary employee has not worked for at least one year (12 months or 26 pay periods) it shall be presumed that the employee's break in service was voluntary.

 2.2.9 The City may work temporary employees beyond one thousand forty (1,040) regular hours within any twelve (12) month period; provided however, the City shall not use temporary employees to supplant permanent positions. The City shall not assign or schedule temporary employees (or fail to do so) solely to avoid accumulation of regular hours that would increase the premium pay provided for in Section 2.2.2 or solely to avoid considering creation of permanent positions.

 2.2.10 A temporary employee who has worked in excess of five hundred twenty (520) regular hours and who is appointed to a permanent position without a voluntary break in service greater than thirty (30) days shall have his/her time worked counted for purposes of salary step placement (where appropriate) and eligibility for medical and dental benefits under Article 12.

 2.2.11 Temporary employees covered by this agreement who have worked for the City for 1,040 hours without a break in service are eligible to apply for vacant positions.

 2.3 The City participates in programs or may establish programs that result in individuals performing work for the City that would otherwise be performed by employees in positions covered by this Bargaining Agreement. Such programs have included and may include: youth training and employment programs; federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) or similar program; "Project Hire"; vocational rehabilitation programs; work study and student intern programs; work fare programs; court-ordered community service; volunteer and other programs with similar purposes. Such individuals shall be exempt from all of the provisions of this Agreement.

 If employees hired pursuant to such programs will be assigned to perform work that requires a special occupational license or certification (other than licenses for driving), the City will first notify the Union. The Union may open for negotiation whether these employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this Agreement under this Section 2.3 or not.

 2.4 The City may establish preparatory training programs, including on-the-job training, for the purpose of providing individuals an opportunity to compete and potentially move laterally or upward into new career fields. It is understood that on-the-job training may involve bargaining unit work even though the "trainee" is not covered by this Agreement. It is also understood that said trainees will not be used for the purpose of displacing regular employees. Employees involved in such upward mobility programs shall not have their original bargaining unit status affected by such plan and shall continue to receive the salary of their regularly-assigned position. The City will furnish the Union a copy of such training plan(s) prior to implementation if they affect bargaining unit employees.

 ARTICLE 3 -- LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES

 3.1 The City and Union agree to hold labor-management meetings as necessary. These meetings will be called upon request of either party to discuss contract or non-contract issues affecting employees covered by this Agreement. Subjects for discussion at labor-management meetings during the term of this Agreement shall be as agreed by the parties. The Union shall be permitted to designate members and/or stewards in affected department(s) to assist its Union Representatives in such meetings. The purpose of labor-management meetings is to deal with matters of general concern to the Union and management.

 3.1.1 Interdepartment Labor-Management Committees will be a forum for addressing workplace issues that affect more than one City department. Membership will be made up of management from the affected departments, Labor Relations, Local 32 Union Representatives, and employees/stewards from the participating departments.

 3.1.2 Intradepartment Labor-Management Committees will be a forum for addressing issues in a single department. Membership will be made up of management, Labor Relations, Local 32 Union Representatives, and employees/stewards. This committee will also be the vehicle that charters Employee Involvement Committees.

 3.1.3 Work Unit Labor-Management Committees will be a forum for addressing issues that affect a work unit in one department. Membership will be made up of management, Labor Relations, Local 32 Union Representatives, and employees/stewards.

 Note: 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 may include Union Representatives from other Unions.

 3.2 Labor-Management Leadership Committee -- The Labor-Management Leadership Committee will be a forum for communication and cooperation between labor and management to support the delivery of high-quality,

 cost-effective service to the citizens of Seattle while maintaining a high-quality work environment for City employees.

 The management representatives to the Committee will be determined in accordance with the Labor-Management Leadership Committee Charter. The Coalition of City Unions will appoint a minimum of six (6) labor representatives and a maximum equal to the number of management representatives of the Committee. The co-chairs of the Coalition will be members of the Leadership Committee.

 ARTICLE 4 -- UNION MEMBERSHIP AND DUES

 4.1 It shall be a condition of employment that each employee covered by this Agreement who voluntarily is or who voluntarily becomes a member of said Union shall remain a member of same during the term of this Agreement. It shall also be a condition of employment that each employee hired prior to January 1, 1975, currently covered by this Agreement, who is not a member of the Union shall on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following said date either join the appropriate Union or contribute an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union to the Union. Any employee hired or permanently assigned into a bargaining unit job title or position covered by this Agreement on or after January 1, 1975, shall on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such employment join the Union or pay an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union to the Union. Failure by any such employee to apply for and/or maintain such membership or pay to the Union an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union in accordance with this provision shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, the requirements to apply for Union membership and/or maintain Union membership shall be satisfied by an offer of the employee to pay the regular initiation fee and the regular dues uniformly required by the Union of its members.

 4.1.1 Employees covered by this Agreement who satisfy the religious exemption criteria of RCW 41.56.122 shall contribute an amount equivalent to regular Union initiation fees and regular Union dues to a nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such employee would otherwise pay the regular monthly dues.

 4.1.2 A temporary employee shall, after having worked one hundred seventy-four 174 straight-time hours, pay to the Union in lieu of the Union membership requirement of Article 4 a service fee in an amount equal to the Union's regular monthly dues uniformly required of regular City employees for each one hundred seventy-four (174) straight-time hours worked thereafter within the bargaining unit.

 4.2 When an employee fails to fulfill the above obligation, the Union shall provide the employee and the City with thirty (30) days written notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action; and during this period the employee may make restitution in the amount that is overdue. If an employee has not fulfilled the Union membership obligation as described in Section 4.1 by the end of the applicable discharge notification period, the Union shall thereafter notify the City Director of Labor Relations in writing, with a copy to the affected department and employee, of such employee's failure to abide by Section 4.1. In this notice the Union shall specifically request discharge of the employee for failure to abide by the terms of the Labor Agreement between the City and the Union.

 4.3 The City shall deduct from the pay check of each employee who has so authorized it, the regular initiation fee and regular monthly dues uniformly required of members of the Union. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Union on behalf of the employees involved. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties hereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request.

 4.3.1 The performance of this function shall be recognized as a service to the Union by the City.

 4.3.2 The Union agrees to indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all liability arising out of this Article.

 ARTICLE 5 -- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

 5.1 Any dispute between the City and the Union concerning the interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of the express terms of this Agreement shall be deemed a grievance. An employee at any time may present a grievance to the City and have such grievance adjusted without the intervention of the Union, if the adjustment is not inconsistent with the expressed terms of this Agreement and if the Union has been given reasonable opportunity to be present at any initial meeting called for the resolution of such grievance.

 5.1.1 Reclassification grievances shall be processed per Section 5.12.

 5.2 The City and the Union encourage the use of the City's Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program or other ADR processes to resolve non-contractual workplace conflicts/disputes. Participation in the City's ADR Program or in another ADR process is entirely voluntary and confidential.

 5.3 A grievance in the interest of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be reduced to writing by the Union and may be introduced at Step 3 of the grievance procedure and be processed within the time limits set forth herein.

 5.4 As a means of facilitating settlement of a grievance, either party may include an additional member at its expense on its committee. If, at any step in the grievance procedure, management's answer in writing is unsatisfactory, the Union's reason for nonacceptance must be presented in writing.

 5.5 Failure by an employee or the Union to comply with any time limitation of the procedure in this Article shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance; provided, however, any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing.

 5.6 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be made retroactive beyond the date of the occurrence or nonoccurrence upon which the grievance is based, that date being twenty (20) business days or less prior to the initial filing of the grievance.

 5.7 A grievance shall be processed in accordance with the following procedures:

 5.7.1 (Step 1) -- The grievance shall be reduced to written form which shall include identification of the Section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated and the violation. The Union representative or employee shall forward the written grievance to the management supervisor and the Union representative within twenty (20) business days after the alleged contract violation. The management supervisor shall thereafter convene a meeting within ten (10) business days between the Union representative and aggrieved employee, together with the designated supervisor, the section manager and any other members of management whose presence is deemed necessary by the City to a fair consideration of the alleged grievance. The management supervisor shall give a written answer to the Union within ten (10) business days after the grievance meeting.

 5.7.2 (Step 2) -- If the grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 1 above, the Union representative or employee shall then forward the written grievance as presented in Step 1 to the division head with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union representative within ten (10) business days after the Step 1 answer.

 With Mediation:

 At the time the aggrieved employee and/or the Union submits the grievance to the division head, the Union representative or the aggrieved employee or the division head may submit a written request for voluntary mediation assistance, with a copy to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Coordinator, the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union representative. If the ADR Coordinator determines that the case is in line with the protocols and procedures of the ADR process, within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for voluntary mediation assistance, the ADR Coordinator or his/her designee will schedule a mediation conference and make the necessary arrangements for the selection of a mediator(s). The mediator(s) will serve as an impartial third party who will encourage and facilitate a resolution to the dispute. The mediation conference(s) will be confidential and will include the parties. The Union representative and a Labor Negotiator from City Labor Relations may attend the mediation conference(s). Other persons may attend with the permission of the mediator(s) and both parties. If the parties agree to settle the matter, the mediator(s) will assist in drafting a settlement agreement, which the parties shall sign. An executed copy of the settlement agreement shall be provided to the parties, with either a copy or a signed statement of the disposition of the grievance submitted to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement shall be provided by the parties to the department's designated officials who need to assist in implementing the agreement. If the grievance is not settled within ten (10) business days of the initial mediation conference date, the City Director of Labor Relations, the appropriate division head and the appropriate Union representative shall be so informed by the ADR Coordinator.

 The parties to a mediation shall have no power through a settlement agreement to add to, subtract from, alter, change, or modify the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or to create a precedent regarding the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or to apply the settlement agreement to any circumstance beyond the explicit dispute applicable to said settlement agreement.

 If the grievance is not resolved through mediation, the division head shall convene a meeting within ten (10) business days after receipt of notification that the grievance was not resolved through mediation between the aggrieved employee and Union representative together with the division head, section manager and department labor relations officer. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend said meeting. Within ten (10) business days after the meeting, the division head shall forward a reply to the Union.

 12.2.2 The maximum monthly premium cost to the Employer shall be no more than the monthly premium rates established for calendar year 2004 for the base plan; provided, further, such cost shall not exceed the maximum limitation on the Employer's premium obligation per calendar year as set forth within Section 12.2.

 12.3 Life Insurance -- The City shall offer a voluntary Group Term Life Insurance option to eligible employees. The employee shall pay sixty percent (60%) of the monthly premium and the City shall pay forty percent (40%) of the monthly premium at a premium rate established by the City and the carrier. Premium rebates received by the City from the voluntary Group Term Life Insurance option shall be administered as provided for below.

 12.3.1 Commencing with the signing of this Agreement, future premium rebates shall be divided so that forty percent (40%) can be used by the City to pay for the City's share of the monthly premiums, and sixty percent (60%) shall be used for benefit of employees participating in the Group Term Life Insurance Plan in terms of benefit improvements to pay the employee's share of the monthly premiums or for life insurance purposes otherwise negotiated.

 12.3.2 The City will offer an option for employees to purchase additional life insurance coverage for themselves and/or their families.

 12.4 Long-term Care -- The City may offer an option for employees to purchase a new long-term care benefit for themselves and certain family members.

 ARTICLE 13 -- INDUSTRIAL INJURY OR ILLNESS

 13.1 Any employee who is disabled in the discharge of his/her duties and if such disablement results in absence from his/her regular duties, shall be compensated, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed two hundred and sixty-one (261) regularly-scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly- scheduled workday after the day of the on-the-job injury; provided the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts.

 13.1.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on no pay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then: (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized due to absence from his/her regular duties as provided for in this Section shall be reinstated, and the employee shall be paid in accordance with Section 13.1, which provides payment at the eighty percent (80%) rate; or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 13.1.

 13.1.2 Such compensation shall be authorized by the Personnel Director or his/her designee with the advice of such employee's department head on request from the employee supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 13.1.3 In no circumstances will the amount paid under these provisions exceed the normal take-home pay of an employee. This provision shall become effective when SMC 4.44, Disability Compensation, is revised to incorporate this limit.

 13.1.4 Employees must meet the standards listed in SMC 4.44.020 to be eligible for the benefit amount provided herein, which exceeds the rate required to be paid by state law, hereinafter referred to as supplemental benefits. These standards require that employees: (1) comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing department

 policies and procedures; (2) respond, be available, for and attend medical appointments and treatments and meetings related to rehabilitation and work hardening, conditioning, or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician; (3) accept modified or alternative duty assigned by supervisors when released to perform such duty by the attending physician; (4) attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Workers' Compensation unit or employing department concerning the employee's status or claim when properly notified at least five (5) working days in advance of such meeting unless other medical treatment conflicts with the meeting and the employee provides twenty-four (24) hours' notice of such meeting or examination.

 The City will provide a copy of the eligibility requirements to employees when they file a workers' compensation claim. If records indicate two (2) no-shows, supplemental benefits may be terminated no sooner than seven (7) calendar days after notification to the employee. -- --

 13.2 Compensation for holidays and earned vacation falling within a period of absence due to such disability shall be at the normal rate of pay but such days shall not be considered as regularly scheduled workdays as applied to the time limitations set forth within Section 9.1. Disabled employees affected by the provisions of SMC 4.44 shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though actively employed during the period set forth within Section 13.1.

 13.3 Any employee eligible for the benefits provided by this Ordinance whose disability prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties but, in the judgment of his/her physician, could perform duties of a less strenuous nature shall be employed at his/her normal rate of pay in such other suitable duties as the department head shall direct with the approval of such employee's physician until the Personnel Director requests closure of such employee's claim pursuant to SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 13.4 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 13.1 or as may be otherwise allowed by SMC 4.44.

 13.5 The afore-referenced disability compensation shall be understood to be in lieu of State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid.

 13.6 Appeals of any denials under this Article shall be made through the Department of Labor and Industries as prescribed in Title 51 R.C.W.

 ARTICLE 14 -- UNION REPRESENTATIVES

 14.1 Union Visitation -- The Union Representative of the Union party to this Agreement and/or the duly authorized representative may, after notifying the City official in charge, visit the work location of employees covered by this Agreement at any reasonable time during working hours. For purposes of this Section, "City official in charge" shall mean the supervisor in charge of the work area to be visited or, if the work area is located outside of the corporate limits of the City of Seattle, the "City official in charge" shall mean the official in charge of the particular facility (e.g., Skagit Project) or the official designated by the affected department. The Union Representative shall limit his/her activities during such visit to matters relating to this Agreement. Such visits shall not interfere with work functions of the department. City work hours shall not be used by employee and/or the Union Representative for the conduct of Union business or the promotion of Union affairs other than stated above.

 14.2 The Union may appoint a Shop Steward in the various City departments affected by this Agreement. Immediately after appointment of its Shop Steward(s), the Union shall furnish the City Personnel Office and the affected department(s) with a list of those employees who have been designated as Shop Stewards, and failure to do so will result in non-recognition by the City of the Shop Stewards. Such list shall also be updated as needed. Stewards shall be employees covered by this Agreement and shall perform their regular duties as such but shall function as the Union's representative on the job to inform the Union of any alleged violations of this Agreement and process grievances relating thereto. The Steward shall be allowed reasonable time, at the discretion of the City, to process contract grievances during regular working hours.

 14.2.1 Shop Stewards shall not be discriminated against for making a complaint or giving evidence with respect to an alleged violation of any provision of this Agreement, but under no circumstances shall Stewards interfere with orders of the employer or change working conditions.

 14.2.2 If a normal shift or work assignment rotation will result in the transfer of a Union Shop Steward to another shift or work location (reporting headquarters), the Union and Shop Steward will be given a notice of at least two weeks (no less than fourteen (14) calendar days). Upon the request of the Union Business Representative, the affected management Director shall meet to discuss the transfer.

 14.2.3 Employee Participation in Collective Bargaining -- The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspective(s) as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective August 18, 2004, employees who participate in bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

 1. Bargaining preparation and meetings of the Union's bargaining team other than actual negotiations shall not be applicable to this provision;

 2. No more than an aggregate of one hundred (150) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision.

 3. If the aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours is exceeded, the Union shall reimburse the City for the cost of said employee(s) time, including any associated overtime costs.

 ARTICLE 15 -- WORK OUTSIDE OF CLASSIFICATION

 15.1 Work Out of Class is a management tool, the purpose of which is to complete or provide essential public services. Whenever an employee is assigned by the proper authority to perform the normal, ongoing duties of and accept responsibility of a higher-paid position when the duties of the higher position are clearly outside the scope of an employee's regular classification for a period of three (3) consecutive hours or longer, he/she shall be paid at the out-of-class salary rate while performing such duties and accepting such responsibility. The out-of-class salary rate shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion. "Proper authority" shall be a supervisor, manager, or director directly above the position that is being filled out of class, who has budget management authority of the work unit as determined by the department head. Employees must meet the minimum qualifications of the higher class and must have demonstrated or be able to demonstrate their ability to perform the duties of the class. Upon the request by the Union, the City shall provide documentation of a Washington State journey-level plumber's license for those employees who are currently assigned to work out of class in the Plumber job classification. The City may work employees out of class across bargaining unit jurisdictions for a period not to exceed six (6) continuous months. The six- (6) month period may be exceeded under the following circumstances: (1) when a hiring freeze exists and vacancies cannot be filled; (2) extended industrial or off- the-job injury or disability; (3) when a position is scheduled for abrogation; (4) a position is encumbered (an assignment in lieu of a layoff; e.g., as with the renovation of the Seattle Center Coliseum. When such circumstances require that an out-of-class assignment be extended beyond six (6) months, the employer shall notify the Union or Unions that represent the employee who is so assigned and/or the body of work that is being performed on an out-of-class basis. After nine (9) months, the Union that represents the body of work being worked out of class must concur with any additional extension of the assignment. The Union that represents the body of work will consider all requests on a good faith basis.

 15.1.1 An out-of-class assignment shall be formally made in advance of the out-of-class opportunity created in normal operating conditions. Where the work is not authorized in advance, it is the responsibility of the proper authority to determine immediately how to accomplish the duties that would otherwise constitute an out-of-class assignment. Any employee may request that this determination be made. The employee will not carry out any duty of the higher-level position when such duty is not also a duty of his or her own classification if the employee is not formally assigned to perform the duties on an out- of-class basis.

 15.1.2 No employee may assume the duties of the higher-paid position without being formally assigned to do so except in a bona fide emergency. When an employee has assumed an out-of-class role in a bona fide emergency, the individual may apply to his/her department head for retroactive payment of out-of-class pay. The decision of the department head as to whether the duties were performed and whether performance thereof was appropriate shall be final.

 15.1.3 The practice of no out-of-class pay for paid leave will continue.

 15.1.4 When an employee is assigned to perform out-of-class duties in the same title for a total of twelve (12) months (each 2088 hours) of actual service, they will receive one step increment in the higher paid title; provided that they have not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 15.1.5 Hours worked out-of-class that were properly paid per this Article, shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee is appointed or their position is reclassified to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 15.2 An employee may be temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a lower classification without a reduction in pay. When employees voluntarily apply for and voluntarily accept a position in a lower- level classification, they shall receive the salary rate for the lower class; which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class. For such temporary

 period, the employee shall continue to pay dues and belong to the Union he always belonged to. The overtime provisions applicable are those of the contract covering the bargaining unit position of the work being performed on an overtime basis. At management's discretion, an employee may be temporarily assigned the duties of a lower-level class or the duties of a class with the same pay rate range as his/her primary class, across Union jurisdictional lines, with no change to his or her regular pay rate. Out-of-class provisions related to threshold for payment, salary step placement, service credit for salary step placement, and payment for absences do not apply in these instances.

 15.2.1 An employee who is temporarily unable to perform the regular duties of his/her classification due to an off-the-job injury or illness may opt to perform work within a lower paying classification dependent upon the availability of such work and subject to the approval of the Employer. The involved employee shall receive the salary rate for the lower class that without increase is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class.

 15.3 Seattle Public Utilities personnel working out of classification as an acting supervisor will not receive overtime pay pursuant to this contract but shall receive the appropriate supervisory hourly rate of pay.

 15.4 Water Pipe Workers who do not meet the minimum qualifications for Senior Water Pipe Worker, when assigned responsibility for a crew and crew vehicle, shall be paid out-of-class pay at the Senior Water Pipe Worker rate.

 15.4.1 No out-of-class compensation shall be paid for operating a crew vehicle as a means of transporting personnel to and from a job location only.

 15.4.2 All out-of-class pay in this Section shall be subject to the provisions of Section 15.1.

 15.4.3 If an employee is assigned by the department head or designee, pursuant to this Article, to perform the duties of a higher classification on a continuous basis in excess of sixty (60) calendar

 days, they thereafter, while still assigned at the higher level, will be compensated for sick leave, vacation, and holidays at the rate of the assigned higher classification.

 15.4.4

 17.2.2 An employee shall attain regular employee status after having completed his/her probationary period unless the individual is dismissed under provisions of Section 17.3.

 17.3 Probationary Period/Dismissal -- An employee may be dismissed during his/her probationary period after having been given written notice five (5) working days prior to the effective date of dismissal. However, if the department believes the best interest of the Employer requires the immediate dismissal of the probationary employee, written notice of only one (1) full working day prior to the effective date of the dismissal shall be required. The reasons for the dismissal shall be filed with the Director of Personnel and a copy sent to the Union.

 17.3.1 An employee dismissed during his/her probationary period shall not have the right to appeal the dismissal. When proper advance notice of the dismissal is not given, the employee may enter an appeal for payment of up to five (5) days salary which the employee would have otherwise received had proper notice been given. If such a claim is sustained, the employee shall be entitled to the appropriate payment of salary but shall not be entitled to reinstatement.

 17.4 Trial Service Period -- The trial service period shall provide the department with the opportunity to observe the employee's work and to train and aid the employee in adjustment to the position, and to revert such an employee whose work performance fails to meet required standards.

 17.4.1 An employee who has been appointed from one classification to another classification within the same or different department and who fails to satisfactorily complete the trial service period shall be reverted to a position within the former department (if applicable) in the classification from which he/she was appointed.

 17.4.2 Where no such vacancy exists, such employee shall be given fifteen (15) calendar days' written notice prior to being placed on a Reversion Recall List for his/her former department and former classification and being removed from the payroll.

 17.4.3 An employee's trial service period may be extended up to three (3) additional months by written mutual agreement between the department, the employee and the Union, subject to approval by the Personnel Director prior to expiration of the trial service period.

 17.4.4 Employees who have been reverted during the trial service period shall not have the right to appeal the reversion.

 17.4.5 The names of regular employees who have been reverted for purposes of re-employment in their former department shall be placed upon a Reversion Recall List for the same classification from which they were appointed for a period of one (1) year from the date of reversion.

 17.4.6 If a vacancy is to be filled in a department and a valid Reversion Recall List for the classification for that vacancy contains the name(s) of eligible employees who have been removed from the payroll from that classification and from that department, such employees shall be reinstated in order of their length of service in that classification. The employee who has the most service in that classification shall be the first reinstated.

 17.4.8 If an employee elects not to accept an offer of employment in a position essentially the same that the employee previously held, the employee's name shall be removed from the Reversion Recall List and the employee's record shall reflect a quit.

 17.4.9 A reverted employee shall be paid at the step of the range which he/she normally would have received had he/she not been appointed to another classification.

 17.5 Subsequent Appointments During Probationary Period Or Trial Service Period -- If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with approval of the Personnel Director, require that a complete twelve- (12) month probationary period be served in that department. If a regular employee or an employee who is still serving a trial service period is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with the approval of the Personnel Director, require that a twelve- (12) month trial service period be served in that department.

 17.5.1 If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve- (12) month probationary period in the new classification. If a regular employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve- (12) month trial service period in the new classification.

 17.5.2 Within the same department, if a regular employee is appointed to a higher classification while serving in a trial service period, the trial service period for the lower classification and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided that the higher and lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field. The employee shall complete the term of the original trial service period and be given regular status in the lower classification. Such employee shall also be granted the rights normally accruing to trial service for the remainder of the trial service period in the higher classification.

 17.5.3 Within the same department, if a probationary employee is regularly appointed to a higher classification while serving in a probationary period, the probationary period and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided the higher and the lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field. The employee shall complete the term of the original probationary period and be given regular standing in the lower class.

 ARTICLE 18 -- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

 18.1 Eight (8) hours within nine (9) consecutive hours shall constitute a work day and five (5) consecutive days shall constitute a work week of forty (40) hours. Work schedules shall normally consist of five consecutive days followed by two consecutive days off, except for relief shift assignments, 4/10 work schedules, and other special schedules.

 18.1.1 Breaks and Meal Periods -- During a normal work shift of up to twelve (12) hours, an employee will be allowed one fifteen (15) minute paid break in each half of the shift. Employees shall be allowed a one half- (1/2) hour unpaid meal period which shall commence no less than two (2) hours nor more than five (5) hours from the beginning of a regular shift. For a regular shift of ten (10) to twelve (12) hours, the meal period may commence up to six (6) hours into the shift. If an employee is required to work through the scheduled meal period and there is inability to reschedule the meal period during the shift, all hours worked shall be compensated.

 During overtime hours, employees will be allowed an unpaid one-half- (1/2)hour meal period, as the work will allow as determined by the supervisor, within the first three (3) hours of the overtime. Should the employees be required by the City to remain at the work site to consume a meal, the meal period shall be paid for the same as the overtime hours. Meal periods of one-half- (1/2)hour shall continue to be provided within each successive four (4) hours of overtime.

 Employees who are required to work a second shift after completion of their regular shift shall be allowed breaks and meal periods as normally scheduled for the shift. As an alternative, the employee may, within the first two (2) hours of the second shift, request and be granted one-half- (1/2) hour meal period in lieu of the first break. If the request is granted, the employee will then be allowed only one (1) other break later in the shift.

 Employees who are scheduled to work an overtime shift on a normal day off shall be allowed breaks and a meal period as allowed for a regular shift.

 18.1.2 Where work conditions require continuous staffing throughout a work shift for thirty (30) consecutive days or more, the City may, in lieu of the meal period and rest periods provided in Sections 18.1.1, provide a working meal period and working rest periods during working hours without a loss in pay so that such periods do not interfere with ongoing work requirements.

 18.1.3 When management deems it necessary, work schedules may be established other than the normal Monday through Friday schedule; provided, however, that where work weeks other than the basic departmental work week schedules in force on the effective date of this Agreement are deemed necessary, the change(s) and reason therefore shall be provided to the Union. Two (2) days' advance notice shall be afforded the Union and employees covered by this Agreement when shift changes are required by their supervisor.

 18.1.4 All work performed in excess of eight (8) hours in any work day or forty (40) hours in any work week shall be considered as overtime. Such overtime work shall be paid for at the rate of two (2) times the employee's regular straight time rate of pay or by mutual consent between the employee and his/her supervisor in compensatory time off at the applicable overtime rate.

 A "work week" for purposes of determining whether an employee exceeds forty (40) hours in a work week shall be a seven (7) consecutive day period of time beginning on Wednesday and ending on Tuesday, except when expressly designated to begin and end on different days and times from the normal Wednesday through Tuesday work week.

 Notwithstanding the other Sections of this Article, the City may, following consultation and agreement with the Union involved, implement a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week within its various departments. In administering the four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week, overtime shall be paid for any hours worked in excess of ten (10) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week subject to the terms and conditions as expressed in this Article.

 18.1.4.1 For employees who work a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week or other alternative work schedule, the following shall apply:

 If a holiday is observed on a Saturday or on a Friday that is the normal day off, the holiday will be taken on the last normal workday. If a holiday is observed on a Monday that is the normal day off or on a Sunday, the holiday will be taken on the next normal workday. This schedule will be followed unless the employee and his/her supervisor determine that some other day will be taken off for the holiday; provided, however, that in such case the holiday time must be used no later than the end of the following pay period. If the holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday that is the employee's normal scheduled day off, the holiday must be scheduled off no later than the end of the following pay period.

 18.1.5 Crew Chiefs Unit -- Administrative overtime shall be defined as overtime for completion or reading of paperwork, attendance at meetings or discussions concerning administrative matters such as time sheets, performance appraisals, sick leave forms or budget matters as opposed to matters related to a specific water operations project. Administrative overtime shall be paid for at the rate of one and one- half times the straight-time rate of pay.

 18.1.5.1 Crew Chiefs Unit -- Field duties and emergency response overtime shall be defined as hours worked, whether before or after a shift or on a call-out basis, involving field duties related to Seattle Public Utilities or other City department operations projects, meetings required to discuss these projects and/or emergency response field duties. Field duty and emergency response overtime shall be paid for at the rate of double the straight-time rate of pay.

 18.1.6 Emergency Call Back -- Employees who are called back to work after completing their regular shift and who are relieved of duty before commencing their next regular shift shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours' straight-time pay for all time worked up to two (2) hours. Any time worked in excess of two (2) hours shall be paid for at double the straight-time rate of pay for actual hours worked.

 Example:

 Zero (0) minutes to two (2) hours = 4 hours' straight-time pay. Two and one-half (2 1/2) hours = 5 hours' straight-time pay. Four (4) hours = 8 hours' straight-time pay.

 18.1.7 Employees who are called back to work or remain at work on a shift extension on an overtime basis and meet all of the following conditions will receive a compensatory time benefit as described herein:

 Conditions:

 A. The employee is required to work in excess of eight (8) hours on an overtime basis;

 B. The employee's next regularly scheduled shift begins within eight (8) hours of being released from overtime; and

 C. The employee must have worked a total of sixteen (16) hours within the twenty-four- (24) hour period commencing at the beginning of his/her preceding regular shift.

 Compensatory Time Benefit:

 In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary to work an employee over sixteen (16) hours and in that event for each overtime hour worked in excess of eight (8) overtime hours, under the conditions described above, the employee shall accrue one (1) hour of compensatory time, which must be used at the beginning of or during the employee's next regular shift that commences within eight (8) hours of being released from the overtime work.

 At the employee's option such compensatory time may be supplemented with accrued vacation hours or leave without pay or, if deemed necessary by the Operations Manager of the Seattle Public Utilities, or the designated manager in other City departments, or his/her designee, the employee may be required to return to work.

 Such compensatory time shall be earned in addition to the normal overtime rate of pay.

 18.1.8 In extended emergency situations, without prior notice, the Utility will switch to two (2) twelve (12) hour shifts until the emergency is resolved. Seattle Public Utilities and the Union agree to participate in joint labor-management meetings to discuss the terms and conditions of switching to two twelve hour shifts.

 18.1.9 Meal Reimbursement -- Full time employees shall be eligible for a meal reimbursement benefit when directed to work two or more hours of unscheduled overtime, or ten or more hours of overtime on a scheduled basis. For the purposes of meal reimbursement only, scheduled overtime is any period of overtime work where the date, start time and stop time are communicated to the affected employee 12 or more hours in advance of the scheduled start time, and where such a notified employee has had at least 8 hours off work, prior to the start of the scheduled overtime.

 A. Unscheduled Overtime -- After a full time employee has worked two hours of unscheduled overtime, he or she shall be eligible for a meal reimbursement benefit. After this two-hour requirement has been satisfied, he or she shall be eligible for one additional meal reimbursement benefit for each additional five-hour period of unscheduled overtime worked. Such benefits apply without regard to whether or not the overtime is worked adjacent to a scheduled shift.

 B. Scheduled Overtime -- After a full time employee has worked ten hours of overtime, resulting from a scheduled overtime assignment, he or she shall be eligible for a meal reimbursement benefit. After this 10-hour requirement has been satisfied, he or she shall be eligible for one additional meal reimbursement benefit for each additional five-hour period of overtime worked. Such benefits apply without regard to whether or not the overtime is worked adjacent to a scheduled shift.

 C. Extension of Scheduled Overtime -- If a period of scheduled overtime is planned to last for eight hours or less, no meal reimbursement eligibility shall exist for that scheduled overtime period because fewer than ten hours of overtime had been scheduled. However, if an eight-hour or shorter scheduled overtime period must later be extended two or more hours past its scheduled stop time, then any additional overtime hours, by themselves, shall be treated as unscheduled overtime as provided for in A above.

 Reimbursement shall be made for cost, up to a maximum of $12.00, if a dated, itemized, original receipt from the establishment is provided by the employee. The receipt must indicate that the meal was purchased no more than two hours before or two hours after the qualifying period of overtime. The City shall not reimburse the cost of alcoholic beverages and gratuities. An employee may, at his or her discretion, apply for a $10.00 meal allowance in lieu of the meal reimbursement benefit. Submission of receipts will not be required for meal allowance applications. An employee qualifying for a meal reimbursement benefit must submit either an application for meal reimbursement, or an application for meal allowance, no later than the close of the business day following the day the meal was purchased. Absent such an application, no reimbursement or allowance will be paid.

 A department may, at its discretion, provide or engage another agency to provide one or all of the meals for which the meal reimbursement or allowance benefit would otherwise apply. Employees shall not be eligible for meal reimbursement or allowance for meals so provided.

 18.2 Meal Reimbursement while on Travel Status An employee shall be reimbursed for meals while on travel status at the federal per diem rate. An employee will not be required to submit receipts for meals and may retain any unspent portion of an advance cash allowance for meals.

 18.3 Standby Duty (Applicable in all departments and to all bargaining unit employees) -- Whenever an employee is placed on voluntary Standby Duty, that employee shall be available at a predetermined location or by pager Standby, at the employee's option, to respond to emergency calls and, when necessary, return immediately to work. An employee on Standby Duty shall be paid at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay. When an employee is required to return to work while on Standby Duty, the Standby Duty pay shall be discontinued for actual hours worked and compensation shall be provided in accordance with Section 18.1.6.

 18.4 Seattle Public Utilities' Standby Procedure -- Voluntary Standby Rosters will be posted for the Water Operations Division and Watersheds and Transmission Divisions. Senior Workers, Workers and Apprentices in the Operations Division and Senior Workers in the Watersheds and Transmission Divisions may indicate their willingness to be placed on the Standby Roster by advising the Supervisor charged with maintaining the Standby Roster in writing of their willingness for Standby Duty. An employee shall have his/her name removed from the Standby Roster upon written notification to the Supervisor one week (seven calendar days) prior to his/her scheduled date to commence Standby Duty. An employee may have his/her name withdrawn on short notice, less than seven (7) days, if a volunteer is substituted in his/her place within the same classification. Assignment for Standby Duty from the Standby Roster will be rotated on a weekly basis. It is the responsibility of the employee to be aware of his/her position on the Roster and to be prepared for rotation to Standby Duty (see clarification below).

 18.4.1 If the Standby Roster sign-up procedure described in Section 18.3 does not produce sufficient personnel by noon on Monday of a given week to field a Standby crew consisting of one (1) Crew Chief, one (1) Senior Water Pipe Worker, and one (1) Water Pipe Worker/Apprentice in Operations Division, and one (1) Crew Chief or Senior Worker in the Watershed and Transmission Divisions for the ensuing seven (7) day standby period commencing Friday evening, the Seattle Public Utilities will immediately notify the Shop Steward or Business Agent of such fact. If the Union cannot provide sufficient, additional individuals for Standby Duty commencing that Friday evening by noon Friday, the Seattle Public Utilities may designate additional personnel to provide equivalent coverage. Designation may be rotated, starting with the least senior employee within each appropriate class, from a list of all affected employees. (Apprentices are not eligible for at least six (6) months and until determined as qualified.) Seniority is determined by service in the job title; total City service (earned-to-date hours) will break a tie in seniority.

 18.4.2 Personnel on Standby are expected to call within fifteen (15) minutes after being paged. When an employee is required to return to work while on standby duty, the standby pay shall be discontinued for the actual hours on work duty and compensation shall be provided for actual hours worked and in accordance with 18.1.6.

 Crew personnel on pager Standby will be allowed to take a City vehicle home or be paid mileage for the use of their private vehicle, at the City's option. Crew Chiefs, when on Standby, will be allowed to take their City vehicle home. If an employee is assigned a City vehicle to take home, overtime pay will start from the time the employee is contacted.

 18.4.3 If personnel who volunteer and are assigned Standby Duty require additional training, such training, travel, and travel time shall be at Seattle Public Utilities' expense if required on off-duty time. No employee shall be required to report to other than his normal duty station to commence his/her work day for purposes of such training.

 18.4.4 Nothing herein shall be construed to guarantee a minimum staffing level for Standby Duty nor is a maximum level to be implied.

 18.4.5 Seattle Public Utilities and the Union agree to participate in joint labor-management meetings to discuss the terms and conditions of Seattle Public Utilities' standby procedures. Upon mutual agreement, the procedures may be revised and implemented during the life of this agreement.

 18.5 Before instituting a standby procedure applicable to any bargaining unit title in any City department, the department shall notify the Union of the procedure and shall provide the Union no less than fifteen (15) calendar days for comments or for proposing an alternative procedure. Failing agreement on an alternative procedure within thirty (30) days from the date a procedure was originally proposed, the department may implement its originally proposed procedure or a modification thereof. With any procedure, if sufficient volunteers are not available to staff a standby procedure, all employees working at an affected facility, geographical area, or in the work unit may be assigned on a rotating basis, starting with the least senior employee in the affected job title(s). Seniority is determined by service in the job title(s); alphabetical order of last names shall break a tie in seniority.

 A department may continue an existing standby procedure and assignment rotation unless a different arrangement is agreed upon. Before the department institutes a change in the standby procedure, the Union shall be notified and shall be provided no less than fifteen (15) calendar days for comments or to propose an alternative procedure. Failing agreement on an alternative procedure within thirty (30) days from the date procedure modifications were originally proposed, the department may implement its originally proposed modifications or an alternative modification. With any procedure, if sufficient volunteers are not available to staff a standby procedure, all employees working at an affected facility, geographical area, or in the work unit may be assigned on a rotating basis, starting with the least senior employee in the affected job title(s). Seniority is determined by service in the job title(s); alphabetical order of last names shall break a tie in seniority.

 18.6 Employees in the Water Operations and Water Quality units of the Seattle Public Utilities who are scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of a regular work shift during the evening (swing) or night (graveyard) shift, shall receive one of the following premiums for all scheduled hours worked during such shift.

 Swing Shift $.35 hour Graveyard Shift $.45 hour

 The above shift premium shall apply to time worked as opposed to time- off with pay; and therefore, for example, the premium shall not apply to sick leave, vacation, holiday pay, funeral leave, or other paid leave benefit.

 Overtime shall be computed from the employee's base pay and shall not include the shift premium pay. However, an employee assigned to work one of these shifts on an overtime basis shall be paid the premium pay in addition to the overtime pay if actual overtime work continues for four (4) hours or more.

 In no event shall shift premium pay be due employees who work overtime as an extension of their regular shift or on a call-out basis if not being assigned to work in one of the positions normally scheduled for swing or graveyard shift.

 A. Interim appointees

 B. Temporary or intermittent employees not earning service credit.

 C. Probationary employees*

 D. Trial service employees* (who cannot be reverted in accordance with Section 17.4.2.)

 A. Upon showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of the department require a special experience, training, or skill.

 B. When (1) women or minorities are substantially underrepresented in an "EEO" category within a department; or (2) a planned layoff would produce substantial underrepresentation of women or minorities; and (3) such layoff in normal order would have a negative, disparate impact on women or minorities; then the Personnel Director shall make

Otherwise, this section shall only be applicable to those positions that are covered by this Agreement.

 19.4.4 Nothing in this Article shall prevent the reinstatement of any regular, trial service, or probationary employee for the purpose of appointment to another lateral title or for voluntary reduction in class as provided in this Article.

 19.5 For purposes of layoff, service credit in a class for a regular employee shall be computed to cover all service subsequent to their regular appointment to a position in that class and shall be applicable in the department in which employed and specifically as follows:

This Agreement shall not limit the right of the City to contract for services of any and all types.

 ARTICLE 23 -- PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE

 23.1 Delivery of municipal services in the most efficient, effective and courteous manner is of paramount importance to the City; and, as such, maximized productivity is recognized to be an obligation of employees covered by this Agreement. In order to achieve this goal, the parties hereby recognize the City's right to determine the methods, processes, and means of providing municipal service; the rights to increase or diminish operations, in whole or in part; the right to increase, diminish or change municipal equipment, including the introduction of any and all new, improved, or automated methods or equipment; the assignment of employees to specific jobs, the determination of job content and/or job duties, and the combination or consolidation of jobs; provided, however, the exercise of such rights contained herein shall not modify or change any provision of this Agreement without the written concurrence of the Union and the City.

 23.2 The Union recognizes the City's right to establish and/or revise performance standards. Such standards may be used to determine acceptable performance levels, prepare work schedules, and to measure the performance of each employee or groups of employees. In establishing new and/or revising existing performance standards, the City shall meet, prior to implementation, with the labor-management committee to jointly discuss such performance standards. The City agrees that performance standards shall be reasonable.

 23.3 Employment Security -- Labor and management support continuing efforts to provide the best service delivery and the highest quality service in the most cost-effective manner to the citizens of Seattle. Critical to achieving this purpose is the involvement of employees in sharing information and creatively addressing workplace issues, including administrative and service delivery productivity, efficiency, quality control, and customer service.

 Labor and management agree, that in order to maximize participation and results from the Employee Involvement Committees ("EICs"), no one will lose employment or equivalent rate of pay with the City of Seattle because of efficiencies resulting from an EIC initiative.

 Coordinated Bargaining

 TENTATIVE AGREEMENT Between the City of Seattle And The Coalition of City Unions May 25, 2005

 A. WAGES

 1. Effective December 29, 2004, wages will be increased 2.5%.

 2. Effective December 28, 2005, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2003 through June 2004 to the period August 2004 through June 2005.

 3. Effective December 27, 2006, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2004 through June 2005 to the period August 2005 through June 2006.

 4. For 2006 and 2007, the percentage increases shall be at least two percent (2%) and not more than seven percent (7%).

 B. HEALTH CARE

 1. For the 2005 contract term, employee premium sharing and the status of the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be maintained as determined by the Health Care Committee at the last meeting of the Committee in September, 2004. In addition, The City will pay the equivalent of $1 million, annualized, for enhanced benefits implemented in 2005, which shall become a part of the "base" for the future City's cost obligations. The specific benefit enhancements will be determined by HC2. Further, the parties agree that eleven thousand dollars ($11,000) shall be utilized from the "Special" Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) for the purpose of paying Aon Consulting to complete an analysis of the City's self-insured claims experience to identify potential Wellness and Disease Management Programs that would be best targeted to address the City's claims experience. Also, the parties commit to support Wellness and Disease Management Programs identified as a result of the Aon study for implementation in 2006, utilizing "Special" RSF through the Health Care Committee processes.

 2. The parties agree to amend for the 2006 and 2007 contract years the Memorandum of Agreement previously established by the parties to govern the Joint Labor-Management Health Care Committee process (which shall be attached hereto as Exhibit I and by reference is incorporated herein) as follows:

 a) The City shall pay up to one hundred seven percent (107%) of the City's previous year's costs to the extent required to cover increases in the total health care costs for a given program year (e.g. 2006 or 2007);

 b) The RSF shall be utilized for any given program year until it is exhausted to cover costs in excess of the City's obligation identified in 1, above;

 c) After the RSF has been exhausted, additional costs shall be shared by the City paying eighty-five percent (85%) of the excess costs and employees paying fifteen percent (15%) of the excess costs;

 d) Intent: Plan designs are to be maintained during this Contract, not to be diminished. The respective health care plan benefit designs may only be modified by the Health Care Committee for either contract year by the written, mutual agreement of the parties (Coalition of City Unions and the City);

 e) Intent: Should the parties agree to reduce premium costs, the reduction would apply to City as well as employee premiums. Use of resources from the RSF during either contract year to reduce projected increase in health care costs that exceed the resources provided through 1, above, shall be authorized only if applied to the total, annual premiums of the respective health care plan(s); and

 f) No decision by the Health Care Committee shall be permitted that modifies the established percentages established in c), above.

 C. VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACCOUNT (VEBA)

 1. Beginning in the 2006 year of the agreement, any ratified collective bargaining agreement that contractually requires the placement of all employee sick leave cash-out resources at retirement into a VEBA account for use by the respective employee for post- retirement health care costs as allowed under the IRS regulations associated with such accounts will include an increase in the cash-out value of sick leave at retirement from twenty-five percent (25%) to thirty-five percent (35%).

 2. In addition to the cash-out of sick leave at retirement as provided herein, on an annual basis during the month of January, commencing in January of 2006, any active employee who would have a sick leave balance of at least 240 hours following the cash-out of accrued sick leave as described as follows may, by execution of the appropriate payroll authorization, cash out up to fifty percent (50%) of the unused sick leave allocation said employee accrued during the prior fiscal year at the cash-out value of thirty-five percent (35%) for placement in said employee's VEBA account in accordance with and for the uses as provided by applicable IRS regulations associated with such accounts. For example, if a given employee had a sick leave balance of 288 hours on January 1, 2006, and said employee used two days of sick leave from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2005, said employee could, by execution of the appropriate payroll authorization, cash out up to 40 hours of sick leave at a cash-out value of 35% for placement in the employee's VEBA account.

 D. SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLANS

 The City agrees to assess, on the basis of a specific proposal made by a Coalition Union either as part of the Coalition coordinated bargaining process or as part of the individual contract negotiations with a given Union, the acceptability to the City of a given supplemental pension proposal as a policy matter and respond promptly to the Union making such a proposal whether, and/or under what conditions, such a proposal would be acceptable.

 E. SICK LEAVE

 The definition of "Eligible family member" contained in SMC 4.24.005 shall be amended by the elimination of the existing phrase "who is (a) under eighteen (18) years of age; or (b) eighteen (18) years of age or older and incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability" and the addition of the word "sibling."

 The expressed purpose for the proposed modification of said definition shall be to allow an employee to use sick leave because of an illness, injury, or health care appointment of an employee's sibling or adult child, or the sibling or adult child of an employee's spouse or domestic partner, in instances where the absence of the employee from work is required, or when such absence is recommended by a health care provider.

 F. PAY FOR DEPLOYED MILITARY

 All collective bargaining agreements established as a part of these negotiations shall be amended to include the following language:

 "A bargaining unit member in the Reserves, National Guard, or Air National Guard who is deployed on extended unpaid military leave of absence and whose military pay (plus adjustments) is less than ninety percent (90%) of their base pay as a City employee shall receive the difference between ninety percent (90%) of their City base pay and their military pay (plus adjustments).

 City base pay shall include every part of wages except overtime.

 G. PERSONAL HOLIDAYS

 If the 2005 year-end actuarial study commissioned by the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System (hereinafter, "System") reports that the amortization period for the System's unfunded actuarial liability does not exceed thirty (30) years and, therefore, no increase in the City's contribution level is required, the parties to this tentative agreement shall, upon the written request to the City by the Unions that are a party to this agreement, enter into negotiations solely and exclusively with respect to the issue of whether and/or to what extent and/or in what manner the number of Personal Holidays available to employees shall be increased.

 H. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS

 The following shall be incorporated into each collective bargaining agreement that is the result of the coordinated bargaining process with the Coalition of City Unions:

 For All Coalition Unions Covered by a Corresponding Provision as Part of the 2001 Coalition Bargaining Process; and for Teamsters, Local 117, Evidence Warehouser/CSO's; and for WSCCCE, Local 21-P (PEO's)

 The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspective(s) as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective August 18, 2004, employees who participate in bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

 1. Bargaining preparation and meetings of the Union's bargaining team other than actual negotiations shall not be applicable to this provision;

 2. No more than an aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision.

 3. If the aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours is exceeded, the Union shall reimburse the City for the cost of said employee(s) time, including any associated overtime costs.

 For Joint Crafts Council

 The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspective(s) as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective August 18, 2004, employees who participate in bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

 1. Bargaining preparation and meetings of the Union's bargaining team other than actual negotiations shall not be applicable to this provision;

 2. No more than an aggregate of one hundred (100) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision for both Coordinated Bargaining with the Coalition of City Unions and bargaining on the Joint Crafts Council "boilerplate" language.

 3. In addition to the above, no more than an aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision for bargaining on the Joint Crafts Council Appendices.

 4. If the aggregate of one hundred (150) hours is exceeded, the Union shall reimburse the City for the cost of said employee(s) time, including any associated overtime costs.
