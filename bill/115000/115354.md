 EXHIBIT C to Vending Concession Agreement

 VENDING CONCESSION AGREEMENT

 Between

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 and

 SUMMIT VENDING, INC.

 This Vending Concession Agreement ("Agreement") is made between the City of Seattle ("City"), a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, operating through its Department of Parks and Recreation ("Department") and its Superintendent of Parks and Recreation ("Superintendent"), and Summit Vending, Inc. ("Concessionaire"), a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Washington.

 WHEREAS, the City, operating through its Department, owns and operates various public park facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Department desires to have consistent vending services provided for citizens and guests using these facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Department desires to offer healthy food and beverage selections in modern energy efficient vending machines on City property; and

 WHEREAS, the Department advertised in the City's newspaper of record, "Daily Journal of Commerce", and solicited proposals for vending services from qualified individuals and firms; and

 WHEREAS, the Concessionaire submitted proposals for vending services, and the Department's evaluation panel selected the Concessionaire's proposals as most advantageous to the Department, the Superintendent concurring.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 I. GRANT.

 The City grants to the Concessionaire the non-exclusive right to offer vending as specified in this Agreement on the properties that are listed in Exhibit A to this Agreement ("Park Properties").

 II. TERM AND EARLY TERMINATION.

 This Agreement shall commence on June 30, 2005, and shall expire at 11:59 pm on May 31, 2010, unless extended or sooner terminated as provided in this Agreement. This Agreement may be extended for an additional five (5) year term at the option of the Superintendent.

 This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time for any or no reason by giving sixty (60) days written notice to the other party.

 III. CONCESSIONAIRE RESPONSIBILITIES.

 A. PERFORMANCE DEPOSIT.

 The Concessionaire shall maintain a performance bond in the amount of $20,000.00 (Twenty thousand dollars) on a form approved by the Department or shall make a $20,000.00 (Twenty thousand dollars) cash deposit with the Department. The Concessionaire shall pay a cash deposit only with a cashier's check. The deposit or bond shall remain in effect throughout the term of this contract and for three (3) months thereafter unless the Department notifies the Concessionaire in writing that this requirement has been eliminated. The bond or deposit will not be released by the Department until the Concessionaire has satisfactorily discharged all duties, responsibilities and performances under the Agreement.

 Should the Concessionaire fail to fulfill its obligations contained in this Agreement, then the Department may, in addition to all other rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement and under the laws of the State of Washington, retain the Concessionaire's performance deposit or obtain payment on the bond. The retention of the deposit or payment on the bond does not limit the Concessionaire's financial responsibility for default nor does the retention of the deposit or payment on the bond limit the Department's right of recovery against the Concessionaire.

 B. MENU OFFERINGS.

 The Concessionaire shall at all times stock all vending machines with health conscious beverage and food selections as follows: two out of every three beverage selections in each vending machine and two out of every three food selections in each vending machine must at all times meet the following criteria:

 Healthy snacks will have:

 Fat - No more than 30% (Thirty percent) of total calories from fat.

 Saturated Fat - No more than 10% (Ten percent) of the calories from saturated fat.

 Sugar - No more than 35% (Thirty five percent) by weight; except for fresh, dried or canned fruits and vegetables.

 Healthy beverages will have:

 Juices - At least 50% (Fifty percent) fruit juice with no added sweeteners.

 Milk - Low fat or non-fat milk.

 Sports Drinks - no more than 42 (Forty two) grams of sugar per 20 (Twenty) ounce bottle.

 Furthermore, all selections (three out of every three selections) must appear on the lists in Exhibit B (approved beverages) or on the lists in Exhibit C (approved food).

 C. TYPE, NUMBER, LOCATION, AND INSTALLATION OF VENDING MACHINES

 At its own expense, the Concessionaire shall install vending machines on the Park Properties of the type described in Exhibits B and C; and of the number listed in Exhibit A at each Park Property. The exact location of all vending machines on the Park Properties shall be determined or approved in advance by the Superintendent. The Superintendent, at his sole discretion, may change the exact location of any or all vending machines on the Park Properties. The parties may change the required number of machines at each Park Property by mutual agreement. The Department may request a different type of machine per Section III.M. of this Agreement.

 D. NO STORAGE ON THE PROPERTIES.

 The Concessionaire shall be responsible for storage of any supplies, inactive machines, equipment, vehicles, etc. The Department shall provide no storage space.

 E. AGE OF VENDING MACHINES.

 All machines will be of recent manufacture. The Department reserves the right to require the replacement of any vending machine that is deemed, in the opinion of the Department, unsuitable and/or unreliable within 30 days of such determination.

 F. ENERGY EFFICIENT.

 The cold beverage vending machines provided by the Concessionaire shall be Energy Star compliant and/or be equipped with Vending Misers or other conservation technology that is acceptable to the Department.

 "Energy Star" shall mean that government-backed program that helps businesses and individuals protect the environment through superior energy efficiency. Energy Star compliant products meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA and US Department of Energy.

 "Vending Miser" shall mean a technology which significantly reduces energy consumption without compromising the vended product. Utilizing a custom passive infrared sensor, Vending Miser powers down a vending machine when the area surrounding it is unoccupied and automatically repowers the vending machine when the area is reoccupied. Vending Miser's intelligent controller operates by learning from the habits of the building occupants, and modifies the time-out period accordingly. Additionally, Vending Miser monitors the ambient temperature while the vending machine is powered down. Using this information, Vending Miser automatically powers up the vending machine at appropriate intervals, independent of occupancy, to ensure that the vended product stays cold. Vending Miser also monitors electrical current used by the vending machine. This ensures that Vending Miser will never power down a vending machine while the compressor is running, so a high head pressure start never occurs. In addition, the current sensor also ensures that every time the vending machine is powered up, the cooling cycle is run to completion before again powering down the vending machine. This unique process also ensures a cold vended product.

 Concessionaire at its sole expense shall be responsible for cleaning and maintaining (including repairing and otherwise servicing) all machines. Concessionaire will maintain and clean its vending machines at least every other week and more frequently if required by the Department.

The proration shall be determined in any reasonable manner by the Department.

 M. NEW TECHNOLOGY.
