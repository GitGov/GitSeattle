 Neighborhood District: Central Neighborhood Plan: Not in Plan

 This project completes the acquisition of two residential properties in the Madison Valley neighborhood that have experienced multiple flooding and sewer backups since the 1970s. Acquisition of these properties is expected to reduce future inconvenience and potential health problems due to flooding or wastewater backups, as well as payments by SPU's Wastewater and Drainage Fund of related claims. Ownership of these properties may also provide some flexibility to SPU as it assesses and develops a remedy to the drainage, flooding and wastewater backup problems in this area.
