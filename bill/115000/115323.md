 Section 6. The description of the Sediment Remediation - Drainage Project #C3NW033-011 in the 2005-2010 Adopted CIP for SPU - Drainage and Wastewater is amended as follows:

 This project provides drainage funding for preliminary studies and analysis for cleanup of contaminated sediment sites in which the City is a participant, for actual clean-up of contaminated sites, and for preliminary engineering for future clean-up efforts. Funding is used to develop studies and analyses required by regulatory agencies for determining the boundaries and clean up requirements for specific action sites.
