 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to real property known as Discovery Park and the laying off of portions of the park roadways within Discovery Park known as Utah Street, Washington Avenue, California Avenue, Iowa Street, Lawtonwood Road, Illinois Avenue, Texas Way, Bay Terrace Road, Idaho Avenue and 45th Avenue West, as public park boulevards; amending Appendices I and II to Ordinance 117569 and to Title 15 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Description and Maps of Park Drives and Boulevards); and naming the portions of Washington Avenue and Utah Street so laid off as Discovery Park Boulevard.

 WHEREAS, owners of private properties abutting several of the rights of way in Discovery Park require access across the rights of way for utility purposes or ingress and egress to adjacent private properties; and

 WHEREAS, the rights of private property owners will be preserved if the street rights of way are characterized as Park Boulevards; and

 WHEREAS, designation as a Park Boulevard provides for uses for transportation and utility purposes; and

 WHEREAS, public safety will be enhanced within Discovery Park as traffic codes and regulations are fully enforceable on Park Boulevards as they are on City of Seattle streets, but not necessarily on park roads which are considered "private"; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed designation will cause the newly designated boulevards to be part of the joint maintenance responsibilities (to the extent required) by the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR"), Seattle Department of Transportation, and Seattle Public Utilities; and

 WHEREAS, Park Boulevards are under the jurisdiction of DPR and thus are consistent with covenants made with the grantors of the property, the United States, requiring that the lands of Discovery Park be maintained in perpetuity for park purposes;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The portions of the park roadways known as Utah Street, Washington Avenue, California Avenue, Iowa Street, Lawtonwood Road, Illinois Avenue, Texas Way, Bay Terrace Road, Idaho Avenue and 45th Avenue West (the ""Designated Portions"), described as follows are hereby designated as Park Boulevards, as defined in SMC 15.02.046 and RCW 35.21.190:
