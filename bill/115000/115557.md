 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2006 Budget; carrying forward certain unexpended appropriations and funds for both capital and non-capital purposes from the 2005 budget of various departments; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.32A.080 provides that unexpended and unencumbered appropriations for capital purposes automatically carry forward from each budget year to the next unless abandoned by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, appropriations for the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP) are readily identifiable as being capital in nature and therefore automatically carry forward without Council action; and

 WHEREAS, the City appropriates funds for capital purposes that are not readily identifiable as capital appropriations because they are not tied to a CIP project; and

 WHEREAS, it was, and is, the Executive's and City Council's intent that those capital appropriations are carried forward in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080; and

 WHEREAS, certain City departments and agencies have unexpended 2005 non-capital appropriations that the Executive and City Council wish to carry forward into 2006, but which were not included in the 2006 Adopted Budget; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Capital Carry Forward. The Department of Finance shall certify to the Chair of the City Council Finance and Budget Committee a list of those unexpended appropriations in the 2005 budget which were for capital purposes but were not for the Capital Improvement Program. The Chair shall file the certification with the City Clerk. Those appropriations are automatically carried forward to the 2006 budget for the same capital purposes for which they were intended, and in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080.

 Section 2. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred in 2006, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriations for the following in the 2006 budget are increased from the fund shown, as follows:
