 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the South Downtown Planning Project; reducing and reappropriating with a limitation a portion of an appropriation in the 2005 budget of the Department of Planning and Development; and authorizing acceptance of donations from public and private sources for that project.

 WHEREAS, South Downtown is an area comprised of diverse neighborhoods and development patterns and is a key southern anchor to Seattle's Center City; and

 WHEREAS, South Downtown is anticipated to play a substantial role in meeting the growth management objectives of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan and Downtown neighborhood plans by providing new housing and job growth; and

 WHEREAS, because neighborhoods comprising South Downtown have not consistently met expectations with regard to housing and rehabilitation of vacant structures, the City has initiated the South Downtown Planning Project; and

 WHEREAS, the South Downtown Planning Project will: identify impediments to positive growth and development patterns; evaluate whether the area's growth expectations remain relevant; and evaluate the influence of City regulations and policies on the development of housing and jobs in the area; and

 WHEREAS, South Downtown stakeholders have expressed interest in donating funding, totaling up to approximately $200,000 in 2005 and an additional $93,000 in 2006, to assist in performing necessary elements of the South Downtown Planning Project, including an economic analysis of development trends and sensitivities; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council stipulated in a proviso to the 2005 Budget that "None of the money appropriated for 2005 for the Department of Planning and Development Planning BCL can be spent for the South Downtown Study until authorized by future ordinance;" and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) has appointed a twenty-five member Advisory Group that represents diverse interests in the South Downtown area; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development has provided Working Rules to the South Downtown Advisory Group that clarify the role of the Group and state that staff will provide information at the request of the group as a whole, rather than sharing such information with individual members; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development has stated that it will use funds from private stakeholders only after an initial land use analysis and preliminary recommendations have been developed based on information and comments from the Advisory Committee and general public; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that the steps listed above will help ensure that contributors of funding will not exercise undue influence over the South Downtown Planning Project's conduct, direction, or outcome, and expects DPD to sustain these actions; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to accept funding from stakeholders to complete specified portions of the South Downtown Planning Project;
