 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light (hereafter "City Light") acquired the Gatewood substation property (hereafter "Substation Property") for electric utility purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the substation has become obsolete and the Substation Property is no longer useful to City Light; and

 WHEREAS, the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy Program, proposed under Ordinance 121230, was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy Program provides for the acquisition of land for the relocation of and construction of a new Fire Station No. 37; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121380 authorized the Fleets and Facilities Department to negotiate for the acquisition of real property as necessary to carry out all elements of the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy Program, and appropriated funds therefore, with such funds to be supplemented by certain funds appropriated under Ordinance 121333; and

 WHEREAS, the Fleets and Facilities Department has determined that the Substation Property legally described below is suitable for the relocation of Fire Station No. 37 and that it is in the public interest to acquire the same for the purposes enumerated above; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent of City Light and the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department have agreed to transfer jurisdiction of the Substation Property from City Light to the Fleets and Facilities Department, subject to certain conditions; and

 WHEREAS, City Light and the Fleets and Facilities Department have determined the fair market value of the Substation Property by real estate appraisal, which assumes that there are no environmentally hazardous substances in or on the Substation Property that would affect its value; and

 WHEREAS, City Light and the Fleets and Facilities Department have agreed to cooperate in the performance of an environmental assessment of the Substation Property and to mutually determine the most effective and least costly method of completing any necessary clean-up of any environmentally hazardous substances and remediation work in order that design and construction may proceed on schedule; NOW THEREFORE,

 is transferred from Seattle City Light to the Fleets and Facilities Department for general municipal purposes, including but not limited to the relocation of Fire Station No. 37.
