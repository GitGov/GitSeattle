 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the South Lake Union Park Development Project; amending the 2006 Adopted Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation by making a new appropriation and transferring appropriations; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Seattle citizens have envisioned the creation of an accessible waterfront park at the south end of Lake Union ever since the Olmsted Park Plan was developed more than one hundred years ago; and

 WHEREAS, the 1998 South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan emphasized the development of the South Lake Union Park as a top priority; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30080 authorized the property disposition process that led to the sale of City of Seattle (City) property in South Lake Union and set forth a number of policy objectives which continue to guide the City's actions; and

 WHEREAS, the 2000 Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy (hereafter 2000 Parks Levy) identified funding for the development of the South Lake Union Park; and

 WHEREAS, the voters of Seattle approved the 2000 Parks Levy on November 7, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, construction of South Lake Union (SLU) Park will be undertaken in phases as funds become available and the City intends to continue its efforts to secure the necessary funding from various sources to fully implement all elements of the park plan; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121963 authorized the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement between the Seattle Parks Foundation (Foundation) and the City of Seattle, delineating each party's roles and responsibilities relative to the design, development, and construction of SLU Park; and

 WHEREAS, the current budget for Phase I of the SLU Park Development Project resulted in designs of the bulkhead at the Park that reduced the overall park land by approximately 8,000 square feet, eliminated the ability to moor large ships along the bulkhead, reduced the size of the bulkhead and boardwalk along the west side, and significantly limited the life expectancy of the bulkhead; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks Foundation and the City of Seattle desire to maintain the size of the overall park land as reflected in the original project plan and keep the bulkhead at its original length, at an additional cost of $4,228,000; and
