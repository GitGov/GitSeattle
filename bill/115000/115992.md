 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation, authorizing the grant of an easement over an 11,928 square foot parcel of land at the southwest corner of Discovery Park to allow the continued maintenance of a seawall that has existed since before the creation of the Park and to allow the maintenance and landscaping of the area behind the seawall in a manner that is not incompatible with the natural environment of the adjoining portion of Discovery Park, finding that this transaction is not subject to the requirements of Ordinance 118477, and in consideration of the agreement by the National Parks Service to release the area of this easement from the Declaration of Restrictions in the deed conveying this land to the City of Seattle, authorizing the acceptance of a Deed of Release and the execution of a new Declaration of Restrictions to limit the use of the land known as the Kiwanis Ravine Green Space to public park purposes; and authorizing acceptance of funds in exchange for the easement.

 WHEREAS, an 11,928 square foot parcel of land at the southwest corner of Discovery Park ("the Park"), west of unopened 48th Avenue West, is subject to encroachment by a seawall that has existed since before the creation of the Park; and

 WHEREAS, a private residence and real property in the area of the seawall, as well as the portion of unopened 48th Avenue West that abuts Puget Sound, are protected from erosion by this seawall; and

 WHEREAS, the principal value of this parcel to the Park is as passive open space over which the bluff within the Park can be viewed from the tidelands at low tide; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR") has hired an independent appraiser who has determined the economic value of the fee interest in this area west of 48th Avenue West that includes the seawall; and

 WHEREAS, the owners of the residence that is protected by the seawall, and who maintain the seawall, have offered to purchase an easement to this area west of 48th Avenue West for the purpose of maintaining the seawall, stabilizing the area, and maintaining and landscaping the area behind the seawall in a naturalistic manner that is not incompatible with the natural environment of the adjoining portion of the Park; and

 WHEREAS, in exchange for the easement the owners of the residence that is protected by the seawall, and who maintain the seawall, have agreed to pay the appraised value of the fee interest in this area ($25,000), have deposited this appraised value into escrow, and are prepared to enter into a Seawall Maintenance and Landscaping Easement Agreement with the City of Seattle ("City"); and

 WHEREAS, the Board of Park Commissioners and the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation ("Superintendent") have recommended that the Seattle City Council ("Council") authorize DPR to grant the proposed easement; and

 WHEREAS, the City has acquired land known as the Kiwanis Ravine Green Space, that is located one block east of the Park and is an important open space and heron habitat; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate that the funds received for the easement be used to help defray the cost of establishing the easement and purchasing the Kiwanis Ravine Green Space; and

 WHEREAS, the National Park Service has approved the grant of the easement and has agreed to release the area of the easement from the Declaration of Restrictions that limits the Park to park use, on the condition that the City impose the same restrictions on the Kiwanis Ravine Green Space; and

 WHEREAS, the Council agrees that a similar Declaration of Restrictions should be imposed on the Kiwanis Ravine Green Space; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council finds that the proposed grant of easement is not subject to the requirements of Ordinance 118477 because the use of the land is not changing from what it has been since before the creation of the Park, and the easement requires the continued maintenance of the land and its landscaping in a naturalistic manner that is not incompatible with the adjoining portion of the Park; and

 power and authority contained in the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 337), as amended (the "Act"), and regulations and orders promulgated thereunder (hereinafter designated "Grantor"), to City of Seattle ("Grantee"), and its assigns.

Recitals:

 A.

 B. The Discovery Park Property was conveyed to Grantee upon the express condition that the Discovery Park Property was to be used exclusively for public park and recreational purposes and certain restrictions were expressly set forth as paragraphs 1 through 12 of the Quitclaim Deed (collectively, the "Restrictions").

 C. Subsequent to the said conveyance of August 30, 1972, Grantee sought to convey an exclusive, perpetual easement to an adjacent landowner for the purpose of maintaining a seawall on the Discovery Park Property over an area of 11,928 square feet, as more fully described on Schedule 1 attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Exchange Property"), and to obtain a release of the said condition that the Exchange Property was to be used exclusively for public park and recreation purposes, in exchange for which Grantee would acquire other real property, as more fully described in Schedule 2 attached hereto and made a part hereof, consisting of 21,119 square feet, more of less, known as the Kiwanis Ravine Property and located at 4441 Brygger Drive West, Seattle, Washington (the "Kiwanis Ravine Property") and would impose a condition that the Kiwanis Ravine Property be used exclusively for public park and recreation purposes, as required pursuant to the Act.

The Kiwanis Ravine Property shall be used and maintained exclusively for public park and recreational purposes in perpetuity as set forth in the program of utilization and plan contained in Grantor's application submitted to Grantee by Grantor on 07/14/2006 (the "Program of Utilization"), which program and plan may be amended from time to time at the written request of either the Grantor or Grantee, with the written concurrence of the other party, and such amendments will be added to and become a part of the original application.

 2. The Grantor shall, within 6 months of the date of this Declaration of Restrictions, erect and maintain a permanent sign or marker near the point of principal access to the Kiwanis Ravine Property indicating that the Kiwanis Ravine Property is a park or recreation area and has been acquired in substitution for property acquired from the Federal Government through the Federal Lands to Parks Program of the U.S. Department of the Interior, for use by the general public.

 3. The Kiwanis Ravine Property shall not be sold, leased, assigned or otherwise disposed of except to another eligible governmental agency that the Secretary of the Interior approves in writing. Any such disposition shall assure the continued use and maintenance of the Kiwanis Ravine Property for public park or public recreational purposes subject to the same terms and conditions in this Declaration of Restrictions. Any mortgage, lien, or any other encumbrance not wholly subordinate to the interest of the Grantee in this Declaration of Restrictions shall constitute an impermissible disposal. However, this provision shall not preclude the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns from using revenue or other bonds related to the use of the Kiwanis Ravine Property to the extent that such bonds shall not in any way restrict, encumber, or constitute a lien on the Kiwanis Ravine Property. Furthermore, this provision shall not preclude the Grantor from providing related recreation facilities and services compatible with the approved application though concession agreements, permits, and licenses entered into with third parties, provided prior concurrence to such agreements is obtained in writing from the National Park Service.

 4. Funds generated on the Kiwanis Ravine Property may not be expended for non-recreational purposes. Until the Kiwanis Ravine Property has been fully developed in accordance with the Program of Utilization, all revenues generated on the Kiwanis Ravine Property must be used for the development, operation, and maintenance of the Kiwanis Ravine Property. After the Kiwanis Ravine Property has been fully developed in accordance with the Program of Utilization, revenue generated by the Kiwanis Ravine Property may be expended on other recreation properties operated by Grantor.

 5. From the date of this Declaration of Restrictions, the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, shall submit biennial reports to the Secretary of the Interior, setting forth the use made of the Kiwanis Ravine Property during the preceding two-year period, and other pertinent data establishing its continuous use for the purposes set forth above, for ten consecutive reports or as further determined by the Secretary of the Interior.

 6. Grantor further covenants and agrees for itself, its heirs, successors and assigns, that: (1) any use, operation, program or activity on or related to the Kiwanis Ravine Property will be conducted in compliance with all Federal laws and regulations relating to nondiscrimination, including but not limited to the following laws and regulations as may be amended from time to time: (a) the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior at 43 CFR Part 17, (b) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (c) Title III of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, (d) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and (e) the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968; (2) this covenant shall be subject in all respects to the provisions of said laws and regulations; (3) the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, will promptly take and continue to take such action as may be necessary to effectuate this covenant; (4) the United States shall have the right to seek judicial enforcement of this covenant; (5) the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, will (a) obtain from each other person (any legal entity) who, through contractual or other arrangements with the Grantor, its heirs, successors or assigns, is authorized to provide services or benefits on or in connection with the Kiwanis Ravine Property, a written agreement pursuant to which such other person shall, with respect to the services or benefits which he is authorized to provide, undertake for himself the same obligations as those imposed upon the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, by this covenant, and (b) furnish a copy of such agreement to the Secretary of the Interior or his successor or assign; (6) this covenant shall run with the land hereby conveyed, and shall in any event, without regard to technical classification or designation, legal or otherwise, be binding to the fullest extent permitted by law and equity for the benefit of, and in favor of the Grantee and enforceable by the Grantee against the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns; and (7) the Grantee shall have a right of access to, and entrance upon, the Kiwanis Ravine Property in order to determine compliance with the terms of this conveyance.

 7. The Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, shall indemnify, defend, protect, save and hold harmless the Grantee, its employees, officers, attorneys, agents, and representatives from and against any and all debts, duties, obligations, liabilities, law suits, claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, consultant fees and expenses, expert fees and expenses, and court costs) arising out of any claim for personal injury or property damage (including death, illness, or loss of or damage to real or personal property or economic loss) that relates to the Grantor's failure to comply with the terms of this Declaration of Restrictions or from the use or occupancy of the Kiwanis Ravine Property by the Grantor, it heirs, successors, assigns, transferees, or agents.

 8. In the event that there is a breach by the Grantor, its heirs, successors or assigns, of any of the covenants, conditions or restrictions set forth herein, whether caused by the legal or other inability of the Grantor, its heirs, successors or assigns, to perform said covenants, conditions or restrictions, the Grantee will give written notice, with a reasonable time stated therein, for the elimination, rectification or cure of said breach. Upon failure to eliminate, rectify or cure said breach within the time set forth in the notice, all right, title, and interest in and to the Kiwanis Ravine Property shall, at the Grantee's option, become the property of Grantee. In addition to all other remedies for such breach, the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, at the Grantee's option, shall forfeit all right, title, and interest in any and all of the tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereunto belonging.

 9. The failure of the Grantee to require in any one or more instances complete performance of any of the conditions or covenants shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such future performance, but obligation of the Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and effect.

 10. The National Park Service and any representative it may so delegate shall have the right of entry upon the Kiwanis Ravine Property at all reasonable times to conduct inspections of the Kiwanis Ravine Property for the purposes of evaluating the Grantor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Declaration of Restrictions.

 11. The Grantor covenants and agrees for itself, its heirs, successors and assigns, that in the event the Grantee exercises its option as set forth in paragraph 8 above to have all right, title, and interest in and to the Kiwanis Ravine Property become Grantee's property, or the Grantor voluntarily conveys title to the Kiwanis Ravine Property, then the Grantor shall provide protection to and maintenance of said property at all times until such time as the title is actually accepted by the Grantee, including the period of any notice of intent to exercise Grantee's rights. Such protection and maintenance shall, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed by the General Services Administration in its regulations 41 CFR 102-75.690 as such may be amended.

 12. The covenants, conditions, and restrictions set forth herein are intended to be covenants running with the land in accordance with all applicable law and shall burden and run with the Kiwanis Ravine Property and every part thereof or interest therein, and shall be binding on Grantor, its heirs, successors, assigns, and every successor in interest to all or any part of the property, and shall benefit Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns. All restrictions and conditions contained herein are for the sole benefit of the United States of America and may be modified or abrogated by the Secretary of the Interior, or his successor in function, as provided by the Act.
