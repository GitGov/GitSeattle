 The purpose of this code is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code.

NOTE: The minimum standards of the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code, SMC 22.200-22.208, do not apply to any structure constructed and maintained in compliance with standards and procedures of the Seattle Building, Residential, Mechanical, Fire, Electrical and Plumbing Codes currently in effect.

 R101.3 Scope. The provisions of this code apply to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, removal and demolition of detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (townhouses) not more than three stories above grade in height with a separate means of egress, and their accessory structures, including adult family homes, foster family care homes and family day care homes licensed by the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services.

~~Existing buildings undergoing repair, alteration or additions, and change of occupancy and moved buildings shall comply with Chapter 34 of the Seattle Building Code. Existing mechanical systems shall comply with Section 104 of the Seattle Mechanical Code or Section 104 of the Seattle Fuel Gas Code~~~~.~~

 Section 2. Subsection R105.2 of the Seattle Residential Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION R105

 BUILDING PERMITS

 R105.2 Work exempt from permit. A building permit shall not be required for the work listed below.

 SECTION R109

 EXISTING STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT

 R109.1 General. Buildings in existence at the time of the passage of this code which were legally constructed and occupied in accordance with the provisions of a prior code may have their existing use continued, provided such use is not unsafe.

 Mechanical systems lawfully in existence at the time of the adoption of this code may have their use, maintenance or repair, conversion of fuel, or component replacement continued if the use, maintenance, repair, conversion of fuel, or component replacement is in accordance with the basic original design and location, and no hazard to life, health or property has been created by such mechanical system.

 R109.2 Legalizing existing uses. In order to legalize an existing use for the record, it is required that the building comply with the fire and life safety requirements of this code or the code effective at the time the building was constructed. If the existing use is other than that for which the building was constructed, the building shall comply with this code or the code effective at the time the existing use was legally established.

 R109.3 Maintenance. All buildings or structures, both existing and new, and all parts thereof shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. All mechanical systems, materials and appurtenances, both existing and new, and all parts thereof shall be maintained in proper operating condition in accordance with the original design and in a safe and hazard-free condition. All devices or safeguards which are or were required by a code in effect when the building or structure was erected, altered, or repaired shall be maintained in good working order. To determine compliance with this subsection, the building official may cause a mechanical system or equipment to be reinspected.

 The owner or a designated agent shall be responsible for maintenance of buildings, structures, mechanical systems and equipment. It is unlawful to fail to so maintain these parts of the building or equipment or to fail to immediately comply with any lawful notice or order of the fire chief or the building official.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. The building official may modify the requirements of this subsection where all or a portion of a building is unoccupied, closed off and reasonably secure from unlawful entry.

 2. Occupants of dwellings shall be responsible for the maintenance of smoke alarms required by Section R313 and the International Fire Code.

 R109.4 Unsafe building appendages. Parapet walls, cornices, chimneys and other appendages or structural members which are supported by, attached to, or a part of a building and which are in a deteriorated condition or are otherwise unable to sustain the design loads which are specified in this code, are hereby designated as unsafe building appendages. All such unsafe building appendages are public nuisances and shall be abated in accordance with Section R102 of this code.

 R109.5 Additions, alterations or repairs

 R109.5.1 General. Buildings and structures to which additions, alterations or repairs are made shall comply with all the requirements of this code for new facilities except as specifically provided in this section. See also applicable provisions of the Seattle Energy Code.

 Any building or addition that exceeds the scope of this code shall be designed to the provisions of the SBC.

 Exception: An existing nonconforming building to which an addition is made may exceed the limitations of the preceding paragraph if the following conditions are met:

 1. A fire wall, constructed per SBC 705, separates the addition and the existing structure;~~~~2. The existing building is not made more nonconforming; and

 3. The addition conforms to this code.

 R109.5.2 When allowed. Additions, alterations or repairs may be made to any building or structure without requiring the existing building or structure to comply with all the requirements of this code, provided the addition, alteration or repair conforms to that required for a new building or structure.

 Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs may be made to any mechanical system without requiring the existing mechanical system to comply with all the requirements of this code, provided the addition, alteration, renovation or repair conforms to that required for a new mechanical system. Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs shall not cause an existing system to become unsafe, unhealthy or overloaded.

 Minor additions, alterations, renovations, and repairs to existing mechanical systems may be installed in accordance with the law in effect at the time the original installation was made, when approved by the building official.

 R109.5.4 Impracticality. In cases where total compliance with all the requirements of this code is impractical, the applicant may arrange a pre-submittal conference with the design team and the building official. The applicant shall identify alternate design solutions and modifications and demonstrate comformance to Section R104.10 or R104.11. The building official may waive specific requirements in this code which he/she has determined to be impractical.

Alterations and repairs to existing buildings which are being made in response to a notice or order requiring compliance with the Housing and Building Maintenance Code, Subtitle II, Title 22 of the Seattle Municipal Code, Fire Code or other ordinances applicable to existing buildings, shall be permitted to be made in accordance with the standards contained in those ordinances, rather than the standards for new buildings contained in this code. Where standards are not specified in those ordinances, such alterations or repairs must conform to the requirements of this chapter.

 R109.5.6 Non-structural alterations or repairs. Alterations or repairs which are non-structural and do not affect any member or part of the building or structure having required fire-resistance may be made with the same materials of which the building or structure is constructed, provided that no change is permitted which increases its hazard.

 R109.5.7 Maintenance of structural stability. When approved by the building official, minor structural alterations or repairs necessary to maintain the structural stability of the building may be made with the same material of which the building or structure is constructed.

 R109.5.8 Historic buildings and structures.
