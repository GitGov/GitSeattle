 WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the Lower Duwamish Waterway on the National Priorities List on September 13, 2001, thereby designating it a Superfund Site; and

 WHEREAS, on April 19, 2000, the City of Seattle, the Port of Seattle, King County, and The Boeing Company signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with EPA and the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), thereby agreeing to investigate contamination in the Lower Duwamish Waterway and to explore options for remediation; and

 WHEREAS, King County, the City of Seattle, the Port of Seattle, and The Boeing Company are sharing the costs of the work required by the AOC; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities is working with King County and Ecology to identify and control existing and potential sources of contamination to the Lower Duwamish Waterway; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, King County, and the Port of Seattle, as public agencies, may apply for state grants under the authority of the Model Toxic Control Act to pay for 50% of their costs for some of the activities associated with the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site; and

 WHEREAS, the river-wide work being performed under the AOC is ongoing and currently expected to continue beyond the current budget cycle; and

 WHEREAS, the investigation has identified several areas in the Lower Duwamish Waterway as candidate sites for Early Actions to remove contaminants before the river-wide investigation is complete; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is a Potentially Responsible Party at the Slip 4 and the T117 Early Action Areas; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has negotiated a cost-sharing arrangement with the Port of Seattle for investigation and cleanup of the T117 Early Action Area where the Port has the lead management role; and

 WHEREAS, EPA has proposed additional orders for clean-up of the Slip 4 and T117 Early Actions; and

 Section 3.

If the Council adopts a resolution authorizing negotiations, then the Executive may proceed in accordance with the Council's resolution.

 Section 5. The Executive shall brief the Council before negotiating any new cost-sharing agreements for studies or activities in the Lower Duwamish, other than those authorized in this ordinance for the T117 and Slip 4 Early Actions. If the Council adopts a resolution authorizing negotiations, then the Executive may proceed in accordance with the resolution.

 Section 6. Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities are also authorized to seek and to accept Remedial Action Grants from the Washington State Department of Ecology for work related to the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site, including the Early Actions and source control efforts.

 Section 9. The utilities shall include the Duwamish Superfund Site, including the Slip 4 and T117 Early Action Areas, in the utilities' annual budgets, and report on the the Duwamish RI/FS studies, Slip 4 and T117 Early Action Areas, in the Quarterly budget reports to the Council..

 Section 10. Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities will provide semiannual progress reports regarding the Lower Duwamish Waterway to the appropriate committees of the Council.
