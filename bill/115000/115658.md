 WHEREAS, the Seattle Comprehensive Plan defines a goal for Northgate to become a thriving, vital, mixed-use center of concentrated development surrounded by healthy single-family neighborhoods, and has policies to create a transit-supportive environment that emphasizes multi-modal transportation solutions including improved pedestrian, bicycle, bus transit, and high-capacity transit facilities and services; and

 WHEREAS, the Draft Northgate Coordinated Transportation Investment Plan (CTIP) identifies current and future transportation and traffic problems in the Northgate area, and recognizes that transportation planning and improvements are key to successfully accommodating future development and managing growth; and
