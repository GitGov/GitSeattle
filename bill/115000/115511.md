 a. ~~seasonal assignments to perform a short-term, recurring body of work not associated with a regularly budgeted position that is dependent on time of year, customer demand or some other predictable factor; and~~b.

an interim assignment~~s~~ of up to one year to a vacant regular position to perform work associated with a regularly budgeted position ~~because the position~~that is temporarily vacant and has no incumbent.~~or otherwise assigned; and~~; or

~~c. on-call assignments to perform work associated with event support that is intermittent and as-needed, and which may be sporadically or irregularly scheduled, or may regularly consist of fewer straight-time hours per month than are necessary to qualify for health care coverage~~under the City's benefits programs; and

b. an interim assignment for short-term replacement of a regular employee of up to one year when the incumbent is temporarily absent; or  c. a short-term assignment of up to one year, which may be extended beyond one year only while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position, to perform work that is not ongoing regular work and for which there is no regularly budgeted position; or

~~d. short-term or emergency assignments to perform a body of work not associated with a regularly budgeted position in response to short-term, emergency or unplanned needs.~~

d. a less than half-time assignment for seasonal, on-call, intermittent or regularly scheduled work that normally does not exceed 1040 hours in a year, but may be extended up to 1300 hours once every three years and may also be extended while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position; or  e. a term-limited assignment for a period of more than one but less than three years for time-limited work related to a specific project, grant or other non-routine substantial body of work, or for the replacement of a regularly appointed employee when that employee is absent on long-term disability time loss, medical or military leave of absence.

 For purposes of administering temporary assignments, one year shall be equivalent to 26 consecutive pay periods. The Personnel Director may promulgate rules that direct departments to limit temporary assignments to fewer hours than this ordinance provides for.

Except as may be provided by ordinance or labor contract, temporary workers shall be exempt from the provisions of this title.

 Section 2. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.055 is retitled and amended as follows:

Temporary workers in interim, short-term and less than half-time assignments to titles that correspond to regular job titles associated with any of the City's discretionary pay programs, including but not necessarily limited to the Accountability Pay for Executives, Strategic Advisor and Manager, and Information Technology Professional pay programs, may be paid any rate within the pay band associated with the corresponding regular job title, at the discretion of the appointing authority.

B. Except as provided in Subsection ~~B~~C below, the City will pay all temporary ~~City employees~~workers the following ~~prospective~~premium pay rates in lieu of paid leave and benefits, based on cumulative non-overtime hours worked by each employee:

 1. Temporary workers in interim and short-term assignments after ~~nine hundred sixteen (916)~~one thousand forty (1040) regular straight-time hours, for the remainder of the assignment, provided that the Personnel Director may promulgate rules to provide for the continuation of premium pay in lieu of wage progression and benefits when he or she determines that the assignment will terminate so imminently that the benefits package would be of minimal value to the worker; and

 2. Temporary workers in ~~other types of temporary~~term-limited assignments starting with the first day and for the duration of their assignments~~that, in the judgment of the appointing authority and the Personnel Director have developed into regular, ongoing work, after nine hundred sixteen (916) regular straight-time hours and until the work is assigned to a regularly budgeted position or terminated~~.

3. Temporary workers in any assignment that the appointing authority has proposed be converted to regular position authority, regardless of the number of hours accumulated in the assignment to date.

~~C~~D. Temporary workers in assignments identified in Subsection ~~B~~C as eligible for benefits shall receive the following benefits and wage progression at the same level and under the same conditions as regularly appointed employees as well as any other benefits that the City agrees to provide to temporary workers pursuant to an authorized collective bargaining agreement:

The City of Seattle, King County Superior Court Cause No. 844600, Section 3~~.

F. The Personnel Director shall promulgate rules that are consistent with the City's collective bargaining agreements to allow temporary workers who do not qualify for the fringe benefits package described in subsection D to purchase health care coverage and optional insurance coverage

G. A temporary worker who receives an appointment to a position within the classified service shall be compensated at the pay rate established for initial appointment in the pay program associated with that position; provided, that if the temporary worker is appointed without a voluntary break in service in excess of thirty (30) days and has worked as a temporary worker in excess of five hundred twenty (520) straight-time hours, he or she shall have his or her straight-time hours credited for purposes of salary step placement if applicable under rules promulgated by the Personnel Director.

H. The Personnel Director is authorized to establish temporary job titles that correspond to any classified service or exempt job title that exists now or is hereafter created by ordinance, to assign such temporary job titles salary ranges or pay zones that are equivalent to those assigned to the corresponding regular titles and to make the same adjustments to such salary ranges or pay zones as are approved by ordinance for the corresponding regular titles.

 Section 7. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.34.005, Subsections A and E, are hereby amended as follows:

 4.34.005 Definitions

 A. "Employee" means an individual who works for wages or a salary in the service of the City other than (1) a person elected or appointed to a term of office, or (2) a person who, individually or with others, is the head of an employing unit. It includes full-time and part-time

 personnel, and temporary workers who receive fringe benefits in lieu of premium pay, but not temporary workers who receive premium pay.

 * * *

 E. "Temporary worker" has the meaning given in Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.030~~means a person who is hired for:~~

~~a. seasonal assignments to perform a short-term, recurring body of work not associated with a regularly budgeted position that is dependent on time of year, customer demand or some other predictable factor, and;~~

~~b. interim assignments to perform work associated with a regularly budgeted position because the position is temporarily vacant or the incumbent is absent or otherwise assigned; and~~

~~c. on-call assignments to perform work associated with event support that is intermittent and as-needed, and which may be sporadically or irregularly scheduled, or may regularly consist of fewer straight-time hours per month than are necessary to qualify for health care coverage under the City's benefits programs; and~~

~~d. short-term or emergency assignments to perform a body of work not associated with a regularly budgeted position in response to short-term, emergency or unplanned needs~~.

 Section 8. There is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.04 a new section, 4.04.280, Temporary employment oversight and compliance systems, as follows:

 4.04.280 Temporary employment oversight and compliance systems.

 A. The Personnel Director or his or her designated management representative shall develop, implement and administer such temporary assignment approval and tracking systems and procedures as are necessary to ensure that assignments are managed consistent with applicable ordinances and personnel rules and the Settlement Agreement in Glaser et al v. City of Seattle, during the term of that Agreement.

 B. The Personnel Director shall implement, promulgate rules for and manage a process, consistent with the Glaser v. City of Seattle Settlement Agreement during the term of that Agreement whereby temporary workers in short-term and less-than-half-time assignments may appeal to an assignment review committee to seek conversion of their assignment to a regularly budgeted position or term-limited assignment when:

 1. the worker's current assignment has exceeded the hours limitation associated with it (i.e., 1040 hours for a less-than-half- time assignment and 1 year for a short-term assignment) and the worker believes he or she is performing an ongoing body of work; or

 2. the worker is 1 of 2 or more workers who are assigned substantially the same work in the same department and the worker believes the assignments should be aggregated and assigned to one (or more) regular position(s).

 C. If the outcome of the appeal process is the conversion of the temporary assignment(s) to a new or vacant regular position, the temporary worker shall be assigned to the position on an interim basis and receive compensation and fringe benefits as provided at SMC 4.20.055 until an internal competitive hiring process is completed. Such process shall take into account and give substantial weight to the experience of the temporary worker performing the work of the position on an interim basis.

 D. The Personnel Director shall provide by rule for a temporary worker to challenge the outcome of the appeal process to a City of Seattle hearing examiner or, at the City's option and expense, to an independent arbitrator for final determination.

 E. A temporary worker assigned to a term-limited assignment may avail him or herself of the appeal process described in this section if his or her current assignment has exceeded or will exceed 3 years. If the appeal determination is further appealed to a hearing examiner or arbitrator and the temporary worker prevails and the City Council consequently authorizes new position authority for the body of work, the temporary worker shall be appointed to the regular position and his or her time worked in the assignment to date shall be counted toward the 12-month probationary period.

 F. A temporary employee assigned to a vacant regular position that exceeds one year may avail him or herself of the appeal process described in this section. A temporary worker in an interim assignment to a vacant regular position on or after November 16, 2005, whose assignment in that position exceeds 1 year, shall be appointed to the regular vacant position and shall have regular status upon appointment.

 G. Whenever a temporary assignment is recommended for conversion to a regular position the Personal Director may extend the time limits on the assignment as provided in SMC 4.04.030. If the conversion does not require the creation of new position authority, the Personnel Director may extend the assignment up to 90 days. If the assignment conversion requires the creation of new position authority, the Personnel Director may extend the assignment for the length of time required to obtain legislative approval of such authority; provided, that if the Mayor declines to recommend or the City Council declines to approve new position authority, the assignment must terminate within 30 calendar days of the rejection of the conversion proposal and the work must cease or must be assigned to a regular or probationary employee.

 Section 9. To the extent that provisions of this ordinance pertain to terms and conditions of employment that are subject to collective bargaining and are not otherwise required by law, such provisions do not supersede the collective bargaining agreements or the right of the collective bargaining agents to bargain over the terms and conditions of employment.

 Section 10. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.145, Policies concerning temporary employees, is hereby repealed.

 Section 11. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.255, Determinations regarding exemptions from Civil Service, is hereby repealed.

 Section 12. Ordinance No. 114682, relating to temporary workers hired by the City; authorizing the Personnel Director to establish new payroll titles for use by such staff, is hereby repealed.

 Section 13. Any acts made prior to and consistent with this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 14. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
