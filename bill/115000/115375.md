 AN ORDINANCE relating to the acquisition and management of real property and property interests on the Cedar River below Landsburg Dam, in King County; authorizing Seattle Public Utilities to acquire specified properties or conservation easements and to accept applicable deeds; authorizing Seattle Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Cascade Land Conservancy for land acquisition and management services; and authorizing Seattle Public Utilities to convey easements or stewardship assignments in connection with the Conservancy's management responsibilities.

 WHEREAS, under the Cedar River Habitat Conservation Plan dated April 21, 2000 ("HCP"), the City of Seattle (the "City") is obligated to expend specified amounts of money to protect, through 2050, fish habitat on the Cedar River below the City's Landsburg Dam, in King County; and

 WHEREAS, the City, acting though Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU"), desires to fulfill its obligations under the HCP primarily by acquiring appropriate properties in fee simple or landowner conservation easements in such properties from willing sellers; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has determined that it is most efficient and cost- effective if Cascade Land Conservancy ("CLC") negotiates for and manages the designated properties or property interests on behalf of SPU; and

 WHEREAS, CLC is willing and able to provide the land acquisition and ongoing stewardship services that SPU requires, so long as fish habitat in the acquired properties can be protected permanently; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities or his designee (the "Director") is hereby authorized to execute the Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat (the "Agreement"), substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment 1. Under the Agreement, (a) CLC, on behalf of the City, will negotiate and enter into purchase and sale agreements to acquire fee ownership of, or landowner conservation easements on, properties designated in Exhibit A to the Agreement, (b) CLC will assign the purchase and sale agreements to the City prior to closing, (c) if a landowner conservation easement has been acquired, the City will enter into a stewardship assignment that obligates CLC to provide stewardship services for the property for so long as the City holds the landowner conservation easement, but without charge to the City after 2050, and (d) if a property has been acquired in fee simple and CLC has so requested, the City will grant CLC a non-exclusive, permanent conservation-stewardship easement that obligates CLC to provide stewardship services for so long as the City owns the property, but without charge to the City after 2050. The City's obligation under clause (d) is conditioned on CLC's payment of the difference in value of a conservation-stewardship easement terminating in 2050 and that of a permanent easement. If CLC does not pay such amount, the conservation-stewardship easement will terminate in 2050. The provisions of Seattle Municipal Code chapter 20.50 do not apply to the property acquisition and management services authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 2. With respect to the properties and conservation easements to be acquired by the City, the Director of SPU is authorized to execute and accept deeds for fee ownership or landowner conservation easements (the form of which easement is attached to the Agreement as Exhibit C). The Director may accept said deeds on behalf of the City by indicating his written acceptance thereon. The property so acquired shall be placed under the jurisdiction of SPU.

 Section 3. The Director is authorized to grant conservation- stewardship easements to CLC, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to the Agreement, and to enter into stewardship assignments, substantially in the form set forth in Appendix F of Exhibit C to the Agreement.

 Section 4. The Director is authorized to execute such other documents and take such actions as he or she deems necessary to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance. With respect to the forms of documents that are attached to the Agreement, the Director may make changes in such forms as are consistent with the purposes of this ordinance.

 ATTACHMENT 1 TO ORDINANCE AGREEMENT FOR ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISH HABITAT

 This Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat (the "Agreement") is entered into as of the ___ day of ______, 2005, by and between The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through Seattle Public Utilities (the "City"), and Cascade Land Conservancy, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("CLC"). The City or CLC may be referred to herein as a "Party" and both as the "Parties."

 Recitals A. As a party to the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan dated April 21, 2000, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time ("HCP"), the City has made a commitment to contribute specified amounts of money to acquire, restore, enhance and/or protect high quality spawning, rearing or refuge habitat for anadromous fish species, and the natural features and processes sustaining such habitat, along the mainstem of the lower Cedar River below Landsburg Dam ("Fish Habitat") until the expiration of the HCP on December 31, 2050.

 B. The City has identified properties that meet the requirements and objectives of the HCP. These properties are listed in Exhibit A hereto.

 C. CLC's charitable mission is to protect our region's wild and open space lands to sustain the natural beauty and health of the environment, now and for generations to come.

 D. CLC desires to assist the City in protecting Fish Habitat by acquiring, managing and protecting properties from the list in Exhibit A, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Program"). The Program is consistent with and supports CLC's mission.

 E. In accordance with its mission, CLC desires to permanently preserve the Fish Habitat on properties acquired by the City in fee simple under the Program. To accomplish perpetual preservation, CLC would pay the difference between the present value of each such property subject to a perpetual conservation-stewardship easement and the present value of each such property subject to a conservation-stewardship easement terminating on December 31, 2050 (as further described in Section 2.G(iii), the "CLC Portion").

 Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

 Agreement Section 1. Effective Date and Termination

 This Agreement shall be in full force and effect beginning on the date provided above ("Effective Date") and shall expire upon written notice from the City to CLC that the acquisition phase of the Program has ended in accordance with section 2. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party; provided, that all obligations incurred prior to the date of termination shall survive until fulfilled. In the event of such termination by CLC, any then-existing City Conservation Easements or City Stewardship Assignments (each as hereinafter defined) shall terminate automatically, regardless of whether CLC has paid the CLC Portion. In the event of such termination by the City, the City may leave any then-existing City Conservation Easements or City Stewardship Assignments in effect or, in the City's sole discretion, require their termination. For City Stewardship Assignments and those City Conservation Easements for which CLC has not paid the CLC Portion, termination shall be effective upon notice from the City. For City

 Conservation Easements for which the CLC Portion has been paid, termination shall be effective upon the City's reimbursement of the CLC Portion with interest at the rate of 4.5% per annum. Upon request, CLC shall execute such documents as the City reasonably requests to evidence termination of City Conservation Easements or City Stewardship Assignments, and the City may record such documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, City Conservation Easements and City Stewardship Assignments may be terminated by the City for cause in accordance with the terms of such instruments.

 Section 2. Property Acquisition Projects A. The acquisition phase of the Program shall begin on the Effective Date and shall end on the earlier of the date on which the City has expended $3,000,000 in Acquisition Costs (as defined in Section 3.B) for Acquisition Projects (as defined in Section 2.F) or July 31, 2007; provided that such dollar amount may be increased and/or such date extended or thereafter at the written request of the City. During this time, CLC shall seek to acquire interests in land only from among those properties listed in Exhibit A or, with the prior written approval of the City, CLC may acquire interests in other parcels that contain Fish Habitat and are contiguous with parcels in Exhibit A that previously have been acquired under this Agreement (each, a "Potential Property" and collectively the "Potential Properties"). CLC agrees to make diligent efforts to acquire the Potential Properties from willing landowners in the time and manner contemplated by this Agreement. CLC agrees to subcontract the acquisition of half the Acquisition Projects (as defined in Section 2.F) to Open Space Resources of Langley, Washington ("OSR") in accordance with Section 2.G(i). CLC and OSR shall responsibly coordinate the management of the Acquisition Projects; provided, that all agreements pertaining to the Acquisition Project shall be executed by CLC and all third-party costs shall be billed to CLC. CLC shall bill the City for OSR's work, plus a 7.5% administrative fee and the cost of preparation of the Present Conditions Report (as hereinafter defined), all in accordance with Section 3 and/or 4, as applicable. With respect to Acquisition Projects managed by OSR, CLC shall not charge the City for any CLC Administrative Costs (as hereinafter defined) other than the 7.5% fee and the cost of the Present Conditions Report.

 B. The Parties shall confer on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as needed, to identify, from within the list of Potential Properties, those properties to be given priority in the acquisition process (each a "Priority Property" and collectively the "Priority Properties"). After each such consultation, CLC shall prepare a list of such Priority Properties, identifying which Priority Property acquisitions will be managed by CLC and which will be managed by OSR, and indicating any priority ranking within such Priority Properties. The City shall provide written approval of the then-current list of such Priority Properties. Once the acquisition process has begun, CLC will conduct weekly telephone briefings and bi-monthly in-person meetings with OSR and City staff managing the Program throughout the acquisition phase. During these briefings and meetings, CLC will provide the City with information about active projects, including parcel number, location, progress on negotiations with landowners, title report findings and related issues needing to be resolved, appraisal findings, and any other information relevant to the current land acquisition projects. In the event that two Priority Properties with different priority rankings are both available, and funds are limited, the Priority Property with the higher ranking will take precedence.

 C. The Parties agree that, in most instances, the City's habitat protection goals under the HCP can be accomplished most efficiently and economically as follows: (i) CLC enters into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire fee ownership of a Priority Property; (ii) CLC assigns its interests in the purchase and sale agreement to the City prior to closing (as set forth in Exhibit G, the "PSA Assignment"); (iii) the City closes on acquisition of the Priority Property ("Acquired Property"); (iv) the City conveys to CLC at closing a non-exclusive term conservation-stewardship easement, expiring on December 31, 2050, over the Acquired Property that provides for management and preservation, and potential enhancement and restoration, of Fish Habitat on the Acquired Property; and (v) CLC manages the Acquired Property in accordance with the terms of such easement; provided, that if CLC pays the CLC Portion applicable to a particular Acquired Property, the City shall convey to CLC at closing a non- exclusive perpetual (rather than term) conservation-stewardship easement subject to the termination provisions therein. The general form of the conservation- stewardship easement is shown in Exhibit B (the "City Conservation Easement"). The Parties may also enter into a separate property-specific enhancement and/or restoration agreement for any Acquired Property that provides for CLC's active enhancement and/or restoration of Fish Habitat on the Acquired Property.

 D. Alternatively, when the owner of a Priority Property does not wish to convey fee title, the Parties may proceed as follows: (i) CLC enters into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a permanent conservation easement over a Priority Property that specifies the permissible and impermissible uses of such property, including potential habitat enhancement or restoration, and provides for enforcement rights with respect to protection of Fish Habitat; (ii) CLC assigns its interest in the purchase and sale agreement to the City prior to closing pursuant to the PSA Assignment; (iii) the City closes on acquisition of the conservation easement over the Priority Property ("Acquired Easement

 Property"); (iv) the City assigns to CLC at closing specified stewardship responsibilities, as well as any habitat enhancement or restoration rights that may be appropriate under the conservation easement for the Acquired Easement Property through a stewardship assignment that continues in effect for so long as the City holds the conservation easement, subject to the termination provisions therein; and (v) CLC manages the Acquired Easement Property as provided in the stewardship assignment The general form of such easement and assignment is shown in Exhibit C hereto and referred to as a "Landowner Conservation Easement" and "City Stewardship Assignment." CLC may make material changes to the form Landowner Conservation Easement and City Stewardship Assignment for a given Priority Property only upon the prior written approval of the City. The Parties may also enter into a separate property-specific enhancement and/or restoration agreement for any Acquired Easement Property that provides for CLC's active enhancement and/or restoration of Fish Habitat on the Acquired Easement Property. Except as noted herein, the property acquisition, funding and closing procedures outlined in Sections 2 through 4 of this Agreement are the same regardless of whether fee title or a Landowner Conservation Easement is being acquired.

 E. CLC shall enter into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire each Priority Property in fee simple, except where the Parties determine in consultation to acquire a Landowner Conservation Easement and the City provides written direction to do so. The form of purchase agreement for acquisition of either fee title or a Landowner Conservation Easement is shown in Exhibit D hereto and referred to as a "Purchase and Sale Agreement." CLC may make material changes to the form Purchase and Sale Agreement for a given Priority Property upon prior written approval of the City.

 F. Whether or not CLC is successful in acquiring a Priority Property, the process that commences with an owner's expression of interest in selling an interest in its Priority Property to CLC and ends (if acquired) with the City's receipt of title or a Landowner Conservation Easement, as appropriate, and CLC's receipt of a City Conservation Easement or City Stewardship Assignment, as appropriate, is referred to herein as an "Acquisition Project." If a Priority Property is not acquired, an Acquisition Project ends when CLC sends written notice to the City that the Priority Property cannot be acquired or the City sends CLC written notice that the City declines to proceed with that acquisition. If the City, through the process outlined below, declines to proceed with acquisition of a Priority Property, CLC may proceed, at its sole expense and on its own behalf and not on behalf of the parties, with acquisition of that Priority Property.

 G. For each Acquisition Project, the sequence and schedule of activities, each of which must be completed before the next is undertaken, shall be as follows:

 i) Within 15 working days after the Effective Date, CLC shall send a letter of introduction to the owner of each Priority Property and follow up with a personal contact to see if the owner is interested in pursuing a possible sale of an interest in its Priority Property to CLC. For each owner that does not respond within 10 days to the letter of introduction, CLC shall promptly send a second letter. As CLC receives expressions of landowner interest, CLC shall allocate half the Acquisition Projects to OSR; provided, with the prior written consent of the City, such allocation may be changed.

 ii) CLC shall enter into a Letter of Intent with a willing landowner.

 iii) Using an MAI appraiser approved by the City, CLC shall obtain an appraisal establishing the fair market value of the fee or Landowner Conservation Easement interest in the Priority Property, as appropriate, assuming highest and best use. If the Letter of Intent contemplates sale of the property in fee simple, the appraisal shall determine the difference between (a) the present value of the property subject to a perpetual easement to protect Fish Habitat and (b) the present value of such property subject to an easement to protect Fish Habitat terminating on December 31, 2050. In determining the values described in clauses (a) and (b) above, the appraiser shall use a discount rate of 4.5%. The difference between the two present values shall be the CLC Portion, which shall be paid by CLC at the closing of the acquisition of the Priority Property, if CLC desires to obtain a perpetual, rather than term, City Conservation Easement.

 iv) CLC shall make an offer, provided that CLC shall obtain the written approval of the City before making an offer (a) if the appraised value is more than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) or (b) if the Priority Property contains a structure, building, paved road, or formally approved trail.

 v) CLC shall negotiate a Purchase and Sale Agreement. Before entering into the negotiated Purchase and Sale Agreement, CLC shall, within 5 working days of negotiating the Purchase and Sale Agreement, provide the City with a copy of the proposed Purchase and Sale Agreement for its approval.

 vi) Within 5 working days of receiving the proposed Purchase and Sale Agreement from CLC, the City shall send, by electronic mail its approval or disapproval of the Purchase and Sale Agreement to CLC.

 vii) Within 30 working days of the effective date of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, CLC shall commission and review a property title report and Environmental Assessment(s) with companies approved by the City, shall complete such other due diligence tasks necessary to decide whether or not to remove Buyer's Feasibility Contingency under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and provide written notice to the City, in the form of Exhibit E hereto, containing CLC's conclusions with respect to due diligence tasks, the Environmental Assessment, title report and other documents developed or obtained by CLC, and CLC's recommendation on whether or not to proceed with acquisition of the Priority Property ("Notice of Feasibility").

 For any Acquisition Project in which the Phase 1 Environmental Assessment recommends a Phase 2 Assessment, CLC shall, within five (5) working days of receipt of the Phase 1 Assessment, make a recommendation to the City regarding whether to continue with the Acquisition Project and complete a Phase 2 Assessment, or terminate the Acquisition Project. The City shall, within five (5) working days of receiving CLC's recommendation, provide written direction to CLC whether to proceed with or terminate the Acquisition Project; provided, that, for Acquisition Projects where CLC recommends proceeding with the Acquisition Project, the City shall be deemed to have approved proceeding with the Acquisition Project unless the City, in writing, disapproves or provides conditions within the time period established by this section. If the City directs CLC to proceed with the Acquisition Project, and if necessary under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, CLC shall make a diligent effort to extend the Buyer's Feasibility Contingency period under the Purchase and Sale Agreement in order to conduct a Phase 2 Environmental Assessment. As used in this Agreement, "Environmental Assessment" means, collectively, an evaluation commonly known as and consistent with federal guidelines regarding "Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessments" and, if so indicated by the Phase 1 assessment, a "Phase 2 Environmental Site Assessment," as well as any additional environmental evaluation CLC deems necessary.

 viii) Within 10 working days of receipt of the Notice of Feasibility and accompanying documents, the City shall approve, disapprove or provide any conditions to removing the Buyer's Feasibility Contingency and proceeding with the Acquisition Project, provided that the City shall be deemed to have approved CLC's removal of Buyer's Feasibility Contingency and proceeding with the Acquisition Project unless the City, in writing, disapproves or provides conditions within the time period established by this section. CLC shall pay into escrow the amount due on the earnest money promissory note upon the removal of Buyer's Feasibility Contingency, in accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

 ix) Within 15 working days of the removal of Buyer's Feasibility Contingency under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, CLC shall prepare the Present Conditions Report (as defined below) and other closing documents listed in Exhibit F hereto (the "Notice of Assignment") and provide the Notice of Assignment, and accompanying documents, to the City for review and approval.

 x) Within 10 working days of receipt of the Notice of Assignment, and accompanying documents, the City shall, in writing, approve, disapprove or request reasonable modifications to the Present Conditions Report and closing documents.

 In the event the City requests modifications to the Present Conditions Report or the draft closing documents, the Parties shall confer and attempt to accommodate such requests within five (5) working days.

 xi) No less than 10 working days prior to the date set for closing in the Notice of Assignment, the City and CLC shall execute the PSA Assignment and final closing documents and proceed to closing.

 Each Acquisition Project shall be conducted pursuant to all applicable Federal, State and local laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, an Acquisition Project shall terminate if the City denies approval when it has been requested pursuant to this subsection H or if the Parties cannot agree on the documents described in clause ix) above.

 H. For each Acquisition Project, CLC shall maintain communication with the landowner and shall document all landowner contacts through a contact log.

 I. CLC shall deliver to the City on each Acquisition Project, according to the schedule established in Section 2.G above, a report documenting the relevant features, current uses and state of improvement on each Priority Property, including the Fish Habitat ("Present Conditions Report").

 K. Each Acquisition Project shall be funded and closed in accordance with Sections 3 and 4 hereof.

 Section 3. Funding of Acquisition Projects A. For each Acquisition Project, whether or not a fee interest or conservation easement in a Priority Property actually is acquired, the City shall pay the total Acquisition Costs (as defined below) actually incurred by CLC for the Acquisition Project, provided, that the City's obligation to pay non-purchase price Acquisition Costs shall be limited in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided further, that the City's total monetary obligation for all Acquisition Costs (including without limitation Purchase Price) shall not exceed $3,000,000, unless the City requests the increase of such amount in writing.

 B. For each Acquisition Project, "Acquisition Costs" means:

 (i) The Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement) for the Acquired Property or Acquired Easement Property, as applicable, which Purchase Price (minus the Earnest Money Deposit already paid by CLC) the City shall pay through escrow to the Seller of the Priority Property;

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the City assumes no obligation for costs related to a Priority Property that are incurred subsequent to the City's written disapproval of an Acquisition Project pursuant to Sections 2.F or 2.G hereof. If CLC decides to acquire a Priority Property after the City has declined to do so, the City shall have no obligation for the purchase price or any costs incurred by CLC with respect to that Priority Property subsequent to the City's written disapproval.

 D. CLC and the City agree that for each Acquisition Project that closes, the parties shall make the following payments into escrow: (i) in accordance with the terms of the PSA Assignment and this Agreement, the City shall pay the Acquisition Costs, provided that the component costs have been documented to the reasonable satisfaction of the City and (ii) CLC shall pay the CLC Portion, but only in connection with acquisition of an Acquired Property.

CLC and the City agree that for each Acquisition Project that involves CLC Immediate Property Management Action Costs, such costs shall be paid to CLC as provided for in Section 4.B.

 G. The City will pay a portion of the legal costs that CLC has incurred in developing this Agreement, as follows: within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the City will pay CLC Twenty-Four Thousand Dollars ($24,000), representing approximately seventy-five percent of such legal costs through May 31, 2005; provided that on or prior to the Effective Date the City has received reasonable documentation of such costs.

In accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2, the City shall either (i) grant and convey to CLC a City Conservation Easement (either perpetual or expiring on December 31, 2050) for each Acquired Property restricting the uses of the Acquired Property to uses that are consistent with preserving and protecting Fish Habitat and requiring specified monitoring and management actions on the Acquired Property, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto with the property-specific information inserted, and with such other changes as may be agreed to by the Parties, or (ii) deliver to CLC an executed City Stewardship Assignment under a Landowner Conservation Easement for each Acquired Easement Property (continuing in effect for so long as the City holds the Landowner Conservation Easement), authorizing CLC to monitor the City's rights thereunder, and requiring CLC to exercise specified management actions thereunder, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto with the property-specific information inserted, and with such other changes as may be agreed to by the Parties. CLC and the City shall manage and maintain each Acquired Property and Acquired Easement Property in accordance with the applicable City Conservation Easement or Landowner Conservation Easement and City Stewardship Assignment, as appropriate, and all applicable Federal, State and local laws.

 B. CLC and the City agree that the annual cost of monitoring, maintenance and stewardship for each Acquired Property or Acquired Easement Property through December 31, 2050 shall be $3,000 (in 2005 dollars), prorated for a portion of a year and adjusted for inflation by use of the Consumer Price Index or, when such index is unavailable, by use of recent Consumer Price Indices. Examples of inflation adjustments are shown in Schedule 1 hereto. No later than December 31 of each year of the term of this Agreement (but in no event later than December 31, 2050), CLC shall send the City an invoice, documented to the City's reasonable satisfaction, for monitoring, maintenance and stewardship of all Acquired Properties and Acquired Easement Properties, and the City shall pay such invoice within 30 days of receipt of such invoice. Beginning January 1, 2051, the City no longer shall pay any portion of the monitoring, maintenance and stewardship fees specified in this Section 5.B, but for so long as the City owns an Acquired Property or holds a Landowner Conservation Easement on an Acquired Easement Property, CLC shall continue to provide monitoring, maintenance and stewardship of such property in accordance with the City Conservation Easement or the City Stewardship Assignment, as applicable. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, on and after January 1, 2051, Grantee in its sole discretion may release the City Conservation Easement and terminate the City Stewardship Assignment, thereby terminating Grantee's obligations thereunder, by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice of same to Grantor. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this section 5 and those of the City Conservation Easement or City Stewardship Assignment, the latter documents shall control.

 Section 6. Reporting

 A. Quarterly Acquisition Reports. Until all Acquisition Projects have terminated, CLC shall report to the City within thirty (30) days of the end of each March, June, September and December. The report shall contain the following information: (i) the status of Acquisition Project activities relating to each Priority Property listed in Exhibit A that has not been acquired as of the date of the report, including dates and nature of contacts made with landowners and/or their representatives, and Acquisition Costs incurred to date; (ii) total Acquisition Costs and CLC Immediate Management Actions Costs on all Acquisition Projects completed to date; and (iii) other relevant information requested by the City for the purpose of determining compliance with this Agreement.

 B. Final Report. Within ninety (90) days following the earlier of a) expiration of the acquisition phase provided for under Section 2.A hereof or b) termination of this Agreement, CLC shall provide the City with a final report that summarizes the information provided in the quarterly acquisition reports.

 C. Land Management Reports. No later than December 31 of each year during the term of this Agreement, CLC shall provide the City with a report, as described in the City Conservation Easements and City Stewardship Assignments, summarizing its activities during the previous year in managing the Acquired

 Properties and Acquired Easement Properties.

 Section 7. Hold Harmless and Indemnification

 A. The City assumes no responsibility for the payment of any compensation, fees, wages, benefits or taxes to or on behalf of CLC, its employees, contractors or others by reason of this Agreement. CLC shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the City, its officers, agents and employees from any and all claims, cost and liabilities whatsoever occurring or resulting from: (i) CLC's failure to pay any compensation, fees, wages, benefits or taxes and (ii) the supplying to CLC or the City of work, services, materials or supplies by CLC employees or agents or other contractors or suppliers in connection with or in support of performance of this Agreement.

 B. CLC shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the City and its officers, employees, agents and contractors, and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liabilities, penalties, losses, costs, damages, claims, causes of action, demands or judgments, or awards of damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in any way connected with a breach of this Agreement by

 CLC, its officers, agents or employees, negligent action or inaction of CLC, its officers, agents or employees in the acquisition or stewardship of Priority Properties, or their failure to comply with all applicable laws. For purpose of this Agreement only, CLC waives the immunity granted it for industrial insurance claims pursuant to Revised Code of Washington Chapter 51 to the extent necessary to extend its obligations under this section to any claim, demand, or cause of action brought by or on behalf of any employee of CLC, including judgments, awards and costs arising therefrom and including attorney's fees. The parties acknowledge that these provisions were specifically negotiated and agreed upon by them.

 WHEREAS, Grantor and Grantee make the following recitals:

 A. As a party to the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan dated April 21, 2000, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time ("HCP"), Grantor made a commitment to spend specified amounts of money to acquire, restore, enhance and/or protect high quality

 B. To implement its obligations under the HCP, Grantor has entered into that certain Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat dated as of ____________, 200_ (the "Agreement") with Grantee.

 C. In accordance with the Agreement and with the assistance of Grantee, Grantor has acquired an approximately __ acre parcel of land in King County, Washington, as legally described in Appendix A (the "Protected Property") and depicted in Appendix B, both attached hereto and incorporated herein, for the preservation, and possible restoration and/or enhancement, of Fish Habitat.

 D. The nature of Fish Habitat on the Protected Property is documented in a present conditions report, prepared by Grantee, that provides an inventory of the relevant features, current uses and state of improvement of the Protected Property (the "Report"). Grantor has been or will be provided a copy of the Report.

 E. In accordance with the Agreement, Grantee is obligated to manage the Protected Property until [the expiration of the HCP on December 31, 2050 ] [any termination or release as provided for in section 8 or extinguishment as provided for in section 12] to (i) preserve Fish Habitat and (ii) restore or enhance Fish Habitat (as set forth in this Easement and the Report, and as may be set forth in writing by Grantor in the future), and Grantor in facilitation thereof is granting to Grantee a [temporary] [perpetual] conservation- stewardship easement in the Protected Property (as hereinafter defined, the "Easement").

 [F. To accomplish perpetual preservation in accordance with the Agreement, Grantee has paid to Grantee $____________, the difference between the present value of the Protected Property subject to this perpetual conservation-stewardship easement and the present value of the Protected Property subject to a conservation-stewardship easement terminating on December 31, 2050 (the "CLC Portion").]

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual covenants, terms, conditions and restrictions contained herein and in the Agreement, Grantor and Grantee agree as follows:

However, at the request of Grantor, Grantee shall execute a release of easement that may be recorded.] Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Easement may be terminated or released sooner in accordance with section 8. The conveyance of this Easement is a conveyance of an interest in real property under the provisions of RCW 64.04.130, subject only to the

 C. Maintenance of Property and Conservation Values. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3, and provided that the following actions on or uses of the Protected Property do not interfere with Fish Habitat, Grantor may:

 1. Control or remove for ecological purposes non-native or invasive plant and animal species using, if necessary, insecticides, herbicides or other biocides.

 2. Alter existing topography or hydrology in order to protect, maintain, enhance or restore Fish Habitat or make any improvements to the Protected Property directly related to maintaining or restoring Fish Habitat; provided, that prior to applying for governmental permits for each such project, Grantor has consulted with Grantee.

 3. Alter existing vegetation in order to protect, maintain, enhance or restore Fish Habitat.

 4. Remove or trim hazardous trees that present a clear and imminent danger to public health or safety.

 5. Install or maintain gates, barriers, and directional or interpretive signage to allow the public access permitted by this Easement.

 6. Maintain, reconstruct, relocate or eliminate existing footpaths to allow public access as permitted by Section 4.B of this Easement.

 7. Install, maintain, construct and use with motorized vehicles temporary access routes necessary to accomplish the activities allowed by this Section 4; provided that this Section shall not be interpreted or construed to permit public access by motorized vehicles. Such access routes shall be the minimum width and length necessary to accommodate vehicles and materials. Where reasonably feasible, use of hand-operated equipment and foot access shall be utilized. Any such access route shall be sited to avoid or minimize interference with Fish Habitat, and shall be removed with the area restored to its prior natural condition upon project completion.

 The provisos in this Section 4.C that prohibit uses or activities in this Easement that "interfere with Fish Habitat" are not intended to prohibit uses or activities that have a de minimis impact on Fish Habitat on the Protected Property.

 D. Protection of Health and Safety. The right to undertake other activities necessary to protect public health or safety, including the use of motorized vehicles in emergency situations, or which are actively required by and subject to compulsion of any government agency with authority to require such activity; provided, that Grantor shall make diligent efforts to avoid or minimize interference with Fish Habitat and, to the extent reasonably feasible, the area shall be restored to its prior natural condition upon project completion.

 E. Development Rights. The right to use any development rights that are now or hereafter allocated to, implied, reserved or inherent in the Protected Property for the purpose of calculating permissible lot yield or density, or to meet setback, density or open space requirements for development, of any property other than the Protected Property.

 5. Responsibilities of Grantor

 A. Annual Payment. Until January 1, 2051, the Grantor shall pay Grantee $3,000 per year (in 2005 dollars) (the "Annual Payment") for its maintenance and stewardship responsibilities with respect to the Protected Property, as those responsibilities are set forth in Section 6 hereof. Of the Annual Payment, $2,250 shall be used by Grantee for Monitoring and General Maintenance of the Protected Property (as described in sections 6.A.1 and 6.A.2) and $750 shall be used for the General Stewardship, as described in Section 6.A.3, of all properties on which Grantee has obtained conservation-stewardship easements or stewardship assignments under the Agreement (the "Protected Properties"). In the event that Grantee is able to provide Monitoring and General Maintenance of the Protected Property for less than $2,250 in a given year, Grantee shall increase the work to be performed and Grantee's expenditure for General Stewardship of the Protected Properties in the amount equaling the under-expenditure for Monitoring and General Maintenance of the Protected Property. In the event that the Monitoring and General Maintenance required under Section 6 for the Protected Property in a given year costs more than $2,250, Grantee shall be responsible for such additional costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that unforeseeable circumstances occur Grantee may request modification of its responsibilities under Section 6 and/or an increased Annual Payment, and Grantor, at its sole discretion, will determine whether to grant such request.

 The Annual Payment shall be prorated for a portion of a year

 and adjusted for inflation by use of the Consumer Price Index or, when such index is unavailable, by use of recent Consumer Price

 Indices. Examples of inflation adjustments are shown in Schedule 1 hereto. Between December 1 and December 31 of each year through 2050, Grantee shall send Grantor an invoice for the Annual Payment, documenting to Grantor's reasonable satisfaction the Monitoring and General Maintenance performed on the Protected Property and the General Stewardship performed on the Protected Properties during that calendar year. Grantor shall pay such invoice within 30 days of receipt.

 B. End of Annual Payment. Beginning on January 1, 2051 and continuing thereafter, Grantor no longer shall pay for maintenance and stewardship, but Grantee shall continue to provide all such services to the Protected Property in accordance with section 6 hereof for so long as the City of Seattle owns the Protected Property. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, on and after January 1, 2051, Grantee in its sole discretion may, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Grantor, terminate its obligations in accordance with section 8.B. Other than as specified herein, this Easement is not intended to in any way affect any obligation of the Grantor as owner of the Protected Property, including, without limitation, the payment of all taxes and assessments and compliance with applicable laws.

 6. Rights and Responsibilities of Grantee

 To accomplish the Purpose of this Easement, Grantee shall have:

 A. The responsibility for the general upkeep and maintenance of the Protected Property, consistent with the uses and activities reserved to Grantor under Sections 4.C and D of this Easement. General upkeep and maintenance entails the following:

 1. Monitoring: Conducting regular monitoring of the Protected Property depending on activity level (minimum of one visit per calendar quarter) to check for dumping and other illegal activity, to evaluate compliance with terms of the Easement and to implement the general maintenance and ecological stewardship tasks described below.

 2. General Maintenance:

 a) Maintaining appropriate perimeter postings, such as those relating to trespassing, hunting and public access generally;

 b) Maintaining any fences, gates or barriers intended to keep motorized vehicles off the Protected Property in a condition substantially similar to their condition as of the date of this Easement;

 c) Removing garbage, closing trails, revegetating informal trails or otherwise taking reasonable measures to protect Fish Habitat in response to unauthorized uses of the Protected Property by third parties other than Grantor; and

 d) Advising Grantor of any known conditions (e.g., hazardous trees, illegal activity or trespass, vandalism) that present a clear and imminent danger to public health or safety.

 3. General Stewardship:

 a) Routine ecological stewardship : Providing stewardship services to retain and improve levels of biodiversity on the Protected Property. Grantee will conduct at least three (3) stewardship events per year on the Protected Property; provided, however, that this affirmative obligation on the Protected Property shall be deemed to be met by Grantee if Grantee has otherwise provided for the year in question at least three (3) stewardship events on each of seven (7) other Protected Properties. Each stewardship event involving volunteers shall use a minimum of fifteen (15) Conservation Corps or volunteer workers for a minimum of six (6) hours (not including transportation time). Each stewardship event using solely Conservation Corps workers shall use a minimum of six (6) workers for a minimum of six (6) hours (not including transportation time). Grantee, in consultation with Grantor, will determine whether to use volunteer or skilled labor or some combination of the two, based upon the appropriate skill level required, safety considerations, technical skill requirements, and efficacy in carrying out the required work tasks. Stewardship events for invasive weed removal shall occur during the months of February , July and September of the same year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. Typical routine maintenance activities include:

 i) Controlling noxious weeds, invasive species and pests as required by applicable law; and

 ii) Planting of native vegetation.

 b) Capital Projects: Grantee will provide fund development and project planning for capital projects on the Protected Property. Grantee will oversee implementation of any funded projects; staff time to be paid through grants. Grantee will have primary responsibility of prioritizing and identifying the project site and activities (with guidance from and upon mutual agreement with Grantor), developing matching funds, and overseeing implementation. Capital projects shall be approved by Grantor in writing prior to implementation. Typical capital projects include:

 i. Erosion control;

 ii. Bank stabilization using live-stake techniques; and/or

 iii. Installation of large woody debris.

 c) Grantor and Grantee shall meet at least annually prior to the growing season to plan for Grantee activities including General Stewardship activities on the Protected Property and the other Protected Properties. Grantor and Grantee shall endeavor to be as efficient as possible in allocating the General Stewardship portion of the Annual Payment among the above-described General Stewardship activities and across all Protected Properties. The parties recognize that the stewardship needs of the Protected Properties may be unequal and, therefore, the expenditure of money for such activities on the Protected Property in a given year may be

 zero or less than the amount spent on other Protected Properties. If Grantor and Grantee disagree on the aforesaid plan, Grantor's plan shall be adopted; provided, that Grantee shall be under no obligation to expend more effort on General Stewardship activities on the Protected Property and all other Protected Properties in a given year than the General Stewardship portion of the anticipated Annual Payments. Grantee shall inform Grantor of each of the General Stewardship events and activities scheduled on the Protected Property at least two weeks prior to its occurrence.

 4. Specific Stewardship Actions: Implementing those stewardship elements (which may include demolition and removal of improvements existing as of the date of this Easement) specifically called out in the Report and agreed to by Grantor; provided, that Grantee shall have no right to any payment from Grantor for such actions without the prior written approval of Grantor, nor shall any portion of the Annual Payment be spent on Specific Stewardship Actions.

 B. The right to enter upon the Protected Property at reasonable times in order to undertake Grantee's management responsibilities and to monitor Grantor's compliance with and otherwise enforce the terms of this Easement in accordance with Section 7, all in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Grantor's quiet use and enjoyment of the Property;

 C. In the event that the Fish Habitat is impaired by an Act of God, the right to restore all or portions of the Protected Property in ways not inconsistent with the Purpose of the Easement and upon mutual agreement with Grantor;

 D. The right to prevent any activity on or use of the Protected Property that is inconsistent with the Purpose of this Easement and to require Grantor's restoration of such areas or features of the Protected Property that may be damaged by any inconsistent activity or use, pursuant to Section 7; and

 E. The right to undertake such restoration and enhancement of the Protected Property as provided for in a restoration agreement mutually agreed upon by Grantor and Grantee.

 F. No later than December 31 of each year for so long as Grantee has management and stewardship responsibilities under this Easement with respect to the Protected Property, the responsibility to provide Grantor with a report that summarizes such Grantee activities during the previous year. The report shall indicate the nature of habitat

 improvements, structures, trails or other unauthorized man-made improvements, or potential threats to Fish Habitat, actions taken to preserve Fish Habitat, other general maintenance or general stewardship activities (including fund development for capital projects) required by or otherwise consistent with this Easement, and other relevant information that may be requested by Grantor.

 In fulfilling its responsibilities hereunder, Grantee shall not be deemed to be an employee of Grantee, nor shall Grantee be authorized to act as the agent or legal representative of the City for any purpose whatsoever. Grantee is not granted any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of or in the name of Grantor or to bind Grantor in any manner or thing whatsoever. Other than as specified herein, this Easement is not intended to impose any legal or other responsibility on Grantee.

 7. Enforcement

 A. Grantee. Grantee shall have the right to prevent and correct violations of the terms of this Easement, as follows: With reasonable advance notice to Grantor, Grantee may enter the Protected Property for the purpose of inspecting for violations. If Grantee finds what it believes is a violation, Grantee, before proceeding to informal dispute resolution as described in Section 7.C, shall give Grantor written notice of the violation and thirty (30) days to correct it, or, under circumstances where the violation cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, such longer time as is reasonably necessary, provided that Grantor has begun curing the violation within such thirty (30) day period and is proceeding diligently to cure the violation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall not be a cure period when an ongoing or imminent violation could significantly diminish or impair the Fish Habitat on the Protected Property.

 B. Grantor. Grantor shall have the right to compel Grantee's performance of its responsibilities under the terms of this Easement, or to terminate this Easement in the event of continued nonperformance by Grantee, as follows: If Grantor determines that Grantee is not diligently performing its responsibilities under this

 Easement or is otherwise in violation of the terms of this Easement, Grantor, before proceeding to informal dispute resolution as described in Section 7.C, shall give Grantee written notice of the nonperformance or violation and thirty (30) days to correct it, or, under circumstances where the nonperformance or violation cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, such longer time as is reasonably necessary, provided that Grantee has begun curing the nonperformance or violation within such thirty (30) day period and is proceeding diligently to cure the nonperformance or violation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall not be a cure period when an ongoing or imminent violation could significantly diminish or impair the Fish Habitat on the Protected Property.

 Grantor shall also have the right to the timely and reasonable consent of the Grantee when appropriate under this Easement. If Grantor believes that consent has not been given reasonably, Grantor shall (except in a situation that could irreversibly diminish or impair the Fish Habitat on the Protected Property) give Grantee written notice and thirty (30) days for consent before proceeding to informal dispute resolution as described in Section 7.C. Upon the failure of informal dispute resolution, Grantor may seek an injunction or any other process to mandate Grantee's consent. If, after all appeals have been exhausted or appeals periods have run, a court of competent jurisdiction finds that consent was unreasonably withheld, consent shall be deemed to be given.

 C. Informal Dispute Resolution. If the cure period described in Section 7.A or 7.B, as applicable, has run and a cure not effectuated, or if there is no cure period, Grantor's HCP Program Manager and Grantee's King County Senior Conservation Director shall negotiate in good faith and use their best efforts to resolve the dispute. If Grantor and Grantee cannot resolve the dispute, it shall be referred to Grantor's Resource Planning Branch Executive, Seattle Public Utilities, and Grantee's President, or their successors. Only upon failure to resolve the dispute through the foregoing process may Grantor or Grantee pursue the remedies set forth in Sections 7.D or 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in a situation that could significantly diminish or impair the Fish Habitat on the Protected Property, either Party may proceed immediately to the remedies set forth in Sections 7.D or 8.

 D. Remedies. Either Party may bring an action at law or in equity to enforce the terms of this Easement, by seeking to enjoin the violation temporarily or permanently, to require restoration of the Protected Property to its condition prior to the injury and/or to recover any damages to which that Party may be entitled, as applicable. In addition, in the event that Grantee's nonperformance of its responsibilities under, or violation of, the terms of this Easement is not resolved through informal dispute resolution, Grantor may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Easement. Upon Grantor's request, Grantee shall execute a document evidencing such termination and Grantor may record it. The failure of either Party to discover a violation or to take immediate legal action shall not bar it from doing so at a later time, provided that each Party must act with reasonable promptness upon discovery to correct any claimed violation. Nothing herein shall limit the Parties' other remedies.

 8. Termination and Release

 A. Automatic Termination. Notwithstanding any provision of this Easement to the contrary, if at any time (1) Grantee, at its sole discretion, determines that it has become impractical for Grantee to undertake its rights and/or responsibilities under this Easement and Grantee has given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Grantor, (2) Grantee ceases to exist or to be authorized to acquire and hold conservation easements under RCW 64.04.130 and 84.34.210 (or any successor provision(s) then applicable), (3) bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are commenced against Grantee, (4) the Agreement has been terminated for any reason by Grantee, in accordance with its terms, or (5) the procedures described in Section 7 have been followed, and Grantor and Grantee have been unable to resolve a dispute about Grantee's fulfillment of its obligations under this Easement, then this Easement and Grantee's rights and responsibilities hereunder shall terminate automatically upon Grantor's notice of same to Grantee. Upon request, Grantee shall execute such documents as Grantor reasonably requests to evidence such termination.

 B. Optional Termination. If Grantor terminates the Agreement, Grantor may leave this Easement in effect or, in Grantor's sole discretion, require its termination. [Termination shall be effective upon notice from the City.] [Termination shall be effective upon the City's reimbursement of the CLC Portion with interest at the rate of 4.5% per annum.] In addition, on and after January 1, 2051, Grantee in its sole discretion may release this Easement by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice of same to Grantor. In such event, the Parties shall execute and record a release of this Easement.

 9. Transfer of Protected Property

 Any time that this Easement, the Protected Property itself, or any interest in it is to be transferred by Grantee or Grantor to a third party, the transferring Party, its successors and assigns, shall give written notice to the other Party at least thirty (30) days prior to transfer, such notice containing the name, address and telephone number of the prospective transferee or its representative, and, in the case of Grantee, shall obtain prior written approval from Grantor for the assignment, which approval may be granted or denied in Grantor's sole discretion. In addition, the executory contract for the transfer of any interest in all or a portion of the Protected Property shall describe this Easement, and the document by which Grantor divests itself of such interest shall incorporate the terms of this Easement directly or by reference.

 10. Estoppel Certificates

 Upon request by Grantor, Grantee shall within thirty (30) days execute and deliver to Grantor any document, including an estoppel certificate, which certifies, to the knowledge of Grantee whether or not Grantor is in compliance with all obligations of Grantor contained in this Easement, provided that any such document shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Grantee. Such certification shall be limited to the condition of the Protected Property as of Grantee's most recent inspection. If Grantor requests more current documentation, Grantee shall conduct an inspection, at Grantor's expense, within sixty (60) days of receipt of Grantor's written request therefor.

 11. Liability and Indemnification

 A. Grantor assumes no responsibility for the payment of any compensation, fees, wages, benefits or taxes to or on behalf of Grantee, its employees, contractors or others by reason of this Easement. Grantee shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless Grantor, its officers, agents and employees from any and all claims,

 cost and liabilities whatsoever occurring or resulting from: (a) Grantee's failure to pay any compensation, fees, wages, benefits or taxes; and (ii) the supplying to Grantee or Grantor of work, services, materials or supplies by Grantee's employees or agents or

 other contractors or suppliers in connection with or in support of performance of Grantee's obligations under this Easement.

 B. Grantee shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless Grantor and its officers, employees, agents and contractors, and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liabilities, penalties, losses, costs, damages, claims, causes of action, demands or judgments, or awards of damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in any way connected with a breach of this Easement by Grantee, its officers, agents or employees, negligent action or inaction of Grantee, its officers, agents or employees in the acquisition or stewardship of Priority Properties, or their failure to comply with all applicable laws. For purpose of this Easement only, Grantee waives the immunity granted it for industrial insurance claims pursuant to Revised Code of Washington Chapter 51 to the extent necessary to extend its obligations under this section to any claim, demand, or cause of action brought by or on behalf of any employee of Grantee, including judgments, awards and costs arising therefrom and including attorney's fees. The parties acknowledge that these provisions were specifically negotiated and agreed upon by them.

 12. Extinguishment and Eminent Domain

 A. Extinguishment. If circumstances arise in the future that render the Purpose of this Easement impossible to accomplish, this Easement can only be terminated or extinguished, whether in whole or in part, by joint agreement of the Parties or by judicial proceedings in a court having jurisdiction. Grantee shall have no compensable interest in the Easement under such circumstances. The immediately foregoing provision shall be limited solely to the circumstances in this Section 11.A, and shall not be interpreted to have any application or inference to any other provision of, or circumstance under, this Easement, including, but not limited to, those provisions pertaining to enforcement of the terms of this Easement.

 B. Condemnation. If all or any of the Protected Property is taken by exercise of the power of eminent domain or acquired by purchase in lieu of condemnation, whether by public, corporate, or other authority, so as to terminate this Easement, in whole or in part, Grantor and Grantee shall act jointly to recover the full value of the interest in the Protected Property subject to the taking or in lieu purchase and all direct or incidental damages resulting from the taking or in lieu purchase. All expenses reasonably incurred by Grantor and Grantee in connection with the taking or in lieu purchase shall be paid out of the amount recovered. Upon payment of any expenses reasonably incurred by Grantee, Grantee shall not be entitled to compensation and the entirety of any compensation award shall belong to Grantor. The immediately foregoing provision shall be limited solely to the circumstances described in this Section 11.B, and shall not be interpreted to have any application or inference to any other provision of, or circumstance under, this Easement, including, but not limited to, those provisions pertaining to enforcements of the terms of this Easement.

 13. Modification

 This Easement may be modified by agreement of the parties provided that any such amendment shall be consistent with the Purpose of this Easement and shall not affect its duration. All modifications shall be in writing, signed by both parties and recorded in the real property records of King County.

 14. Interpretation

 This Easement shall be interpreted under the laws of Washington, resolving any ambiguities and questions of the validity of specific provisions so as to give maximum effect to its conservation purposes. Grantor and Grantee and their counsel have reviewed this Easement and agree that the normal rules of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Easement. In the event of any conflict between the legal description in Appendix A and the map contained in Appendix B, the legal description shall control. All recitals and Appendices hereto are by this reference incorporated into this Easement. This Easement may be executed in counterparts, and all such counterparts shall be part of one document.

 GRANT DEED OF CONSERVATION EASEMENT

 THIS GRANT DEED OF CONSERVATION EASEMENT (the "Easement") is granted this ____ day of ___________, 200_, by _______________________, _________________________ ("Grantor") to The

 City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantee").

 I. RECITALS

 WHEREAS, Grantor and Grantee make the following recitals:

 A. Grantor is the sole owner in fee simple of that certain real property located at _______________ in King County, Washington, which is legally described in Appendix A hereto (the "Property").

 B. [The Property includes a residential area as of the date of grant of this Easement described as follows: ___________________ as generally shown on Appendix B hereto (the "Residential Zone"). Within the Residential Zone as of the date of grant of this Easement are _________________________. Grantee acknowledges that this listing of the improvements existing on the Property as of the date of grant of this Easement is intended for reference purposes only and does not limit in any way additions or alterations to these improvements allowable under this Easement.]

 C. [The remaining] approximately __ acres of the Property, shown on Appendix B as the "Fish Habitat Zone," is a natural area containing high quality spawning, rearing or refuge habitat for anadromous fish species, and the natural features and processes sustaining such habitat ("Fish Habitat" ).

 D. Specific features of the Fish Habitat Zone are documented in an inventory to be maintained on file at the offices of Grantee and incorporated into this Easement by this reference ("Present Conditions Report"). The Present Conditions Report, consisting of reports, maps, photographs, and other documentation, provides an accurate representation of the Property and Fish Habitat Zone at the date of grant of this Easement and is intended to serve as an objective information baseline for monitoring compliance with the terms of this Easement. As shown in Appendix E hereto, the Present Conditions Report has been reviewed and accepted by both Grantor and Grantee.

 E. Grantor, as owner of the Property, has the right to identify, protect, and preserve the Fish Habitat Zone in perpetuity, and desires to transfer such rights to Grantee in perpetuity.

 F. In fulfillment of certain of its obligations under the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan dated April 21, 2000 ("HCP"), as may be amended from time to time, Grantee desires to acquire a conservation easement in the Fish Habitat Zone.

 II. GRANT

 A. For the reasons stated above, and in consideration of $10.00 and other good and valuable consideration in hand paid, Grantor hereby grants, conveys and warrants to Grantee, and Grantee accepts, as permitted by Revised Code of Washington ("RCW") 64.04.130 and Ch. 84.34 RCW, a conservation easement (the "Easement") in perpetuity over the Property, subject only to the mutual covenants, terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Easement and to those encumbrances set forth in Appendix C hereto ("Permitted Title Exceptions").

 B. This Easement is an interest in real property under the provisions of RCW 64.04.130.

 C. Grantor expressly intends that this Easement run with the land and that this Easement shall be binding upon Grantor's personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns.

 III. PURPOSE

 The purpose of this Easement is to implement the mutual intentions of Grantor and Grantee as expressed in the above Recitals and in the provisions that follow, to assure that the Fish Habitat Zone will be retained forever in its natural condition, and to prevent any use of, or activity on, the Property that will impair or interfere with the Fish Habitat therein (the "Purpose"). Grantor and Grantee intend that this Easement will confine the use of, or activity on, the Property to those uses and activities consistent with this Purpose.

 IV. GRANTEE'S RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

 To accomplish the Purpose of this Easement, the following rights are conveyed to Grantee by this Easement:

 A. Identification, Protection, Restoration and Enhancement. The right to identify, preserve, restore, enhance and protect in perpetuity the Fish Habitat in the Fish Habitat Zone. Grantee may:

 1. Control or remove for ecological purposes non-native or invasive plant and animal species in the Fish Habitat Zone using, if necessary, insecticides, herbicides or other biocides, provided such application is by the narrowest spectrum, least persistent material appropriate for the target species.

 2. Alter existing topography or hydrology in the Fish Habitat

 Zone in order to protect, maintain, enhance or restore Fish Habitat or make any improvements to the Fish Habitat Zone directly related to maintaining or restoring Fish Habitat.

 3. Alter existing vegetation on the Fish Habitat Zone in order to protect, maintain, enhance or restore Fish Habitat.

 4. Install, maintain, construct and use with motorized vehicles temporary access routes across the Property and in the Fish Habitat Zone necessary to accomplish the activities allowed by this Section IV; provided that this Section shall not be interpreted or construed to permit public access by motorized vehicles. Such access routes shall be the minimum width and length necessary to accommodate vehicles and materials. Where reasonably feasible, use of hand- operated equipment and foot access shall be utilized.

The purpose of requiring Grantor to notify Grantee prior to undertaking these permitted uses and activities is to afford Grantee an opportunity to ensure that the use or activity in question is designed and carried out in a manner consistent with the Purpose of this Easement. Whenever such notice is required, Grantor shall notify Grantee in writing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date Grantor intends to undertake the use or activity in question. The notice shall describe the nature, scope, design, location, timetable, and any other material aspect of the proposed use or activity in sufficient detail to permit Grantee to make an informed judgment as to its consistency with the Purpose of this Easement.

 2. Grantee.

 under this Easement, such approval shall be granted or withheld in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request for approval, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 1. Grantor. If Grantor must undertake emergency action under Section V.C.1 to protect the public health or safety on the Property or must act by and subject to compulsion of any governmental agency, Grantor may proceed with such action without Grantee's approval only if Grantor notifies the Grantee prior to taking such action and Grantee cannot provide its approval, with or without conditions, within such time as is reasonable under the circumstances and restores the Fish Habitat Zone to a condition prior to such use or activity to the maximum extent possible.

 2. Grantee. Grantee's approval may be withheld only upon a reasonable determination by Grantee that the use or activity as proposed would be inconsistent with the Purpose or other terms and conditions of this Easement. Grantee's approval may include

 reasonable conditions that must be satisfied in undertaking the proposed use or activity.

 3. Failure to Approve Within the Required Time. When approval is required under this Easement, and when such approval is not granted or not withheld within the time period and manner set forth in this subsection, approval of the permitted use or activity in question may be presumed.

 B. Alternative Dispute Resolution. If a dispute is not resolved through preventive discussions under subsection A above, Grantor and Grantee may by mutual agreement submit the matter to mediation or arbitration upon such rules of mediation or arbitration as Grantor and Grantee may agree upon.

 IX. GRANTEE'S REMEDIES

 A. Notice of Failure. If Grantee determines that Grantor is in violation of the terms of this Easement or that a violation is threatened, Grantee shall give written notice to Grantor of such violation and demand corrective action sufficient to cure the violation and, where the violation involves injury to the Fish Habitat Zone resulting from any use or activity inconsistent with the Purpose of this Easement, to restore the portion of the Fish Habitat Zone so injured.

 B. Grantor's Failure to Respond. Grantee may bring an action as provided in Section C if Grantor:

 1. Fails to cure the violation within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of violation from the Grantee; or

 2. Under circumstances where the violation cannot reasonably be cured within a thirty (30) day period, fails to begin curing the

 violation within the thirty (30) day period and fails to continue diligently to cure such violation until finally cured.

 C. Grantee's Action. Grantee may bring an action at law or in equity in a court having jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Easement:

 1. To enjoin the violation, ex parte as necessary, by temporary or permanent injunction;

 2. To recover any damages to which it may be entitled for violation of the terms of this Easement or for injury to any Fish Habitat protected by this Easement, including damages for the loss of Fish Habitat; and

 3. To require the restoration of the Fish Habitat Zone to the condition that existed prior to any such injury.

 Without limiting Grantor's liability in any way, Grantee shall first apply any damages recovered to the cost of undertaking corrective or restoration action in the Fish Habitat Zone.

 D. Immediate Action Required. If Grantee, in its sole discretion, determines that circumstances require immediate action to prevent or mitigate significant damage to the Fish Habitat in the Fish Habitat Zone, Grantee may pursue its remedies under this section without prior notice to Grantor or without waiting for the period provided for cure to expire.

 E. Nature of Remedy. Grantee's rights under this section apply equally in the event of either actual or threatened violations of the terms of this Easement. Grantee shall be entitled to the injunctive relief described in this section in addition to such other relief to which Grantee may be entitled, including specific performance of the terms of this Easement, without the necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise available legal remedies. Grantee's remedies described in this section shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to all remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.

 F. Costs of Restoration. In the event Grantee must enforce the terms of this Easement, the costs of restoration necessitated by acts or omissions of Grantor, its agents, employees, contractors, family members, invitees or licensees in violation of the terms of this

 Easement shall be borne by Grantor or those of its personal representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns, against whom a judgment is entered. In the event that Grantee secures redress for an Easement violation without initiating or completing a judicial proceeding, the costs of such restoration shall be borne by Grantor or those of its personal representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns who are otherwise determined to be responsible for the unauthorized use or activity.

 G. Grantee's Forbearance. Enforcement of the terms of this Easement shall be at the discretion of Grantee, and any forbearance by Grantee to exercise its rights under this Easement in the event of any breach of any terms of this Easement by Grantor, its agents, employees, contractors, family members, invitees or licensees shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver by Grantee of such term or of any right under this Easement. No delay or omission by Grantee in the exercise of any right or remedy upon any breach by Grantor shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver.

 H. Acts Beyond Grantor's Control. Nothing contained in this Easement shall be construed to entitle Grantee to bring any action against Grantor to abate, correct, or restore any condition on the Fish Habitat Zone or to recover damages for any injury to or changes on the Fish Habitat Zone resulting from causes beyond Grantor's control, including, without limitation, natural changes, climate change, fire, flood, storm, or earth movement, or from acts of trespassers, or from any prudent action taken by Grantor under emergency conditions to prevent, abate, or mitigate significant injury to the Fish Habitat Zone resulting from such causes.

 I. Estoppel Certificates. Upon request by Grantor, Grantee shall within thirty (30) days execute and deliver to Grantor any document, including an estoppel certificate, that certifies, to the best actual knowledge of Grantee's HCP Program Manager (or successor thereto), whether or not Grantor is in compliance with all obligation of Grantor contained in this Easement, provided that any such document shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Grantee. Such certification shall be limited to the condition of the Property and Fish Habitat Zone as of Grantee's most recent inspection. If Grantor requests more current documentation, Grantee shall conduct an inspection, at Grantor's expense, within sixty (60) days of receipt of Grantor's written request therefor.

 A. Costs, Liabilities and Insurance. Grantor retains all responsibilities and shall bear all costs and liabilities of any kind related to the ownership, upkeep, and maintenance of the Property, including the maintenance of adequate liability insurance coverage. Grantor shall keep the Property free and clear of any liens arising out of any work performed for, material furnished to, or obligations incurred by Grantor; provided that the Property shall be deemed to be free of such liens if Grantor is diligently challenging the application of such liens to the Property.

 B. Taxes. Grantor shall pay all taxes levied against the Property by government authority as they become due, and shall furnish the Grantee with satisfactory evidence of payment upon request. If Grantor fails to pay any taxes when due, Grantee is authorized, but in no event obligated, to make or advance such payment of taxes upon three (3) days prior written notice to Grantor, in accordance with any bill, statement, or estimate procured from the appropriate authority, without inquiry into the validity of the taxes or the accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate, and the obligation created by such payment shall bear interest until paid by Grantor at the maximum rate allowed by law.

 C. Grantor Indemnification. Grantor shall hold harmless, indemnify, and defend the Grantee, its successors and assigns, and its officers, employees, contractors, agents, invitees and their successors, and assigns (collectively "Indemnified Grantee Parties") from and against all liabilities, penalties, costs, losses, damages, expenses, causes of action, claims, demands, or judgments, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees, arising from or in any way connected with:

 1. Injury to or death of any person, or physical damage to any property, resulting from any act or omission of Grantee, its officers, employees, agents, contractors or invitees related to or occurring in or about the Property that is a consequence of such persons' willful misconduct or negligent actions or omissions on or about the Property, except to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the Indemnified Grantor Parties; and

 2. Violations or alleged violations of any federal, state or local environmental law or regulation relating to pollutants or hazardous, toxic or dangerous substances or materials by Grantee, its officers, employees and agents, except to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the Indemnified Grantor Parties.

 A. Extinguishment. If circumstances arise in the future that render the Purpose of this Easement impossible to accomplish, this Easement can be terminated or extinguished, whether in whole or in part, only by mutual agreement of Grantor and Grantee or by judicial proceedings in a court having jurisdiction. The amount of the proceeds to which Grantee shall be entitled, after the satisfaction of prior claims, from any sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of all or any portion of the Property subsequent to such termination or extinguishment, shall be determined, unless otherwise provided by Washington law at the time, in accordance with Section XII.B of this Easement.

 3. Give written notice to the Grantee of the transfer of any

 RECITALS

 A. Assignor has entered into a conservation easement recorded under Auditor's File No. __________in King County, Washington ("Easement") with _____________________ (the "Easement Grantor") in regards to property located at _______________________, the legal description of which is set forth in Appendix A attached hereto (the "Property").

 B. The Easement provides for preservation, restoration, enhancement and stewardship of high quality spawning, rearing or refuge habitat for anadromous fish species and the natural features and processes sustaining such habitat ("Fish Habitat") within the portion of the Property described in Appendix B attached hereto (the "Fish Habitat Zone").

 C. The Easement allows Assignor to assign to Assignee certain rights for access to and stewardship of the Fish Habitat Zone.

In order to implement certain obligations of Assignor under the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan, dated April 21, 2000 ("HCP"), Assignor and Assignee have entered into the Agreement for Acquisition and Management of Fish Habitat dated as of ____________, 200_ (the "Agreement"). Among other things, the Agreement obligates Assignee to manage the Fish Habitat Zone to preserve, restore and/or enhance Fish Habitat. Assignor is assigning this Assignment to Assignee to effectuate Assignee's obligations under the Agreement.

 Now, therefore, the City and Cascade agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 1. Term. This Assignment shall be in full force and effect from the date first set forth above until Assignor no longer is the holder of the Easement, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.

 2. Assignment and Assumption. For and in consideration of Cascade's assumption of the obligations and responsibilities set forth in the Agreement and Section 3 of this Assignment, the City does hereby partially assign, transfer, set over, convey and deliver to Cascade the following undivided rights under the Easement, which rights shall be held in common by the City and Cascade:

 A. Identification, Protection, Restoration and Enhancement. To identify, preserve, and protect Fish Habitat within the Fish Habitat Zone, and to enhance and/or restore Fish Habitat therein by mutual agreement with the City.

 B. Access.

 (1) To enter the Fish Habitat Zone, as deemed necessary by Cascade, for the purpose of making a general inspection to assure compliance with the Easement. Cascade shall provide the Easement

 Grantor and the City with prior written notice of the inspection and shall conduct the inspection at a mutually agreeable date and time. Cascade shall enter the Fish Habitat Zone along established driveways and/or pathways (including lawns) across the Property, or along such route as may subsequently be identified by the Easement Grantor and the City.

 (2) To enter the Fish Habitat Zone along established driveways and/or pathways (including lawns) across the Property, or along such route as may subsequently be identified by the Easement Grantor and the City, at such other times as are necessary to undertake restoration, enhancement and other land management activities in the Fish Habitat Zone. Cascade shall provide the Easement Grantor and the City with prior written notice of the restoration, enhancement and/or land management activities and conduct such activities at mutually agreeable date(s) and time(s).

 C. Observation and Study. To allow persons or small groups to enter the Fish Habitat Zone along established driveways and/or

All persons or groups given permission to enter the Fish Habitat Zone shall sign a waiver, substantially in the form attached to the Easement as Appendix D, releasing the Easement Grantor, the City and Cascade from liability to the extent permitted by law.

 D. Signs. Upon the City's request, to place a limited number of signs to inform the public about the Easement. Location of signs shall be by mutual agreement of the Easement Grantor and the City.

 3. Assignee's Responsibilities. To accomplish the Purpose of the Easement, Cascade shall be responsible for the general upkeep and maintenance of the Fish Habitat Zone, consistent with the uses and activities reserved to the Easement Grantor under this Easement. General upkeep and maintenance entails the following:

 A. Monitoring. Conducting regular monitoring of the Protected Property (minimum of one visit per calendar quarter depending on activity) to check for dumping and other illegal activity, to evaluate compliance with terms of the Easement and to implement the general maintenance and stewardship tasks described below.

 B. General Maintenance

 (1) Maintaining appropriate perimeter postings of the Fish Habitat Zone, such as those relating to trespassing, hunting and public access generally;

 (2) Maintaining any fences, gates or barriers intended to keep motorized vehicles off the Fish Habitat Zone in a condition substantially similar to their condition as of the date of this Easement;

 (3) Removing garbage, closing trails, revegetating informal trails or otherwise taking reasonable measures to protect Fish Habitat in response to unauthorized uses of the Fish Habitat Zone by third parties other than Assignor; and

 (4) Advising Assignor, as grantee of the Easement, of any potential violations thereof.

 C. General Stewardship

 (1) Routine ecological stewardship. Providing stewardship services to retain and improve levels of biodiversity within the Fish Habitat Zone. Cascade will conduct at least three (3) stewardship event per year in the Fish Habitat Zone; provided, however, that this affirmative obligation for the Fish Habitat Zone shall be deemed to be met by Cascade if it has otherwise provided for the year in question at least three (3) stewardship events on each of seven (7) other properties acquired under the Agreement (collectively, the "Properties"). Each stewardship event involving volunteers shall use a minimum of fifteen (15) Conservation Corps or volunteer workers for a minimum of six (6) hours (not including transportation time). Cascade, in consultation with the City, will determine whether to use volunteer or skilled labor or some combination of the two, based upon the appropriate skill level required, safety considerations, technical skill requirements, and  efficacy in carrying out the required work tasks. Stewardship events for invasive weed removal shall occur during the months of February, July and September of the same year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. Typical ecological routine maintenance activities include:

 (a) Controlling noxious weeds, invasive species and pests as required by applicable law; and

 (b) Planting of native vegetation.

 (2) Capital Projects. Cascade will provide fund development and project planning for capital projects in the Fish Habitat Zone. Cascade will oversee implementation of any funded projects; staff time shall be paid through such project funds. Cascade will have primary responsibility of prioritizing and identifying the project site and activities (with guidance from and upon mutual agreement with the City), developing matching funds, and overseeing implementation. Capital projects shall be approved by the City in writing prior to implementation. Typical capital projects include:

 (a) Erosion control;

 (b) Bank stabilization using live-stake techniques; and/or

 (c) Installation of large woody debris.

 (3) Cascade and the City shall meet at least annually prior to the growing season to plan for Cascade's activities, including General Stewardship activities, on the Property and other Properties. The City and Cascade shall endeavor to be as efficient as possible in allocating the portion of the Annual Payment (as hereinafter defined) designated for General Stewardship among the above-described General Stewardship activities and across all the Properties. The parties recognize that the stewardship needs of the Properties may be unequal and, therefore, the expenditure of money for such activities on the Property in a given year may be zero or less than the amount spent on other Protected Properties. If the City and Cascade disagree on the aforesaid plan, the City's plan shall be adopted; provided, that Cascade shall be under no obligation to expend more effort on General Stewardship activities on the Property and all other Properties in a given year than the General Stewardship portion of the anticipated Annual Payments. Cascade shall inform the City of each of the General Stewardship events and activities scheduled on the Property at least two weeks prior to its occurrence.

 D. Specific Stewardship Actions. Implementing those stewardship elements (which may include demolition and removal of improvements existing as of the date of this Easement) specifically called out in the Present Conditions Report, as defined in the Easement, and agreed to by the City; provided, that Cascade shall have no right to any payment from the City for such actions without the prior written approval of the City, nor shall any portion of the Annual Payment be spent on Specific Stewardship Actions.

 E. Reporting. No later than December 31 of each year for so long as Assignee has management and stewardship responsibilities under this Assignment with respect to the Property, providing Assignor with a report that summarizes such activities during the previous year. The report shall indicate the nature of habitat improvements, structures, trails or other unauthorized man-made improvements, or potential threats to Fish Habitat, actions taken to preserve Fish Habitat, other general maintenance or general stewardship activities (including fund development for capital projects) required by or otherwise consistent with this Assignment, and other relevant information that may be requested by Assignor.

 4. Assignee's Exercise of Rights and Responsibilities

 Cascade hereby represents and warrants that its exercise of rights and responsibilities under this Assignment will be consistent with the Purpose of the Easement. In fulfilling its responsibilities hereunder, Assignee shall not be deemed to be an employee of Assignor, or shall Assignee be authorized to act as the agent or legal representative of Assignor for any purpose whatsoever. Assignee is not granted any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of or in the name of Assignor or to bind Assignor in any manner or thing whatsoever. Other than as specified herein, this Assignment is not intended to impose any legal or other responsibility on Cascade.

 5. Assignor's Responsibilities

 A. Annual Payment. Until January 1, 2051, the City shall pay Cascade $3,000 per year (in 2005 dollars) (the "Annual Payment")for its maintenance and stewardship of the Property in accordance with this Assignment. Of the Annual Payment, $2,250 shall be used by Cascade for Monitoring and General Maintenance of the Property (as described in sections 3.A and 3.B) and $750 shall be used for General Stewardship (as described in section 3.C) of all Properties. In the

 event that Cascade is able to provide Monitoring and General Maintenance of the Property for less than $2,250 in a given year, Cascade shall increase the work to be performed and Cascade's expenditure for General Stewardship of the Properties in the amount equaling the under-expenditure for Monitoring and General Maintenance of the Property. In the event that the Monitoring and General Maintenance required under section 3 for the Property in a given year costs more than $2,250, Cascade shall be responsible for such additional costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that unforeseeable circumstances occur, Cascade may request modification of its responsibilities under section 3 and/or an increased Annual Payment, and the City, in its sole discretion, will determine whether to grant such request.

 The Annual Payment shall be prorated for a portion of a year

 and adjusted for inflation by use of the Consumer Price Index or, when such index is unavailable, by use of recent Consumer Price Indices. Examples of inflation adjustments are shown in Schedule 1 hereto. Between December 1 and December 31 of each year through 2050, Cascade shall send City an invoice for the Annual Payment, documenting to City's reasonable satisfaction the Monitoring and General Maintenance performed on the Property and the General Stewardship performed on all Properties during that calendar year, and the City shall pay such invoice within 30 days of receipt.

 B. End of Annual Payment. Beginning on January 1, 2051 and continuing thereafter, the City no longer shall pay for maintenance and stewardship, but Cascade shall continue to provide all such services to the Property in accordance with this Assignment if, and for so long as, the City holds the Easement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, on and after January 1, 2051, Cascade, in its sole discretion may, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the City, terminate Cascade's obligations in accordance with section 7. Other than as specified herein, this Assignment is not intended to impose any legal or other responsibility on Assignor.

 6. Enforcement of Responsibilities under Assignment

 A. General. The City shall have the right to compel Cascade's fulfillment of its responsibilities under this Assignment and also to release Cascade from and terminate this Assignment, as set forth in this Section 6. Cascade shall have the right to compel the City's fulfillment of its responsibilities under this Assignment, as set forth in this Section 6. If one Party determines that the other party is not diligently performing its responsibilities under this Assignment or is otherwise in violation of its terms, the Party making such determination shall give the other Party written notice of the nonperformance or violation and thirty (30) days to correct it, or, under circumstances where the nonperformance or violation cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, such longer time as is reasonably necessary, provided that such other Party has begun curing the nonperformance or violation within such thirty (30) day period and is proceeding diligently to cure the nonperformance or violation, before proceeding to informal dispute resolution as described in Section 7.

 B. Informal Dispute Resolution. If the cure period described in Section 6.A, as applicable, has run and a cure not effectuated, Cascade's King County Senior Conservation Director and the City's HCP Program Manager, or their successors, shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute, except in a situation that could significantly diminish or impair the Fish Habitat in the Fish Habitat Zone of the Property. If the above-described persons cannot resolve the dispute in a timely manner, it shall be referred to the City's Resource Planning Branch Executive, Seattle Public Utilities, and Cascade's President, or their successors. Only upon failure to resolve the dispute in a timely manner through the foregoing process may the City pursue the remedies set forth in Section 6.C.

 C. Remedies. Either Party may bring an action at law or in equity to enforce the terms of this Easement, by seeking to enjoin the violation temporarily or permanently, to require restoration of the Protected Property to its condition prior to the injury and/or to recover any damages to which that Party may be entitled, as applicable. In addition, in the event that Assignee's nonperformance of its responsibilities under, or violation of, the terms of this Assignment is not resolved through informal dispute resolution, Assignor may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Assignment. Upon Assignor's request, Assignee shall execute a document evidencing such termination and Assignor may record it. The failure of either Party to discover a violation or to take immediate legal action shall not bar it from doing so at a later time, provided that each Party must act with reasonable promptness upon discovery to correct any claimed violation. Nothing herein shall limit the Parties' other remedies.

 7. Termination and Release

 A. Automatic Termination. Notwithstanding any provision of this Assignment to the contrary, if at any time during the term of this Assignment (1) Cascade, in its sole discretion, determines that it has become impractical for Cascade to undertake its rights and/or responsibilities under this Assignment and Cascade has given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the City, (2) Cascade ceases to exist or to be authorized to acquire and hold conservation easement interests under RCW 64.04.130 and 84.34.210 (or any successor provision(s) then applicable), (3) bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are commenced against Cascade, (4) the Agreement has been terminated for any reason by Cascade, in accordance with its terms, or (5) the procedures described in Section 6 have been followed, and the City and Cascade have been unable to resolve a dispute about Cascade's fulfillment of its obligations under this Assignment, then this Assignment and Cascade's rights and responsibilities hereunder shall terminate automatically upon the City's notice of same to Cascade.

 B. Optional Termination. If the City terminates the Agreement, the City may leave any then-existing Assignments in effect or, in the City's sole discretion, require their termination. Said termination shall be effective upon notice from the City. Upon request, Cascade shall execute such documents as the City reasonably requests to evidence such termination. In addition, on and after January 1, 2051, Cascade in its sole discretion may terminate this

 Assignment by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice of same to the City. In such event, the Parties shall execute and record the applicable document.

 8. No Interest in Easement. Cascade acknowledges that it has no compensable interest in the Easement. In particular, Cascade acknowledges that if the Easement is extinguished or the Fish Habitat Zone is taken, in whole or in part, by exercise of the power of eminent domain, only the City (and not Cascade) is entitled to compensation.

 9. Liability and Indemnification

 A. The City assumes no responsibility for the payment of any compensation, fees, wages, benefits or taxes to or on behalf of Cascade, its employees, contractors or others by reason of this Easement. Cascade shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the City, its officers, agents and employees from any and all claims, cost and liabilities whatsoever occurring or resulting from: (1) Cascade's failure to pay any compensation, fees, wages, benefits or

 taxes; and (2) the supplying to Cascade or the City of work, services, materials or supplies by Cascade's employees or agents or other contractors or suppliers in connection with or in support of performance of Cascade's obligations under this Easement.

 B. Cascade shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the City and its officers, employees, agents and contractors, and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liabilities, penalties, losses, costs, damages, claims, causes of action, demands or judgments, or awards of damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in any way connected with a breach of this Assignment by Cascade, its officers, agents or employees, negligent action or inaction of Cascade, its officers, agents or employees in the acquisition or stewardship of the Properties, or their failure to comply with all applicable laws. For purpose of this Assignment only, Cascade waives the immunity granted it for industrial insurance claims pursuant to Revised Code of Washington Chapter 51 to the extent necessary to extend its obligations under this section to any claim, demand, or cause of action brought by or on behalf of any employee of Cascade, including judgments, awards and costs arising therefrom and including attorney's fees. The Parties acknowledge that these provisions were specifically negotiated and agreed by them.

 10. Interpretation. The defined terms in this Assignment shall have the meaning provided in the Easement unless specifically defined herein. All recitals and Appendices to this Assignment are, by this reference, incorporated herein.

 EXHIBIT D TO AGREEMENT FOR ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISH HABITAT FORM OF REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

 This REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into by and between ___________________, __________________ ("Seller"), and CASCADE LAND CONSERVANCY, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("Cascade"), and its successors and assigns, as of the date appearing in the last paragraph of this Agreement ("Effective Date"). Cascade, its successors and assigns shall hereinafter be referred to collectively as "Buyer." Buyer and Seller shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the "Parties."

 RECITALS

 A. Seller owns certain real property situated in King County, Washington, more particularly described on Appendix "A" attached hereto and defined in Section 1 below (the "Property").

 B. Seller desires to sell [the Property/a conservation easement over the Property] to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase [the Property/a conservation easement over the Property] from Seller on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. [The conservation easement over the Property shall be substantially in the form provided at Appendix "C" attached hereto ("Easement").]

 C. Seller acknowledges that Cascade intends to assign this Agreement and the rights, title and interest herein to the City of Seattle (the "City") before Closing (as defined below) and that such assignment shall be a condition of Closing. If and until such assignment occurs, "Buyer" shall refer solely to Cascade. Upon assignment to and assumption by the City of all of the rights and interest in this Agreement and the Property, "Buyer" shall refer solely to the City.

 [D. Seller believes that the purchase price specified herein for the Property/the Easement is below the fair market value of the Property/the Easement. Seller intends that the difference between the purchase price and fair market value shall be a charitable contribution to Buyer. However, Buyer makes no representation as to the tax consequences of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will obtain independent tax counsel and be solely responsible for compliance with the gift value substantiation requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent that the purchase price is below fair market value, the Parties agree that it does not reflect the existence of defects in the Property, such as environmental conditions requiring remediation, known to Seller or Buyer.]

 AGREEMENT

 In consideration of the foregoing and the performance of the mutual covenants herein contained, Seller and Buyer agree as follows:

 1. PROPERTY: The "Property" subject to this Agreement consists of all of the following:

 1.1 That certain real property legally described in the attached Appendix "A, " including all improvements thereon ("Land").

 1.2 [for purchase of Property only] All rights, privileges and easements appurtenant to the Land, including without limitation all minerals, oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances on the Land, all development rights, timber, timber rights, air rights, water, water rights and water stock relating to the Land, and any and all easements, rights-of-way and other appurtenances used in connection with the beneficial use and enjoyment of the Land (collectively, the "Appurtenances").

 2. PURCHASE OF PROPERTY/EASEMENT: Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase the Property/Easement.

 2.1 Purchase Price: The total purchase price for the

 Property/the Easement is ____________________________________________________and No/100 Dollars (US $____________.00) ("Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price is payable at Closing in cash.

 2.2 Earnest Money: Upon execution of this Agreement, Buyer will execute a promissory note in favor of Seller in the amount of ____________________________ and No/100 Dollars ($________.00), in the form attached hereto as Appendix "B" (the "Note") and incorporated herein by this reference, and deposit the Note with Pacific Northwest Title Insurance Company ("Escrow Holder") to be held in escrow as earnest money. The Note shall be due on delivery of Buyer's notice that the contingencies described in Section 4 have been satisfied or removed. The funds deposited in payment of the Note (the "Deposit") shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing. Escrow Holder shall place the Deposit in an interest bearing money market-type account. Interest shall be for Buyer's benefit. The Note or Deposit (plus interest), as applicable, shall be refunded to Buyer unless all of Buyer's conditions hereunder are satisfied.

 IN THE EVENT BUYER FAILS, WITHOUT LEGAL EXCUSE, TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY/EASEMENT AS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE FORFEITED TO SELLER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO SELLER. Buyer and Seller agree that the liquidated damages represent a reasonable sum considering all of the circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement and represent a reasonable estimate of the losses that Seller will incur if Buyer fails to purchase the Property/Easement after all conditions precedent to Buyer's performance have been completely satisfied in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion.

 3. TITLE:

 3.1 Title & Conveyance: At Closing, Seller will execute and deliver to Buyer a [statutory warranty deed/special warranty deed] conveying good and marketable fee simple title to the Property/Easement free and clear of all defects or encumbrances done or suffered by Seller except for the lien of real estate taxes and drainage service charges and other governmental assessments not yet due and payable and those defects and/or encumbrances (if any) accepted by Buyer as Permitted Exceptions pursuant to Section 3.3. Seller shall approve the form of the deed(s), including any Deed of Conservation Easement, provided that Seller may withhold its approval only to the extent that such deed(s) contain(s) representations, warranties or covenants or other obligations on the part of Seller that exceed those provided by Seller under this Agreement. Buyer shall provide the forms of deed(s) to Seller for its review and approval no later than the end of Buyer's feasibility contingency provided in Section 4.2. If Seller objects to the form of the deed(s) on a basis allowed for herein and Buyer revises the form of the deed(s) to remove such objection, Seller shall grant its approval of the form.

 3.2 Title Insurance: Buyer shall obtain a title insurance commitment (the "Commitment") issued by the Pacific Northwest Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"), showing marketable title to the Property vested in Seller. At Closing, Buyer shall receive an owner's Standard ALTA (1970 with 1984 revisions) policy of title insurance, dated as of the Closing date and insuring Buyer in the amount of the Purchase Price against loss or damage by reason of defect in the title to the Property subject only to the printed exclusions appearing in the policy form and any Permitted Exceptions (as defined below).

 3.3 Review of Title: Buyer shall notify Seller, by the end of Buyer's Feasibility Contingency Period, as defined in Section 4, either (a) that Buyer has approved the Commitment and thereby intends to proceed with the purchase of the Property/Easement or (b) of those exceptions that Buyer objects to and the reason for such objection (any exceptions contained within the Commitment not so objected to shall thereafter be "Permitted Exceptions"). Buyer's failure to object to any title exception within the time stated above shall be deemed an approval of the quality of title reflected in the Commitment. Thereafter, any liens, leases, encumbrances, easements, restrictions, conditions, covenants, rights-of-way and other matters affecting title to the Property that are created and which may appear of record or be revealed by survey or otherwise after the date of the Commitment but before the Closing date (collectively, "Intervening Exceptions") shall be subject to Buyer's approval and Buyer shall have ten (10) Working Days after notice in writing of any Intervening Exception, together with a description thereof and a copy of the instrument creating or evidencing the Intervening Exception, if any, to either accept it (whereupon the Intervening Exception shall be a Permitted Exception) or submit written objection and the reasons therefore to Seller.

 Seller shall have five (5) Working Days following receipt from Buyer of any notice of objection(s) to notify Buyer in writing of any such objections which Seller does not intend to attempt to eliminate. The failure of Seller to respond in writing within the time stated shall be deemed an agreement by Seller to attempt to remove Buyer's objection(s) by modification or removal of the exception(s) objected to by Buyer.
