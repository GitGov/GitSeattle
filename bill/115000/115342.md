 AN ORDINANCE relating to public art museum facilities; authorizing and providing for the completion and execution of a guarantee and reimbursement agreement with the Museum Development Authority and other parties; authorizing a City guarantee for the debt service reserve established in connection with the Authority's special obligation bonds issued to pay the cost of acquiring and equipping an addition to its downtown museum facilities; and authorizing or prohibiting various other actions by the Director of Finance and other City officers in connection with the guarantee.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), by Ordinance 112923, passed July 7, 1986, determined that a public art museum in downtown Seattle would make the considerable collections of the Seattle Art Museum, a Washington nonprofit corporation (the "Museum"), more accessible to the public; would provide a facility capable of hosting major touring exhibitions; would include space needed for the Museum's educational, administrative and curatorial activities; and would contribute to the economic viability and attractiveness of downtown Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City chartered the Museum Development Authority (the "Authority") pursuant to RCW 35.21.730, et seq. and Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Chapter 3.110 (Ordinance 103387, as amended) to undertake, assist with and otherwise facilitate the development and operation of a public art museum in downtown Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, on September 16, 1986, Seattle voters approved a measure authorizing annual taxes to fund construction of a downtown art museum facility; and

 WHEREAS, in order to facilitate the financing of construction of a new downtown museum facility, the City and the Authority entered into a Museum Cooperation Agreement dated as of December 8, 1986, pertaining to the financing, construction and operation of the downtown museum facility. That agreement enabled $24,795,000 of the Authority's bonds to be supported by the proceeds of the 1986 voter- approved levy. Those bonds have now been retired; and

 WHEREAS, the construction of the downtown museum facility was completed in late 1991. That facility has been owned by the Authority and operated by the Museum, pursuant to the "Operating Agreement (Part II) for the Design, Development, Construction and Operation of a Public Art Museum" dated September 25, 1985, between the Authority and the Museum; and

 WHEREAS, in October 1994, the Authority issued its bonds to refinance the cost of acquiring the site of the downtown museum facility and, by Ordinance 117317, passed September 26, 1994, the City authorized a Cooperation Agreement between the City and the Authority, dated as of October 1, 1994, under which the City agreed to guarantee the payment of the 1994 bonds when due. These bonds have now been retired; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority now has an opportunity to expand the Existing Museum Facility by the acquisition of a condominium unit now under construction and consisting of four levels (the "MDA Unit"), which is to be owned by the Authority and leased to the Museum for a term of 99 years; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority intends to finance the acquisition and its equipping of the MDA Unit through the issuance of its Special Obligation Bonds, 2005 (the "Bonds") in a principal amount not to exceed $65,000,000, which are expected to be repaid from rent payments received from the Museum; and

 WHEREAS, to receive the most favorable interest rates on the Bonds, the Authority has requested that the City guarantee the replenishment of the debt service reserve fund established for the Bonds; and

 WHEREAS, in return for a City guarantee of the debt service reserve for the Bonds, the Authority and the Museum will agree to provide the City with certain security and covenants; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Finance has negotiated a proposed guarantee and reimbursement agreement (the "Proposed Guarantee Agreement") by and among the City, the Authority, the Museum, and U.S. Bank National Association, as bond trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Lockbox Agent, which Proposed Guarantee Agreement has been filed in Clerk File 307639; NOW THEREFORE,
