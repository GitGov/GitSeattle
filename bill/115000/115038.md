 Owner, specifically and expressly agrees that the foregoing indemnity covers actions brought by any employee of Owner, that the foregoing indemnity is specifically and expressly intended to constitute a waiver in favor only of The City of Seattle of Owner's immunity under Title 51 of the Revised Code of Washington to the extent necessary to provide The City of Seattle, its successors and assigns, with a full and complete indemnity from claims made by employees of Owner, and that such waiver of immunity was mutually negotiated by the parties.

 6. Successors and Assigns. The rights, obligations and indemnities set forth in this Reservation are intended to run with the land burdened and benefited thereby and to bind Owner; provided, that any Owner shall be released from all liability hereunder accruing after a sale of the Quinton Property by such Owner.

 7. Termination.

The owner of Parcel A agrees to pay its share of the costs and expenses within ten (10) days after the same is deemed to be true, correct and final.

 4. Rights Not Separately Assignable. The rights granted under this Agreement, including the Access Easement, are appurtenant to Parcel B and Parcel C.
