 Exhibit A: Form of Agreement (500 Mercer -Additional Affordable Housing Subsidy)

 Mark Ellerbrook/ME

 500 Mercer Project

 June 19, 2006

 Attachment A

 Form of Agreement

 500 Mercer

 Additional Affordable Housing Subsidy

 I. Introduction

 This Agreement is made between The City of Seattle (the "City"), acting through the Office of Housing, and 500 Mercer Partners, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Developer"). The purpose of this Agreement is to amend the terms of sale of the former City owned property at 500 Mercer St. in Seattle, more particularly described on Exhibit A hereto ("Property"), as such terms relate to affordable housing.

 II. Recitals

 The Developer is constructing a residential condominium project (the "Project") at 500 Mercer Street. Pursuant to the Conditional Contract for Sale of Land dated __________________, 200_, as part of the consideration for the Property, Developer agreed to pay the City an Affordable Housing Subsidy of $591,000 (referred to, together with interest earned by the City on such amount, as the "Subsidy"). Pursuant to an Option and Regulatory Agreement Affecting Development and Sale of Condominium Housing Units between the City and the Developer, signed by the Developer on Sept. 16, 2003 ("Option"), which is disclosed by a Regulatory Memorandum recorded in the office of the King County Recorder under file number 20031002002554, the City had the right to designate some of the condominium units built by Developer on the Property and adjacent Property as affordable housing units, if the City elected to use the Subsidy for down payment assistance for low-income homebuyers acquiring those units. The City made that election; however, no units have yet been sold to such homebuyers. Recognizing the high costs of the units in the Project, the Developer desires to obtain the release of the Option, and is willing to pay the City an additional $157,500 for the purpose of subsidizing affordable housing off-site.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants herein, the City and Developer agree as follows:

 III. Agreement

 1. Payment Terms

 The Developer hereby agrees to pay to the City of Seattle $157,500, upon the following terms: The Developer will pay to the City $26,250 on the date of closing of the sale of each of the following units in the Project: nos. R102, R202, R302, F231, F331, and R29 (the "Option Units"), but in any event Developer shall pay the City a total of $157,500 no later than July 31, 2007. Such amount is in addition to the Subsidy.

 2. Use of Funds

 The Developer releases the City from any obligation to use the Subsidy for purchasers of units at the Project. The City shall use the Subsidy, and the additional amount payable under Section 1 of this Agreement, to support affordable housing or low-income home buyers in such manner and at such locations as the City shall determine.

 3. Option Units, Release of Units from Option

 A. The parties agree that the City has the right under the Option, assignable to eligible homebuyers, to purchase the six (6) Option Units in the Project at prices determined under the Option, and any claims for any higher or lower number of Affordable Homeownership Units, or any different Units, pursuant to the terms of the Option, are hereby waived.

 B. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, or the effectiveness of the Ordinance authorizing this Agreement, if later, the City and Developer shall execute and the Developer shall record a Memorandum of Amendment to the Option, declaring that it is released as to all units except the Option Units.

 C. In addition, promptly upon payment of the additional $157,500 to the City, the City will sign in recordable form a document releasing the Developer and the Property from all requirements under the Option. If so requested by the Developer, the City will provide partial releases for each Option Unit from the Option promptly upon the payment of $26,250 ("Release Amount") pursuant to Section 1 above for that Option Unit. The Developer shall be responsible for all costs of recording releases.

 D. Developer acknowledges and agrees that until released under this Section, the Option, as modified by Section 4, shall remain in effect as to each Option Unit.

 4. Default and Remedies

 A. If Developer shall close the sale of any Option Unit without payment of the Release Amount for that Unit to the City, the City may, at its option, declare the entire unpaid balance under Section 1 immediately due and payable. If any portion of the amount owing under Section 1 is not paid when due, then the City, at its sole election, may exercise and enforce the Option, as modified in this Section, with respect to any or all Option Units that shall not then have been released from the Option. If the City elects to exercise the Option as to an Option Unit, then:

 (1) Upon conveyance of the Option Unit to the City or its assignee on the terms established under the Option, the Developer shall be released from a portion of its monetary obligation hereunder equal to the Release Amount for that Option Unit.

 (2) If Developer shall default on its obligation with respect to the Option Unit then the City may obtain specific performance, or sue for damages, or declare the Release Amount for that Option Unit due and payable, with interest at 12% per annum from and after July 31, 2007, all at the City's sole option.

 (3) The Release Amount for that Option Unit shall not be due unless and until the Developer shall fail to perform its obligations with respect to that Option Unit, and the City shall elect to declare such amount due and payable.

 B. As a condition to the exercise of the Option under this section, the City shall not be required to allocate any of the Affordable Housing Subsidy or interest thereon to subsidies for buyers of Option Units. Instead, the City either shall provide sufficient down payment assistance, on such terms as the City shall determine are appropriate, so that an eligible buyer, selected by the City, is able to purchase the Option Unit, or the City shall purchase the Option Unit itself, or the City shall assign its Option on the unit to a nonprofit corporation which shall be entitled to purchase the Option Unit. The Grantor shall have no right or obligation with respect to finding or designating buyers for any Option Units as to which the City shall exercise the Option.

 5. Entire Agreement; Construction

 This Agreement contains all the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties. No other understandings, oral or otherwise, regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall bind any of the parties hereto. Except as expressly set forth herein, the Option remains in full force and effect. This Agreement is the product of negotiation and shall not be construed strictly in favor of or against either party.

 6. Miscellaneous

 Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Option unless the context otherwise requires. Any legal action arising out of this Agreement shall take place in King County Superior Court. If any provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms shall remain in full force and effect. Time is of the essence of the provisions of this Agreement.
