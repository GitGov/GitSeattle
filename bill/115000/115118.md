 AN ORDINANCE related to affirmative efforts to ensure equality in City contracting practices; creating a new Chapter 20.42 and repealing Chapters 20.44 and 20.46A of the Seattle Municipal Code; and amending other provisions throughout the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, Initiative 200, codified as the Section 49.60.400 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), became effective on December 3, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 49.60.400 prohibits preferences based on race or gender in City contracting practices and therefore nullifies significant portions of the City of Seattle's Women and Minority Business Enterprise (WMBE) and affirmative action programs as codified in Chapters 20.44 and 20.46A of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC); and

 WHEREAS, Seattle and King County residents overwhelmingly opposed I- 200 and its restrictions on affirmative efforts to create equity in contracting and employment; and

 WHEREAS, SMC Ch. 20.44 has not been substantially updated since 1972 and SMC Ch. 20.46A has not been substantially updated since 1994; and

 WHEREAS, portions of both Chapters 20.44 and 20.46A have not been revised to address the changes in State law and, therefore, are difficult to use effectively to aggressively implement legal activities in support of women and minority businesses; and

 WHEREAS, the provisions of this ordinance are necessary to respond to the dramatic decline in the use of women and minority owned business enterprises by City contractors and to prevent the City from inadvertently financing and passively participating in this discrimination with its contracting dollars; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 49.60.400 does not prohibit the City from taking aggressive means to ensure equality in contracting including efforts to do outreach to and create opportunities for small and economically disadvantaged businesses, including women and minority owned businesses; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.22.650 directs the City, in its public works contracts, to require contractors to actively solicit the employment of women and minority group members and actively solicit bids for the subcontracting of goods or services from qualified women and minority businesses; and

 WHEREAS, it is more practical to create a new chapter of the Seattle Municipal Code that clearly states the expectations of the City with regard to equity in contracting practices and requires aggressive affirmative efforts to overcome the effects of discriminatory practices, rather than amending the current provisions; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to include stronger and detailed outreach requirements in contracts to address particular projects and types of activities, to develop detailed outreach plans and to implement affirmative efforts; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance will preserve and update provisions allowing the City to assist contractors (majority and minority) and community agencies to accomplish diversity program efforts and give greater power to the Director of Executive Administration to evaluate compliance, terminate agreements for non-compliance, and to debar offenders; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance is consistent with the Race & Social Justice initiative that calls for updating programs to better address inadvertent or institutional practices that prevent inclusion or are exclusionary; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Chapter 20.42, entitled "Equality in Contracting," is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:
