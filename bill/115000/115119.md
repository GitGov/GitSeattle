 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to consultant contracting; changing filing requirements; redefining the term "consultant;" making technical corrections and updating language; exempting consultant services obtained by the City under a contract executed by a state, agency, or subdivision thereof from additional competitive selection requirements; and amending and recodifying Chapter 3.114 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, the Copernicus project recommended that the Department of Executive Administration ensure that current City contracting processes are in synch with the Contracting Services Division Redesign effort; and

 WHEREAS, the Copernicus project recommended that the Department of Executive Administration modify or eliminate legislation that unnecessarily encumbers the City's contracting process; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of the City Auditor issued a report entitled "Administration of City Consultant Contracts" on August 19, 2002, which report concluded that "...City departments retained consultants for appropriate purposes and generally complied with City policies and rules in executing consultant contracts, with the exception of contract filing requirements;" and

 WHEREAS, technology and record-keeping practices and standards have changed significantly since the consultant ordinance was adopted in 1979, making it easier to audit departments and eliminating the need for duplicative filing requirements; and

 WHEREAS, existing ordinances allow the City to purchase goods and non- consultant services through contracts executed by a state, or agency or subdivision thereof, or by another governmental unit or any public benefit nonprofit corporation; and

 WHEREAS, the City has, on occasion, saved duplicative time, cost, and effort purchasing goods and services through these existing contracts rather than executing a separate competitive process; and

 WHEREAS, other governmental units also have similar contracts with consultants that contain favorable terms and that allow other entities like the City to utilize the existing terms and prices for related work; and

 WHEREAS, the City could on occasion utilize these contracts to avoid unnecessary duplicative process; and

 WHEREAS, the Council has authorized departments to conduct competitive processes and select consultants because advisory services are seen as personal to the mission of the administering agency; and

 WHEREAS, it is critical that the City protect the attorney-client relationship when seeking outside legal counsel; and

 WHEREAS, the City's consultant procurement legislation is currently located in Title 3 of the Seattle Municipal Code, under General Regulations; and

 WHEREAS, Title 20 of the Seattle Municipal Code was set-aside for "Public Works, Improvements and Purchasing" and the purpose of publishing the Code is to allow citizens access to important laws; and
