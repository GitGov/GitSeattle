 AN ORDINANCE relating to the admission tax; providing for an exemption from the admission tax for the Children's Charity Bacon Bowl Football Game; and amending Sections 5.40.020 and 5.40.025 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, the City recognizes that the Children's Charity Bacon Bowl Football Game, held since 1979, is an important annual community event and one of the largest charity football games in the United States, and exempting it from admission tax requirements will contribute to its continued growth and future success; and
