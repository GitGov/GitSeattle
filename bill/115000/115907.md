 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE superseding Ordinance 121885 to authorize the Personnel Director to provide a wage supplement and health care benefits for employees who were mobilized by the United States Armed Forces for active military service both before and since January 1, 2005, and providing that both the wage supplement and the benefits provisions of the ordinance will expire at the same time.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120682 authorized the Personnel Director to continue health coverage for employees who are mobilized by the United States Armed Forces for active military service for Operation Enduring Freedom between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council approved the extension of health care and other employee benefits to City of Seattle employees who were mobilized for active military duty in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005; by Ordinances 121058, 121369, 121692 respectively; and

 WHEREAS, the City by Ordinance 121885 legislated further support for these employees by implementing a wage supplement program to pay them the difference between their base military wages and their base City wages, if higher, while they are on active military duty; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121885 applied to City employees ordered to active military duty since January 1, 2005 and still on active military duty on July 27, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121885 did not include City employees in the wage supplement section who had been called to active military service before January 1, 2005 and who were still on active military duty on July 27, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle employees who are members of the United States military reserves and the National Guard continue to be activated for duty in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective July 27, 2005 any employee of the City of Seattle who is ordered to active military duty by the United States government and who has exhausted his or her annual paid military leave benefit and is on unpaid military leave of absence shall be eligible to receive the difference between his or her base military wage and the regular base rate of pay he or she would have received for his or her City position, if higher. All employees ordered to active

 military duty prior to and since January 1, 2005 and still on active military duty on July 27, 2005, and all employees activated for military duty thereafter shall be eligible for the wage supplement provided by this section pursuant to program guidelines and procedures developed by the Personnel Director consistent with Internal Revenue Service regulations. Eligible employees ordered to active military duty before January 1, 2005 who were still on active military duty on July 27, 2005 and who did not receive the wage supplement under the superseded ordinance will receive the wage supplement retroactive to July 27, 2005.

 Section 2. Any employee of the City of Seattle who is ordered to active military duty by the United States government and who has exhausted his or her annual paid military leave benefit and is on unpaid military leave of absence shall be eligible to retain the medical, dental and vision services coverage and optional insurance coverage, including but not necessarily limited to Group Term Life (Basic and Supplemental), Long Term Disability, and Accidental Death and Dismemberment, provided as a benefit of their employment with the City of Seattle, at the same level and under the same conditions as though they were in the City's employ, pursuant to program guidelines and procedures developed by the Personnel Director. Eligibility for coverage shall be effective for the duration of the employee's active deployment but not to exceed the expiration of authority provided in Section 3 of this ordinance. The employee becomes eligible for coverage as an activated military reservist the month after he or she last has regular coverage as a result of being on City pay status.

 Section 3. The authority granted under this ordinance shall expire on December 31, 2010 or when the United States Armed Forces officially withdraws from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, whichever occurs first.

 Section 4. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
