 Intergovernmental Land Transfer Agreement Between

 King County and the City of Seattle

 Relating to the Ownership, Operation and Maintenance of South Park Farm

 This Agreement is made and entered into this ___________ day of ___________, 2004 by and between the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation, hereinafter called "City", and King County, a political subdivision of the State of Washington, hereinafter called "County".

 WHEREAS the County acquired the real property commonly known as South Park Farm under the authority of RCW 36.89.050, and other state statutes, as part of its park, recreation and open space system that depends on the continued operation of its many individual properties and facilities in order to fully serve the needs of the residents of King County and the cities within it; and

 WHEREAS the County desires to divest itself of ownership, management, and financial responsibility for parks, open space, recreational facilities and programs, such as South Park Farm, that are located inside the City's boundaries; and

 WHEREAS the County has determined that it does not have a sufficient, stable source of revenue to continue to manage and maintain South Park Farm at current levels; and

 WHEREAS the County has determined that it is legally restricted from converting South Park Farm from its current uses without expending funds to replace the converted facilities; and

 WHEREAS the County has determined that given the legal restriction regarding conversion of South Park Farm, the marketability is limited and, as a result, the value of the property to the County is approximately equal to the cost of operating it; and

 WHEREAS, under RCW 36.89.050, the County may transfer South Park Farm to the City subject to the City's maintaining South Park Farm for park, open space and recreation purposes or replacing it with equivalent facilities; and

 WHEREAS the County desires to transfer South Park Farm to the City for park, open space and recreation purposes in consideration of the City's covenant to maintain South Park Farm for those purposes, and the City is willing to accept ownership and responsibility to operate and maintain South Park Farm subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the City and the County agree as follows:

 1. Conveyance of Title

 1.1.Within thirty (30) days of execution of this Agreement, the County shall convey to the City by bargain and sale deed, subject to those encumbrances identified in Exhibit A, all its right, title and interest in the property located in Seattle and known as South Park Farm, as legally described on Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Property").

 1.2 The deed shall contain the following specific covenants pertaining to use, which covenants shall run with the land for the benefit of the County and the County land that makes up its public park, recreation and open space system. The County and the City agree that the County shall have standing to enforce these covenants, which shall be set forth as follows:

 "The City, as required by RCW 36.89.050, covenants that the Property shall be continued to be used for open space, park, or recreation facility purposes or that other equivalent facilities within the County shall be conveyed to the County in exchange therefore."

 "The City acknowledges that the Property was purchased for open space purposes with funds from Open Space Bonds authorized in 1989 by King County Ordinance 9071 and covenants that it shall abide by and enforce all terms, conditions and restrictions in Ordinance 9071, including that the City covenants that the Property will continue to be used for the purposes contemplated by Ordinance 9071, which would exclude both active recreation and motorized recreation such as off-road recreational vehicles but allows passive recreation, that the Property shall not be transferred or conveyed except by agreement providing that the Property shall continue to be used for the purposes contemplated by Ordinance 9071, and that the Property shall not be converted to a different use unless other equivalent lands and facilities within the County or the City shall be received in exchange therefore."

 "The City covenants that it shall not use the Property in a manner that would cause the interest on County 1989 Open Space bonds related to the Property to no longer be exempt from federal income taxation."

 "The City further covenants that it will not limit or restrict access to and use of the Property by non-city residents in any way that does not also apply to city residents. The City covenants that any and all user fees charged for the Property, including charges imposed by any lessees, concessionaires, service providers, and/or other assignees shall be at the same rate for non-city residents as for the residents of the city."

 "The City covenants that it shall place the preceding covenants in any deed transferring the Property or a portion of the Property for public park, recreation or open space uses."

 1.3 Upon conveyance of the deed, the City and the County agree that the City is the County's assign for the purposes of the indemnification provision contained in paragraph 5.7 of that certain Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement between Fibres International, LLC and King County, fully executed as of January 14, 1998, concerning that portion of the Property legally described as Parcels A and B on Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein.

 2. Existing Restrictions, Agreements, Contracts or Permits

 2.1 The City shall abide by and enforce all terms, conditions, reservations, restrictions and covenants of title identified in Exhibit A and/or in the deed of conveyance.

 3. Condition of Premises and Responsibility for Operations, Maintenance, Repairs, Improvements, and Recreation Services

 3.1 The City has inspected and knows the condition of the Property and agrees to accept the Property in AS IS condition, subject to the provisions of Section 4 below, and to assume full and complete responsibility for all operations, maintenance, repairs, improvements of, and provision of recreational services at, the Property.

 3.2 King County does not make and specifically disclaims any warranties, express or implied, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the Property, and no official, employee, representative or agent of King County is authorized otherwise.

 3.3 Prior to closing, the County will provide the City with contact information for the primary organizations that use the Property.

 3.4 The City acknowledges and agrees that except as specified in paragraph 4.2, the County shall have no liability for, and that the City shall release and have no recourse against the County for, any defect or deficiency of any kind whatsoever in the Property without regard to whether such defect or deficiency was known or discoverable by the City or the County.

 4. Environmental Liability

 4.1 "Hazardous Materials" as used herein shall mean any hazardous, dangerous or toxic wastes, materials, or substances as defined in state or federal statutes or regulations as currently adopted or hereafter amended.

 4.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to waive any statutory claim for contribution that the City might have against the County under federal or state environmental statutes that arises from Hazardous Materials deposited or released on the Property by the County during the County's period of ownership. The City may not, however, assert such a claim to the extent that the City creates the need for or exacerbates the cost of remediation upon which a statutory claim for contribution is based as a result of the City performing construction activities on the Property, changing the configuration of the Property or changing the use of the Property.

 4.3 If the City discovers the presence of Hazardous Materials at levels that could give rise to a statutory claim for contribution against the County it shall reasonably promptly notify the County in writing. The parties shall make their best efforts to reach agreement as to which party is responsible for remediation under the terms of this Agreement prior to undertaking any remediation. In no event shall the County be responsible for any costs of remediation that exceed the minimum necessary to satisfy the state or federal agency with jurisdiction over the remediation.

In the event that any suit based upon such a claim, action, loss or damage is brought against the City or the City and the County, the County shall defend the same at its sole cost and expense and, if final judgment be rendered against the City and its elected officials, officers, agents and employees or jointly against the City and the County and their respective elected officials, officers, agents and employees, the County shall satisfy the same.

 5.2 In executing this Agreement, the County does not assume liability or responsibility for or in any way release the City from any liability or responsibility which arises in whole or in part from the existence or effect of City ordinances, rules or regulations.

 5.3 The City shall indemnify and hold harmless the County and its elected officials, officers, agents and employees, or any of them, from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses and damages of any nature whatsoever, (i) which are caused by or result from a negligent act or omission of the City, its officers, agents and employees in performing obligations pursuant to this Agreement, and/or (ii) arising from those occurrences related to the Property that occurred on or after the effective date of conveyance of the Property to the City, except to the extent that indemnifying or holding the County harmless would be limited by Section 4 of this Agreement. In the event that any suit based upon such a claim, action, loss or damage is brought against the County or the County and the City, the City shall defend the same at its sole cost and expense and, if final judgment be rendered against the County and its officers, agents and employees or jointly against the County and the City and their respective officers, agents and employees, the City shall satisfy the same.

 5.4 Each party to this Agreement shall reasonably promptly notify the other of any and all claims, actions, losses or damages that arise or are brought against that party relating to or pertaining to the Property.

 5.5 Each party agrees that its obligations under this Section 5 extend to any claim, demand, and/or cause of action brought by or on behalf of any employees, or agents. For this purpose, each party, by mutual negotiation, hereby waives, with respect to the other party only, any immunity that would otherwise be available against such claims under the Industrial Insurance provisions of Title 51 RCW, but only to the extent necessary to indemnify the other party.

 6. Audits and Inspections

 6.1 Prior to closing, the County shall provide the City with copies of its records related to any matters covered by this Agreement that are not privileged.

 7. Waiver and Amendments
