 WHEREAS, King County is developing the property at 401 5th Avenue for a new County Administration Building; and

 WHEREAS, the underground tunnel and covered pedestrian concourse would be a direct connection between the new King County garage and the new King County Administration Building; and

 WHEREAS, the concourse would provide overhead coverage for pedestrians and comply with ADA code requirements; and

 WHEREAS, the tunnel will connect to the concourse by stairs and/or elevator at the corner of Jefferson Street and 5th Avenue; and

 WHEREAS, the tunnel will provide a safe and secure pedestrian connection for visitors and King County employees to the King County campus using the garage and avoiding potential traffic conflicts on 5th Avenue; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to King County, its successors and assigns ("Permittee"), to maintain and operate a pedestrian tunnel under and across 5th Avenue south of Jefferson Street, and a concourse under and across the alleyway south of Jefferson Street between 5th and 6th Avenues.

 Section 2. The permission hereby granted ("to the Permitee") is for a term of ten (10) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation may renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms, provided further that the total term of the Permit as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City") by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.

 Section 3. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the tunnel and concourse at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) the City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the tunnel and concourse is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that the tunnel and concourse interfere with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director of Transportation ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation is not corrected by the Permittee within thirty (30) days of written notification from the City.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 4. In the event that the permit is not renewed, or the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the tunnel and concourse pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the tunnel and concourse and shall place all portions of the alley that may have been disturbed for any part of the tunnel and concourse, in as good condition for public use as it was prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 5. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the tunnels except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director, in his/her judgment, may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the tunnels at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the tunnels, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally-owned public utilities.

 Section 6. After notice to the Permittee, and failure of the Permittee to correct said unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order either or both tunnel and concourse closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 7. Not withstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the tunnel and concourse, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 (a) the tunnel and concourse and all its equipment and property are removed from the street; and

 (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and

 (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided,

 that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove the tunnel and concourse and its property and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 8. The tunnels shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with The City of Seattle, to at all times protect and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to or be suffered by any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said tunnels, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its

 successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 (a) The City, its agents, contractors or employees;

 (b) The Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns,

 this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 9. For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until both tunnels are entirely removed from their location as described in Section 1 or until discharged by order of the Director of Seattle Transportation as provided in Section 7 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which protect the City from any and all claims and risks in conjunction with:

 (a) Reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use or existence of the tunnel and concourse permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of the tunnel and concourse;

 (b) The Permittee's activity upon or the use or occupation of the area described in Section 1 of this ordinance, as well as;

 (c) Any and all claims and risks in conjunction with any activity performed by the Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance. Minimum insurance requirements shall be an occurrence form policy of commercial general liability, placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State. Minimum policy limits shall be $2,000,000 per occurrence, $4,000,000 annual aggregate. Coverage shall specifically name the tunnels' exposure. Coverage shall add by endorsement The City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insured's Clause indicating essentially that "except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part to the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought." Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a copy of the full insurance policy with all endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit. Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of The City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Permittee may carry insurance of the kind required under the ordinance under a blanket insurance policy or policies which cover other properties owned or operated by Permittee, in addition to the premises or may self-insure against the perils covered by such insurance. Permittee shall provide a letter from Permittee's Risk Manager, acceptable to the City Risk Manager, setting forth Permittee's insurance program. Whenever in the judgment of the City's Risk Manager, such insurance/self-insurance shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the Permittee shall upon demand by the City Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance as may be specified by the City Risk Manager to bring Permittee into compliance with the insurance provisions of this ordinance.

 Section 10. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work on the premises as contemplated by this permit, name The City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract

 documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to Wells Fargo Bank to the City as well.

 Section 11. Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance the Permittee shall deliver to the Director of Transportation for filing with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond in the sum of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) for each tunnel executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington, conditioned that the Permittee will comply with each and every provision of this ordinance and with each and every order of the Director pursuant thereto; provided, that if in the Mayor of the City of Seattle in his/her judgment shall deem any bond or bonds filed to be insufficient and demand a new or additional bond, the Permittee shall furnish a new or additional bond in such amount as the Mayor may specify to be necessary to fully protect the City. Said bond shall remain in effect until such time as the tunnels are entirely removed from their location as described in Section 1, or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 7 of this ordinance.

 Section 12. The Permittee, its successors and assigns shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumber any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance. The permission conferred by this ordinance shall not be assignable or transferable by operation of law.

 Section 13. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment in conjunction with the design, architectural engineering work, or the reconstruction, repair or maintenance of the tunnels permitted pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry, age,

 national origin or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification. The foregoing commitment shall be implemented as follows:

 (a) The Permittee will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, religion, creed, color, sex, national origin or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training, including apprenticeship;

 (b) The Permittee shall post in conspicuous places available to such employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non-discrimination clause;

 (c) the Permittee shall furnish to the Director of Human Rights or a successor official, upon his or her request and on such forms as may be provided, a report of the affirmative action taken in implementing this provision and will permit reasonable access to its records for the purposes of determining compliance with this Section. If, upon investigation the Director of Human Rights finds probable cause to believe that the Permittee has failed to comply with any of the terms of this Section, the Permittee and the Director of Transportation will be notified in writing. The Director of Transportation shall give Permittee at least ten (10) days notice and a hearing thereon. If the Director of Transportation finds that there has been a violation of this Section, he or she may suspend the permission conferred pending full compliance with the terms of this Section. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this provision shall be a material violation of this ordinance.

 The foregoing paragraphs shall be inserted in any subcontracts for work undertaken pursuant to this ordinance in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the reconstruction, repair or maintenance of the tunnels permitted to be maintained hereunder, unless the Director of Human Rights authorizes the use of another equality of employment opportunity provision.

 Section 14. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Transportation within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed

 declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 15. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
