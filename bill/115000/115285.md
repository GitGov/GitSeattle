 Attachment 1 -- RIGHTS-OF-WAY AGREEMENT: LOWERED AURORA AND PROJECTS AFFECTING LOT 2

 Exhibit A to Attachment 1 - Diagram of Property Additions

 (Ver. 2)

 Attachment 1

 RIGHTS-OF-WAY AGREEMENT:

 LOWERED AURORA AND PROJECTS AFFECTING LOT 2

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation conducted a region- wide search for a site with sufficient acreage to enable it to construct over time a multi-structure campus sufficient to accommodate a headquarters facility for many decades to come; and

 WHEREAS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation evaluated numerous sites within the City of Seattle (the "City"), including the Seattle Center 5th Avenue Parking Lot ("Lot 2") and several multi-block sites in nearby proximity to the Lot 2 site; and

 WHEREAS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has told the City that it responded to the City's proposal of making the Lot 2 site available for purchase and that it selected the Lot 2 site for location of its world headquarters because, among other reasons, the Lot 2 site was the only available site with sufficient contiguous acreage not currently transected by public streets; and

 WHEREAS, during negotiation of the Purchase Agreement for acquisition of Lot 2 by IRIS Holdings, LLC ("IRIS"), a wholly-owned entity of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle Center representatives presented a proposal for substantial transportation improvements in the vicinity of the site. The Mayor's proposal involved the lowering of Aurora Avenue, including widening of the right-of-way for ramps, the extension of Sixth Avenue between Mercer and Harrison Streets, and the reconnection of east-west streets across Aurora, including Republican Street from Dexter Avenue to the extended Sixth Avenue ("Lot 2 Street Extensions). The Mayor's proposal also required vacation of Broad Street between Ninth Avenue and Harrison or Thomas Street ("Broad Street Vacation"); and,

 WHEREAS, on January 10, 2005, just prior to submittal of the proposed Purchase Agreement to the City Council for review and approval, the City Council adopted Resolution 30726 declaring a preferred alternative for the Alaska Way Viaduct and Seawall Project, a feature of which is the so-called Lowered Aurora option that contemplates the Lot 2 Street Extensions and the Broad Street Vacation (collectively, the "Project Affecting Lot 2"). The issue also was raised during City Council consideration of the Lot 2 Purchase Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, in order to address the Project Affecting Lot 2 as an item during due diligence following execution of the Purchase Agreement, Ordinance 121742provides that "(p)rior to the end of the 90 day Due Diligence Period provided for in Section 4 of the Purchase Agreement, the Mayor shall transmit legislation to the City Council for its review and approval of an agreement acceptable to the City and to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation addressing potential impacts and consequences of the City's possible acquisition of street rights of way for a Sixth Avenue extension through Lot 2 [the "Project Affecting Lot 2"]. As provided in Section 5 of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement shall terminate unless a Council- approved agreement acceptable to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is executed before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, as extended. Notwithstanding the preceding, IRIS may at any time during the Due Diligence Period approve or waive all Diligence Period Conditions and proceed to close; and

 WHEREAS, since enactment of Ordinance 121742, IRIS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have continued their evaluation of the prospects for the Project Affecting Lot 2 as proposed and the potential impacts such extensions and vacations may have for utilization of the Lot 2 site for the headquarters of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; and

 WHEREAS, while it remains uncertain whether the measures included in the Project Affecting Lot 2 would be undertaken by the City, or if they were, when that might occur, the City is willing to establish a date certain by which the City will notify IRIS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of its intent to initiate further actions to implement the Project Affecting Lot 2 and IRIS is willing to defer construction in the potential rights-of-way required for the Lot 2 Street Extensions and undertake other actions in consideration for the City's commitments provided for in this agreement (the "Agreement"); and,

 WHEREAS, if the City proceeds to extend/vacate the streets as proposed, such extensions/vacations will have a material impact on the Lot 2 site, potentially substantially altering the plans of IRIS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Although the extent of that impact is not determinable at this time, such potential damage would be fully compensated and mitigated as provided herein by the City at such time as it acquires rights-of-way for the Lot 2 Street Extensions and undertakes the Broad Street Vacation; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the Lot 2 site is encumbered until September 30, 2010 by the lease to the Basketball Club of Seattle for the Sonics and Storm Practice Facility ("Practice Facility") and by an easement for access to the Practice Facility; and

 WHEREAS, certain measures may enable the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make effective use of the Lot 2 site for its headquarters notwithstanding the impacts of the Project Affecting Lot 2; and

 WHEREAS, the City and IRIS are entering this Agreement with a goal that IRIS be able to develop its campus for the headquarters of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the same extent and with the same density as if the Project Affecting Lot 2 had not occurred.

 NOW, THEREFORE, as provided under Section 4 of Ordinance 121742 authorizing the sale of Lot 2 to IRIS, the City and IRIS (the "Parties") hereby agree as follows:

 Section 1. Approval/Waiver of Due Diligence Conditions. IRIS hereby approves or waives all of the due diligence conditions under Section 5 of the Purchase Agreement precedent to its obligation to purchase the Lot 2 site (the "Property").

 Section 2. Lot 2 Street Extensions and Broad Street Vacation - Project Affecting Lot 2. IRIS hereby agrees to include, and evaluate, in the environmental review documents for development of the campus on the Property, a development option based upon a reconfigured campus site that allows for the Lot 2 Street Extensions and the Broad Street Vacation. This development option incorporating the Project Affecting Lot 2 shall include the Property Additions that the City would propose to be provided in whole or partial exchange for the Lot 2 Street Extensions, as described in Section 4 below, and shall be based upon the design characteristics of Sixth Avenue, as described in Section 5 below.

 Section 3. Limit on Construction within the Rights-of-Way Required for the Lot 2 Street Extensions. IRIS hereby agrees to defer construction of permanent improvements, which improvements do not include the relocation of utilities as the Parties may agree, within the IRIS-owned rights-of-way required for the Lot 2 Street Extensions until the earlier of the following dates (the "Deferral Termination Date"):

 (a) Notice to IRIS by the City that the City is no longer contemplating the Project Affecting Lot 2; or,

 (b) September 30, 2010.

 If the City provides notice to IRIS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation prior to September 30, 2010 that the Mayor will recommend the approval of the Broad Street Vacation to the City Council in order to implement the Project Affecting Lot 2, the Parties agree to enter into good faith negotiation of an agreement to convey the IRIS- owned rights-of-way required to implement the Project Affecting Lot 2 and to proceed with commitments under Section 4 below. The giving of such notice by the City, if applicable, shall extend the Deferral Termination Date to the later of September 30, 2010 or 90 days from the date of such notice, or such later date as may be agreed in writing by the Parties. Upon the Deferral Termination Date (as may be extended), IRIS's agreement to defer construction as set forth in this section shall automatically terminate.

 The City acknowledges that, during the time period limiting construction within the Rights-of-Way required for the Lot 2 Street Extensions or as a result of lease and access encumbrances on some of the Property required for Lot 2 Street Extensions, IRIS may identify one or more development options contemplating construction of permanent improvements within such rights-of-way as an alternative under the environmental review documents for development of the Property and seek and obtain permits for such future development options. The City shall not withhold or delay the processing of permit application(s) for such development options.

 Section 4. Property Additions. The Parties concur that it is possible that the impact of the Project Affecting Lot 2 could be mitigated in whole or in part by conveyance to IRIS of two parcels of land adjacent to the Property that would become available to the City, as part of the proposed vacation and elimination of Broad Street between Aurora Avenue and Harrison Street, in the event the City proceeds with the contemplated Project Affecting Lot 2. These parcels are identified diagrammatically on Exhibit A (the "Property Additions").

 (a) The Parties agree that, in the event the City notifies IRIS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as provided for in Section 3 above, or otherwise determines to proceed with the contemplated Project Affecting Lot 2, the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation (or that person's functional successor) shall, upon such notice, promptly prepare, and the Mayor shall recommend to the City Council, legislation authorizing the Broad Street Vacation and conveyance of the Property Additions to IRIS in whole or partial exchange for the IRIS property proposed to be acquired by the City.

 (b) Consideration to be paid to IRIS for the taking or dedication, including compensation for the value of the land acquired as well as other damages IRIS may experience as a result of the impact of the takings on facilities it may have constructed on the Property and its ability to achieve its fundamental objective in acquiring the Property, shall be reduced by the fair market value of the Property Additions conveyed.

 (c) In the event that the City Council does not approve vacation of Broad Street adjacent to the Property or take any other discretionary actions necessary to allow for conveyance to IRIS of the Property Additions in whole or partial exchange for the IRIS property proposed to be acquired by the City, as contemplated herein, the City agrees not to proceed with the Lot 2 Street Extensions through the Property.

 Section 5. Sixth Avenue Design Characteristics. If the Project Affecting Lot 2 goes forward, with the result that the City reacquires the Lot 2 Street Extensions, the City agrees to mitigate, in consultation with IRIS, and at the City's expense (without offset against proceeds due IRIS for any taking), the impacts of the Project Affecting Lot 2 in part by designing Sixth Avenue through the Property (between Mercer and Harrison Streets) to have the following characteristics:

 (a) Sixth Avenue will be a "neighborhood" arterial street providing one of a number of options for traffic traveling to or through the area. Sixth Avenue will become part of an enhanced street grid that will serve to spread traffic out rather than concentrating all traffic in one particular corridor.

 (b) The design of Sixth Avenue will also reflect the City's land use planning goals and objectives to transform South Lake Union and Uptown urban centers into denser, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, well served by transit. Traffic speed on Sixth Avenue would be calmed by a speed limit likely to be 30 MPH (similar to other streets in the neighborhood); by signalized intersections and pedestrian crosswalks on each block through the area.

 (c) The design of Sixth Avenue will also allow for accommodation of a pedestrian skybridge over Sixth Avenue, at IRIS expense, to connect parcels of the Property that would be bisected by the proposed Sixth Avenue extension.

 (d) The Sixth Avenue right-of -way from Mercer Street to Harrison Street will be a maximum of 80' in width, with the center line of the street located at the center line of vacated Sixth Avenue; this is a transitional width between the somewhat narrower right of way on Sixth Avenue north of Mercer Street and the somewhat wider right of way on Sixth Avenue south of Harrison Street.

 (e) A maximum of four through travel lanes total (two northbound and two southbound) will be provided on Sixth Avenue between Mercer Street and Harrison Street. Left turn pockets may be included at intersections.

 (f) At the time of construction of Sixth Avenue, signalized intersections will be provided at Sixth Avenue and Mercer Street, Sixth Avenue and Republican Street, and Sixth Avenue and Harrison Street.

 (g) Sixth Avenue will be designed as a pedestrian-friendly "downtown" street. Wide sidewalks (10' minimum) will be provided on both sides of the street, with street trees and lighting. At the time of construction of Sixth Avenue, signalized crosswalks will be provided, at minimum, on the south side of the Sixth Avenue and Mercer Street intersection, on both north and south sides of the Sixth Avenue and Republican Street intersection, and the north and south sides of the Sixth Avenue and Harrison Street intersection.

 (h) As the principal property owner adjacent to proposed Sixth Avenue extension, IRIS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will be fully consulted on the actual street design and will have the opportunity to fund additional amenities beyond those identified above (such as a pedestrian skybridge) that enhance the neighborhood character of Sixth Avenue and circulation and access to and among the parcels of the Property as may be altered as a result of this Agreement.

 Section 6. Relocation of Electrical Utilities. It is IRIS's desire in the development of the Property to relocate electrical utilities currently serving or traversing the Property, on a permanent basis, to the perimeter of the Property, either above or underground, at IRIS's expense. IRIS recognizes that electrical utilities presently serving or traversing the Property have a right of easement for continued service.

 (a) In the event that permanent relocation of some or all electrical utilities currently traversing or presently serving the Property are required by the City, solely in order to implement the Project Affecting Lot 2, to be located in the Sixth Avenue Right of Way, the expense of relocating such affected lines shall be at the cost and discretion of the City; provided, that, IRIS may elect to have the City locate underground any electrical utilities that would not otherwise be located underground and pay the additional incremental cost of doing so.

 (b) In the event that the Project Affecting Lot 2 includes a proposal to relocate electrical utilities not currently traversing or presently serving the Property in the Sixth Avenue Right of Way, and the City proceeds with the Lot 2 Street Extensions, the City agrees that such electrical utilities shall be located underground, that such utilities shall not be relocated at IRIS's expense, and that such utilities shall only be relocated in the Sixth Avenue Right of Way if there is sufficient space to include both the electrical utilities currently traversing or presently serving the Property and the electrical utilities not currently traversing or presently serving the Property.

 (c) The Parties acknowledge that if certain electrical utility transmission and distribution lines currently traversing the Property and/or currently located in Broad Street are relocated under the Property and the Property Additions as a consequence of the Project Affecting Lot 2 and the Broad Street Vacation, the City will require up to a 60-foot wide easement along Harrison Street within the approximate area of the Property and the Property Additions diagrammatically shown on Exhibit A to accommodate the underground installation and that for the duration of such easement, IRIS' improvements on the easement area will be limited to landscaping and minor hardscape installation.

 Section 7. Good Faith Intent of the Parties. This Agreement is being entered into between the City and IRIS based on information known as of the execution date as a result of initial conceptual design of the Lowered Aurora Project (Exhibit B) and the Project Affecting Lot 2. Should the Project Affecting Lot 2 proceed as represented herein, the Parties expect that this Agreement will facilitate a fair value exchange between the Parties for impacts of the Project Affecting Lot 2 on the IRIS-owned Property that will serve as the headquarters for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Parties acknowledge, however, that should the Project Affecting Lot 2 proceed, the actual impacts will be determined based upon the final project design, and the fair value exchange will be quantified and agreed upon at that time. It is the intent of the City to honor the goal of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to be able to develop the campus for its headquarters to the same extent and with the same density as if the Project Affecting Lot 2 had not occurred.

 Section 8. Representations and Warranties.

 (a) The City. The City hereby represents and warrants that it has full and complete power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, including full and complete power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under the agreements contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and has obtained an opinion from the City's law department to such effect.
