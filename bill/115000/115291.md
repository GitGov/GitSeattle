PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT  FOR SALE OF REAL PROPERTY

 THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of __________________, 2005, between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a first class city of the State of Washington ("Seller"), and WARREN AVENUE PROPERTIES, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Purchaser").

 In consideration of the payment and receipt of the Purchase Price in exchange for the Property, and in reliance on the parties' mutual promises and undertakings and the mutual benefits to be derived from the promises contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 1. PROPERTY AND INTERESTS.

 1.1 Seller owns the real property and improvements described on Exhibit A and depicted on the site map as Exhibit B (the "Property"), and Seller has determined with the advice of the Seattle Center Director that the current public use of the Property as a surface parking lot is no longer needed, and that the Property is not necessary for Seattle Center's future program needs. The term "Property" includes all existing appurtenant easements, development rights, permits, warranties, license and tangible property.

 2. SALE OF PROPERTY.

 2.1 Upon execution of this Agreement by the duly authorized representatives of Purchaser and Seller, and upon payment of the Purchase Price defined in Section 3.1, Seller shall convey the Property to Purchaser subject to: (a) all taxes, assessments, restrictions, easements, agreements and other matters affecting the Property deemed acceptable by Purchaser; and (b) all applicable zoning rules, restrictions, regulations, resolutions and ordinances and building restrictions and governmental regulations now or hereafter in effect. The parties recognize that this Agreement is subject to approval by the Seattle City Council.

 3. PURCHASE PRICE.

 3.1 Purchase Price. The total purchase price for the Property ("Purchase Price") is Eight Hundred Ninety Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($890,000). The Purchase Price, less the Earnest Money and all accrued interest, shall be paid in cash at Closing.

 3.2 Earnest Money. Within five (5) business days after full execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver to the downtown Seattle office of Chicago Title Insurance Company ("Title Company"), 701 5th Avenue, Suite 1800, or such other escrow agent as may be satisfactory to both Purchaser and Seller ("Escrow Agent"), an earnest money deposit (the "Earnest Money") in an amount equal to five percent of the Purchase Price, or Forty Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($44,500) by wire transfer or check, which sum shall be deposited in an interest bearing account and held until Closing and which sum (together with all accrued interest thereon) shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing, unless forfeited or refunded to Purchaser as provided in this Agreement.

 4. TITLE, SURVEY, AND INSPECTIONS; LEASES.

 4.1 Title. Closing shall be conditioned upon Title Company issuing or committing to issue to Purchaser, at Purchaser's election, a standard or extended coverage ALTA owner's policy of title insurance in the amount of the Purchase Price (the "Title Policy"). The Title Policy shall insure that title to the Property is free and clear of all encumbrances except those listed in the title commitment and not objected to by Purchaser, which exceptions shall be the "Permitted Exceptions". The lien for any current real property taxes not yet due and payable, and those matters excluded from coverage by the standard exceptions and exclusions contained in the form of title insurance policy required hereby are Permitted Exceptions. Title shall be conveyed by bargain and sale deed, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions. Within five (5) business days of executing this Agreement, Seller shall deliver a copy of the current title commitment ("Title Commitment") for the Property to Purchaser, along with legible and complete copies of all documents referenced as title exceptions in the Title Commitment.

 4.1.2 Purchaser shall have fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the Title Commitment to notify Seller of any objections Purchaser has to the condition of title. If Purchaser provides no such notice within the fifteen (15) business day period, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have no objections to the condition of title. Seller shall have ten (10) business days after receipt of Purchaser's objections, if any, to notify Purchaser whether Seller will remove the exceptions objected to by Purchaser. If Seller provides no such notice within the ten (10) business day period, then Seller shall be deemed to agree to remove all of the exceptions objected to by Purchaser prior to Closing.

 4.1.3 In the event that Seller provides notice that it will not remove all exceptions objected to by Purchaser prior to Closing, and the Parties cannot agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price and/or other terms of this Agreement, then within ten (10) business days of notice by Seller of Seller's intent not to remove one or more of the exceptions, Purchaser may, at its sole option:

 (i) Notify Seller of Purchaser's intent to waive any exceptions which Seller has not agreed to remove and accept title to the Property subject to such exceptions, or

 (ii) Terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent, in which event this Agreement shall terminate, the Earnest Money deposit and all interest earned thereon shall be promptly refunded to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement except as specifically provided otherwise.

 4.1.4 Cost of Title Report. In the event that this Agreement is terminated without closing, the cost of the title insurance contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Seller, unless the transaction terminates due to fault of Purchaser, in which case Purchaser shall bear the costs of title insurance.

 4.2 License for Entry onto Property for Inspection, Study and Survey Purposes; Documents. In general, as it applies to this Section and its subsections, Purchaser shall exercise its rights granted herein at all times in such a manner as shall not result in the Property becoming subject to any lien arising out of Purchaser's exercise of rights. Any lien arising out of Purchaser's conduct of any right granted under this Agreement shall be removed immediately and at Purchaser's expense.

 4.2.1 License. Seller grants to Purchaser and its agents, a license to enter the Property upon prior notice to Seller, who shall arrange such access as Purchaser shall reasonably require, for the purpose of conducting any investigation, inspection, analysis, study or survey of the Property. The time, place and manner of inspection shall be fully described to Seller prior to entry and no investigation, inspection, analysis, study or survey shall be made which has not been approved in advance by Seller or which unreasonably disturbs Seller's use and enjoyment of the Property. Seller shall not unreasonably withhold approval and shall endeavor to make access to the Property available for inspections. Purchaser shall promptly provide copies of any surveys, reports, analyses, etc., to Seller. The license granted in this Section shall expire on the date of Closing or the date this Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier.

 4.2.2 Environmental Reports. Within five (5) business days of the full execution of this Agreement, Seller shall furnish Purchaser with copies of all Environmental Reports and Hazardous Materials reports, along with any abatement or remediation bids or estimates received by Seller, and all other information in the possession of Seller which reflects conditions on the Property, including environmental conditions, or the potential for same, and which pertain to the condition and/or any present or potential development and/or use of the Property.

 (i) Prior to expiration of the Due Diligence Period (as defined in Section 6.1.3), Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, to commence any investigation of the Property, including but not limited to such environmental studies as it deems necessary to determine that the Property is free from Hazardous Materials. Seller shall have the right to approve any investigation or testing of the Property prior to it actually taking place; provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In general, all such investigations or studies occurring on the premises shall not interfere with Seller's use of the Property, shall be conducted in a manner consistent with best practices of the industry, and shall not expose any person to any condition potentially hazardous to that person's health. In the event that any accidental discharge or exposure of a hazardous condition should occur, Purchaser and its agents shall promptly take all steps reasonably calculated to minimize the effect of such exposure, and protect life, health and property and shall promptly notify Seller. Purchaser shall notify Seller of the results of any studies it conducts.

 (ii) Any environmental study which Purchaser elects to undertake which requires invasive or destructive testing may be performed upon 5 business days' notice to Seller and upon proof of insurance adequate to the risk of damage or loss occurring during the testing to cover the cost of repair necessitated by such testing on the Property or any adjacent property owned by Seller.

 (iii) Any invasive or destructive testing shall be conducted at an agreed time, and in a manner intended to minimize disruption to Seller's use of the Property. In the event that this Agreement terminates without Closing, Purchaser covenants and agrees to repair any damage to the Property occasioned by Purchaser's entry upon the Property or the conduct of any inspection, study or survey by or for Purchaser; provided however that Purchaser shall not be required to correct any conditions of the Property related to the presence of Hazardous Materials. Such repair shall be to the condition in which the Property existed immediately prior to Purchaser's initial entry upon the Property pursuant to the license granted herein. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any costs, loss or damage whatsoever incurred as a result of Purchaser's entry upon the Property and conduct of the inspection, study or survey.

 4.2.3 Seller's Cooperation. Seller agrees that Seller and its employees will cooperate with Purchaser during Purchaser's investigation and survey and provide such access to the Property and such information about the Property as Purchaser shall reasonably require. In addition, Seller agrees that within five (5) business days after full execution of this Agreement, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a complete copy of the following to the extent they are in Seller's possession, custody or control: information relating to any proposal or commitment by Seller to alter existing improvements or structures or construct additional improvements or structures, or to dedicate any portion of the Property to any governmental entity; and all other reports, records, diagrams, photographs, maps or other Documents relating to the Property, as listed at Exhibit C attached hereto.

 4.3 Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any claims, costs (including attorney's fees), loss, liability and damage whatsoever incurred as a result of Purchaser's entry upon the Property and conduct of the inspection, study or survey or any other activity on the Property by or on behalf of Purchaser in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement. Any damages not repaired to Seller's satisfaction shall be assessed against the Earnest Money in the event the sale does not close. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as provided in Section 5.2.4, Purchaser's repair, defense and indemnification obligations under this Section shall not extend to the correction of any preexisting condition that Purchaser discovers to be present on, under or about the Property.

 4.4 Seller Cooperation in Approvals Process. Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in its pursuit of approvals from City of Seattle and other applicable authorities with jurisdiction over building and site improvement permitting and approvals, both pre- Closing and post-Closing, in connection with Purchaser's development project; provided, however, that Closing is specifically not contingent on City approval of a Master Use Permit or any other permits.

 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

 5.1 Purchaser's Warranties. Purchaser represents and warrants as follows:

 5.1.1 Purchaser is a Washington limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Washington.

 5.1.2 The purchase of the Property will not conflict with or result in a material breach affecting Purchaser's ability to perform under this Agreement, of any other agreement or instrument to which Purchaser is a party or by which it is or may be bound or constitute a default under any of the foregoing, or violate any state or federal governmental law, statute, ordinance or regulation in effect on the date of execution of this Agreement.

 5.1.3 Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Property is being sold AS IS, WHERE IS, and that Seller makes no warranties or representations concerning the condition of the Property, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, or its suitability for Purchaser's purposes.

 5.2.2 Seller is aware of no condition on or affecting the title to the Property, including but not limited to any material defect or material adverse fact relating to the Property, which will not be reflected as a matter of record title and will not be disclosed to Purchaser at the time Seller provides Purchaser the Documents listed in Exhibit C.

If any additional Hazardous Material is discovered by Purchaser on the Property prior to Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. However, if Purchaser does not terminate prior to Closing, then effective upon Closing, Purchaser waives, releases, acquits and forever discharges Seller from any and all liability for the environmental condition of the Property.

There is no pending condemnation or similar proceeding affecting the Property or any portion thereof, and Seller has not received any notice and has no knowledge that any such proceeding is contemplated.

 5.2.6 There are no contracts, leases or other agreements which affect the Property or any portion thereof which would survive Closing, and Seller agrees not to enter into any such contracts, leases or other agreements, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing.

 5.2.7 Other than as expressly disclosed by Seller to Purchaser in the Documents, the Property does not violate any applicable environmental, zoning, or building restrictions, insurance company guidelines, fire codes, or other governmental statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations or orders relating to health, safety or welfare or any orders by any governmental agency or known insurance company requiring corrective action for any of the foregoing.

 5.2.8 No representation or warranty by Seller contained in this Agreement or any exhibit hereto or in any document, statement, certificate, financial information, or schedule given to or to be given to Purchaser as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, knowingly contains or on Closing knowingly will contain, an untrue statement of material fact, or knowingly omits or on Closing will knowingly omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements and facts contained therein not misleading.

 5.2.11 The representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement are true on and as of the date of Closing as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of Closing.

 5.3 Purchaser's Understanding of the Property. Unless Purchaser terminates this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, Purchaser agrees that it will accept the Property "AS IS" at Closing. Purchaser acknowledges that:

Seller shall work diligently and in good faith to secure City Council passage and Mayoral approval of the Ordinance. If the Ordinance is not passed by the City Council or approved by the Mayor, or it is passed or approved with conditions or changes deemed unacceptable to Purchaser, in Purchaser's sole discretion, or the approved Ordinance is appealed, then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent, in which event this Agreement shall terminate, the Earnest Money deposit and all accrued interest shall be promptly refunded to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement.

 6.1.6 The representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement are true on and as of the date of Closing with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of Closing.

Any documentary transfer tax, real estate excise tax, or other similar tax in accordance with the requirements of lawful authority shall be paid by Seller. Seller shall pay the premium for the issuance of a standard owner's title insurance policy to be issued to Purchaser at Closing, provided, however, that Purchaser shall pay the cost of extended (ALTA) coverage as well as any additional endorsement premiums. All other recording and closing costs (including the escrow fee and expenses associated therewith) shall be the responsibility of Purchaser. Each party shall pay its own attorneys' fees, costs and expenses with respect to the negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.

 10.5 At Closing, the Escrow Agent shall have the Title Company issue to Purchaser the Title Policy insuring fee simple title to the Property subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.

 11. DEFAULT.

 11.1 If either party to this Agreement shall fail or refuse to perform or satisfy a material obligation under this Agreement and the other party has performed all of its obligations under this Agreement, then the party who has failed or refused to perform shall be in default and the non-defaulting party may elect from the following remedies.

 11.1.1 Seller in Default.

 11.1.2 Purchaser in Default. In the event that Purchaser fails to close this transaction without legal excuse, Seller may retain the Earnest Money deposit together with accrued interest as liquidated damages as Seller's sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall terminate and Seller shall have no further rights and Purchaser shall have no further obligations under this Agreement.

 SELLER INITIALS: _________

 12.2 Risk of Loss. Risk of loss or damage to the Property by fire or other casualty, from the date of this Agreement through Closing shall be on Seller, and thereafter shall be on Purchaser.

Alternatively, Purchaser may elect to take title to the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement without reduction of the Purchase Price and shall be entitled to receive from the Superior Governmental Authority any condemnation award or benefit. If Purchaser purchases the Property and complies with all of the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall assign to Purchaser all of its right, title and interest in and to any such condemnation award or benefit, if any, that may be owing to the owner of the Property as a result of such condemnation or taking of, or damage or change to the Property, provided, however, that in such event, Seller's warranties, other than as to the condition of title to the Property, shall lapse.

 14. BROKERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

 14.1 Purchaser and Seller each warrant and represent that they will each be solely responsible for any and all commissions due their respective real estate broker, salesman, finder or similar intermediary in connection with the purchase of the Property, and each shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend the other from and against any claim based on any alleged fact inconsistent with such party's warranty and representation contained in this paragraph 14.1. Seller is represented by Metropolitan Partners. Purchaser represents that it has not been represented by any broker in connection with the purchase of the Property. This indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing and the termination of this Agreement.

 15. ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT.

 15.1 This Agreement may be assigned by Purchaser subject to approval by Seller which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may assign this Agreement at Closing to any entity in which Purchaser has a 51% or greater ownership interest, without Seller's consent.

 15.2 Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon each party and its assigns and successors.
