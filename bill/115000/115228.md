 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Cedar River Watershed; authorizing an "ecological thinning" project, in accordance with the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), in Sections 27, 28, 33 and 34, Township 22, North, Range 9, East, W.M.; declaring the logs resulting from said project to be surplus to the City's needs; authorizing the sale of such logs pursuant to applicable City contracting and surplus property sale procedures; and directing deposit of the proceeds therefrom to the Water Fund for the purposes of the HCP implementation.

 WHEREAS, in 1999, following several years of technical studies, negotiations with federal and state agencies and review by public groups and individuals, the City Council adopted Resolution 29977 authorizing the Mayor to submit the Final HCP and other related documents for federal review and issuance of an "incidental take permit" under the federal Endangered Species Act, and to execute on behalf of the City the HCP and related agreements, which together establish the City's long-term commitments regarding watershed habitat protection and mitigation for impacts resulting from the presence and operation of certain City-owned facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the HCP describes, among other subjects, the City's planned forest management practices, including the use of "ecological thinning" to accelerate development of old-growth conditions, improve habitat for species dependent on older forest, and control risks of catastrophic events in certain existing densely-stocked second-growth stands; and

 WHEREAS, in 2000, the City received the incidental take permit and executed the HCP and related agreements; and

 WHEREAS, in 2002, the City Council passed Ordinance 121040, which clarified certain differences between the forest management policies contained in the Secondary Use Policies (adopted by Ordinance 114632) and those contained in the HCP; prohibited the harvesting of trees for commercial purposes on City-owned land within the Watershed; authorized the cutting of trees for certain limited non-commercial reasons (including ecological thinning); provided limited authority for the sale of logs resulting from such non-commercial cutting; and dedicated the proceeds from such sales for the purpose of offsetting the costs of the HCP; and

 WHEREAS, in 2002, the City Council passed Ordinance 121039, which authorized the first ecological thinning project under the HCP, which was completed in 2003; and

 WHEREAS, following field surveys and other technical considerations, Seattle Public Utilities staff have recommended for the second ecological thinning project under the HCP a second-growth stand located in Sections 27, 28, 33 and 34, Township 22, North, Range 9 East, W.M., and consisting of approximately 477 acres, of which approximately 358 acres will receive ecological thinning treatment; and

 WHEREAS, this planned ecological thinning project is estimated to result in approximately 2,800,000 board feet of merchantable logs, among the vegetation that would be cut; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to contract, pursuant to applicable City contracting or surplus property sale procedures, and subject to the right of first refusal granted to Mountain Tree Farm Company by the 1962 Cedar River Watershed Cooperative Agreement, for the service of ecological thinning of a second-growth forest stand located in Sections 27, 28, 33 and 34, Township 22 North, Range 9 East, W.M., and consisting of approximately 477 acres, of which approximately 358 acres will receive ecological thinning treatment under the principles and procedures described in the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), which contract may provide for the sale and removal of merchantable logs down as a result of such ecological thinning. A public hearing having been held, the logs resulting from the ecological thinning project authorized by this ordinance are hereby declared to be surplus to the City's needs. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is further authorized to conduct all related monitoring, surveys, and other such activities as may be required by the City's commitments in the HCP and by applicable permit requirements.

 Section 2. All proceeds from the sale of logs authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance shall be deposited in the Water Fund (43000) and further dedicated for the exclusive purpose of offsetting the costs of implementing the HCP, including the projects, programs and activities described in the HCP documents and those that educate the public about them.
