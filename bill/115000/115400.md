 AN ORDINANCE declaring an emergency and authorizing an opportunity for eligible City of Seattle employees to convert up to a total of 40 hours of accumulated and unused vacation to cash to benefit the relief efforts on behalf of victims of Hurricane Katrina, by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Gulf Coast region of the South, including parts of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina; and

 WHEREAS, this storm and associated flooding has resulted in the death of hundreds and has caused thousands to be left homeless and without food, clothing, water, or other basics necessary for survival; and

 WHEREAS, the Governors of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi have each declared a state of emergency for their respective states; and

 WHEREAS, the Governor of Washington issued a proclamation of emergency in response to the states of emergency in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi to pave the way for Washington State and its political subdivisions, including the City of Seattle, to make expenditures and use resources on an emergency basis to come to the aid of the homeless, injured, and needy in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi; and

 WHEREAS, Hurricane Katrina and the resulting floods have damaged or destroyed more than 500 sewage-treatment plants in Louisiana and floodwaters have been found to contain high levels of human pollutants, raising the possibility for the outbreak of severe waterborne illness; and

 WHEREAS, Hurricane Katrina has damaged or destroyed oil refineries and other industrial plants, causing oil and other toxic material to spill into floodwaters and thus causing severe environmental damage and threatening human life; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle's Disaster Management Committee is developing a plan for the City's coordinated relief response to the disaster-stricken communities in the path of Hurricane Katrina; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Firefighters and Police Officers have been dispatched to assist with urban search and rescue efforts; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has asked City department directors to examine opportunities for City employees with specific skills to assist agencies with shelter management and logistical support, and to identify and create a citywide list of volunteers with necessary skills; and

 WHEREAS, the Hurricane Katrina relief effort is the largest ever required in the United States, and

 WHEREAS, the American Red Cross, Second Harvest, Northwest Medical Teams, Mercy Corps, Habitat for Humanity International and the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle are providing medical services, food, shelter and other support to relief efforts associated with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle employees are eager and willing to support this relief effort; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor of the City of Seattle hereby declares that Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath have created an emergency that requires action from state and local governments from around the country. The interstate Emergency Management Assistance Compact encourages assistance to stricken areas across jurisdictions and immediate assistance is needed.

 Section 2. The American Red Cross, Second Harvest, Northwest Medical Teams, Mercy Corps and Habitat for Humanity International are recognized charitable organizations that have provided support for a wide range of relief efforts domestically and worldwide, and are currently providing substantial support to the relief efforts associated with the effects and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in the states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, on behalf of a coalition of local African American organizations, is coordinating and providing support to victims who relocate to the Puget Sound region in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. These agencies are hereby identified as appropriate agencies to receive voluntary contributions from City of Seattle employees who wish to participate in the vacation conversion opportunity provided by this ordinance.

 Section 3. Employees who earn vacation under Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.34 and are otherwise eligible may voluntarily authorize payment of a cash amount equivalent to no less than one and no more than 20 hours of accumulated and unused vacation in one-hour increments and to designate that such cash shall be forwarded by the City to the one of the agencies identified in Section 2 for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts during the fourth quarter of 2005. Eligible employees may also voluntarily authorize payment of a cash amount equivalent to no less than one and no more than 20 hours of accumulated and unused vacation in one-hour increments and to designate that such cash shall be forwarded by the City to one of the agencies identified in Section 2 for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts during the first quarter of 2006; provided that the combined total contribution may not exceed 40 hours of vacation.

 1. The amount of vacation donated by any eligible and participating employee shall be converted to cash at the straight- time rate of pay in effect for the employee's regular position title, exclusive of premium, shift differential or longevity payment, at the time of donation.

 2. The cash resulting from converted vacation hours shall be transmitted by the Director of Executive Administration to the designated agencies specifically for use in the relief efforts related to Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent storm surge.

 3. Participating employees' accumulated and unused vacation balances shall be reduced by the number of hours designated for conversion to cash, not to exceed a total of 40 hours for both donation opportunities.

 Section 4. Department heads shall authorize the use of unexpended dollars in the appropriate budget control levels to cover the cost of cash donations resulting from the conversion of vacation hours by individuals in their employ.

 Section 5. The Mayor may enter into such agreements or modifications to existing collective bargaining agreements as are necessary to implement the purpose of this ordinance.

 Section 6. Because of the facts stated above, including the large number of persons without the basic necessities for survival and the immediate danger of disease and illness caused by waterborne pollutants, an emergency is declared to exist under Seattle City Charter Article 4, Section I. It is necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety that this ordinance become effective without delay. This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its passage by a three-fourths vote of the City Council and its approval by the Mayor.
