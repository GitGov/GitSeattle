 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Chinatown-International District Public Development Authority; authorizing the City to provide a guaranty in support of bonds to be issued by the Authority, establishing the terms and conditions under which the City will provide such guaranty; and authorizing an agreement and such related documents and agreements as are necessary between the City and the Authority with regard to the Authority's issuance of the bonds and the City's guaranty.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Chinatown International District Public Development Authority (the "Authority") was chartered by the City pursuant to RCW Ch. 35.21 and Chapter 3.110 of the Seattle Municipal Code to "conserve and renew the unique cultural and ethnic integrity characteristic of the International District" in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority has developed land in the International District formerly occupied by Metro into a mixed-use facility known as "Village Square I"; and

 WHEREAS, Village Square I includes low-income assisted elderly housing, a small retail space component, and parking facilities, and provides offices for non-profit social and health service agencies; and

 WHEREAS, Village Square I benefits the International District, and the City of Seattle as a whole, by providing a facility for centralized Asian/Pacific resources for health care, mental health and social services, pre-school and childcare, employment and training, senior advocacy and supportive care and housing; by creating a combined multi-ethnic staffing pool of approximately 225 staff speaking 43 languages; and by allowing the agencies to redirect their resources from administrative costs to service, and provide more services at reduced cost; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority previously issued its Special Obligation Bonds, Series 1996, in an aggregate principal amount of not-to-exceed Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) (the "1996 Bonds") to finance a portion of the costs of acquisition of the site and development of Village Square I, and the City provided credit enhancement to the 1996 Bonds by guaranteeing their payment; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority can realize debt service savings by refunding the outstanding 1996 Bonds through the issuance of its Special Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2007 in the aggregate principal amount of not-to-exceed Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the "2007 Bonds"); and

 WHEREAS, the Authority and representatives of the City have negotiated a form of Bond Payment Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which the City would provide credit enhancement to the 2007 Bonds by guaranteeing their payment on substantially the same terms as the City provided credit enhancement to the 1996 Bonds; and

 WHEREAS, the rental payments from the social and health service agencies and the retail tenant of Village Square I, together with other revenues of the Authority, will provide sufficient funds for the repayment of the 2007 Bonds in the same manner as such revenues provided sufficient funds for the repayment of the 1996 Bonds; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council hereby makes the following findings:

 It is in the best interests of the City and its citizens for the Authority to refund its Special Obligation Bonds, Series 1996, issued to finance a portion of the cost of acquiring and developing Village Square I, to achieve debt service savings for the benefit of the Authority.

 The Authority, on its own, was unable to obtain financing to develop and construct Village Square I on terms and conditions that made it economically and financially feasible. The pledge by the City of its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the Authority's 1996 Bonds in an amount not to exceed Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) significantly reduced the costs of the Authority's financing for the Village Square I project and thereby enabled the Authority to meet its debt service requirements. The Authority, on its own, is unable to refund the 1996 Bonds to achieve debt service savings. The City's pledge of its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the Authority's 2007 Bonds in an amount not to exceed Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) would significantly reduce the interest cost of the 2007 Bonds, enabling the Authority to realize the debt service savings available as a result of refunding the 1996 Bonds. The Authority will derive funds for the repayment of the 2007 Bonds from payments under the leases of portions of Village Square I to retail and non-profit social and health service agencies and from other sources available to the Authority in the same manner as the Authority has derived funds for the repayment of the 1996 Bonds.

 The City Council concludes that the most appropriate method of assisting the Authority in furtherance of its public purpose is to pledge its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the 2007 Bonds issued by the Authority on substantially the same terms of the City pledged its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the 1996 Bonds. Such guaranty shall be provided in the manner hereinafter set forth in an agreement substantially in the form contained in Exhibit A hereto with such modifications as the Mayor may deem necessary and appropriate and which are consistent with this Ordinance. The City Council hereby further finds and declares that the City's provision of credit support and any expenditure of public funds to assist in the refinancing of costs the Village Square I project are for a public and strictly municipal purpose.

 Section 2. Authorization to execute agreements. The Mayor is authorized to execute on behalf of the City an agreement with the Authority substantially in the form contained in Exhibit A hereto. The Mayor is further authorized to execute such related agreements and documents as he deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the agreement contemplated in Exhibit A and this Ordinance.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of _______________, 2007, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _______________, 2007.

 III. GUARANTY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF THE CITY AND REPAYMENT BY THE AUTHORITY

 3.1 Payment Obligations. The City unconditionally obligates itself to make payments to the Depository for deposit into the Interest Subaccount, Principal Subaccount and/or Debt Service Reserve Subaccount as provided in Section 3.2 below, in amounts sufficient, together with other funds available therefor, to make scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds. The City covenants and agrees, for so long as any Bonds are Outstanding, that each year it will include in its budget and levy an ad valorem tax within and as a part of the tax levy permitted to cities without a vote of the people, upon all the property within the City subject to taxation, which will be sufficient, together with all other money of the City that may legally be used and that the City may apply for such purposes, to satisfy its guaranty obligation to make payments with respect to the Bonds as provided herein. Registered owners of the Bonds are the express beneficiaries of the City's payment obligation set forth in this paragraph.

 3.2 Procedure in Event of Insufficient Funds.

 (a) In the event that the amount of funds in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount (taking into account earnings accrued thereon) falls below one-half (1/2) the Debt Service Reserve Requirement, the City shall, upon notice provided pursuant to the Depository Agreement given no later than the first Business Day of the second month preceding the next Debt Service Payment Date, cause to be deposited into the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount no later than seven (7) days prior to such Debt Service Payment Date, the amount of money necessary to restore the amount of funds in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount to one-half the Debt Service Reserve Requirement. The City shall deposit such funds directly with the Depository in accordance with the Depository Agreement.

 (b) If, for any reason by 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day preceding a Debt Service Payment Date the amount on hand in the Interest Subaccount, Principal Subaccount and the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount (taking into account earnings accrued thereon) is inadequate to make scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds on such Debt Service Payment Date, the Authority shall and the Depository (pursuant to the Depository Agreement) will immediately so notify the City. Upon such notice the City shall pay to the Depository the amount necessary to make up such deficiency no later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day preceding the scheduled Debt Service Payment Date.

 (c) Notwithstanding any failure by the Authority or the Depository to provide notice required under this Section 3.2, the City shall not be relieved of its payment obligations under this Section III, and shall make such payments upon receiving actual (and not merely constructive) notice of all facts set forth in this Section III that trigger the City's payments hereunder.

 3.3 Authority's Obligation to Repay the City.

 (a) Any amounts expended by the City pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed a loan from the City to the Authority. The Authority shall be obligated to repay such amounts from Revenues in accordance with Section 5.4 below, and, if the City so requires at the City's sole discretion, from all other property, assets or funds lawfully available to the Authority for such purpose including revenues, money and assets available to the Authority from sources or activities other than the Facility, with interest payable at an annual rate equal to the cost of funds to the City at the time of such expenditure or the annualized earnings rate of the City's general fund, whichever is greater.

 (b) The Authority shall repay the City any and all amounts expended by the City pursuant to this Agreement, together with interest as set forth above, within six (6) months after the City has expended such funds. The Authority's failure to repay the City within such time shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement.

 3.4 Tax Exemption.

 (a) Arbitrage Bonds. The City covenants that it will not make any use of the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds or any other money or obligations of the Authority or the City which may be deemed to be proceeds of such Bonds pursuant to Section 148(a) of the Code which will cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of said Section and said regulations. The City will comply with the applicable requirements of Section 148(a) of the Code throughout the term of the Bonds. The City covenants that it will not act or fail to act in a manner which will cause the Bonds to be considered obligations not described in Section 103(a) of the Code.

 (b) Private Activity Bonds. The City will take no actions and will make no use of the proceeds of the Bonds, or any other funds, that would cause any of the Bonds to be treated as a "private activity bond" (as defined in Section 141(b) of the Code) subject to treatment under said Section 141(b) as an obligation not described in subsection (a) of said Section 103, other than a "qualified 501(c)(3) bond" within the meaning of Section 145 of the Code, unless the tax exemption thereof is not affected.

 3.5 Non-Impairment. The Authority is relying on this Agreement and, in particular, on the unconditional obligations of the City provided for herein, to issue the Bonds. The City shall not take any action which impairs the Authority's authority to issue and sell the Bonds pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent legally required to prevent impairment of the City's obligations hereunder, the City shall reserve and designate for purposes of providing for the unconditional obligation of the City specified herein a portion of its general obligation debt capacity permitted to cities without a vote in accordance with Chapter 39.36 RCW, equal to the maximum principal amount of the Bonds, and, upon issuance thereof, such reservation may be reduced to equal the outstanding principal amount thereof.

 3.6 Undertaking to Provide Continuing Disclosure.

 (a) Disclosure. This Section 3.6 constitutes the City's written undertaking (the "Undertaking") for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds as required by United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") Rule 15c2-12, as it may be amended and administratively and judicially interpreted (the "Rule"). The City as an "obligated person" within the meaning of the Rule undertakes to provide or cause to be provided, either directly or through a designated agent:

 (b) City hereby undertakes (the "Undertaking") for the benefit of holders of the Bonds, as follows.

 Annual Financial Information. The City will provide or cause to be provided to each nationally recognized municipal securities information repository designated by the SEC in accordance with the Rule ("NRMSIR") and to a state information depository, if one is established in the State of Washington and recognized by the SEC (the "SID"), annual financial information and operating data of the type included in this Official Statement with respect to the City, as generally described below ("annual financial information"):

 (i) annual financial statements of the City, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to governmental units (except as otherwise noted therein), as such principles may be changed from time to time and as permitted by State law, which statements will not be audited, except that if and when audited financial statements are otherwise prepared and available to the City they will be provided;

In its provision of annual financial information, with respect to these obligations of the City, the City may cross-reference to any "final official statement" (as defined in the Rule) available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the "MSRB") or any other documents provided to each then existing NRMSIR or to the SID.

 The City will provide or cause to be provided to each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and to the SID, timely notice of a failure by the City to provide required annual financial information on or before the date specified above.

 Material Events. The City further will provide or cause to be provided to each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and to the SID, timely notice of the occurrence of any of the following events with respect to the Bonds, if applicable and material:

 (i) principal and interest payment delinquencies;

 For purposes of this section, "Continuing Disclosure Undertaking," the term "holders of the Bonds" shall have the meaning intended for such term under the Rule.

 To the extent authorized by the SEC, the City may satisfy its obligation to provide the information above by transmitting the required filings using http://www.disclosureusa.org (or such other centralized dissemination agent as may be approved by the SEC).

 (c) Amendment of Undertaking. The Undertaking is subject to amendment after the primary offering of the Bonds without the consent of any holder of any Bond, or any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, participating underwriter, rating agency, NRMSIR, the SID, or the MSRB, under the circumstances and in the manner permitted by the Rule.

 The City will give notice to each NRMSIR or the MSRB, and to the SID, of the substance (or provide a copy) of any amendment to the Undertaking and a brief statement of the reasons for the amendment. If the amendment changes the type of annual financial information to be provided, the annual financial information containing the amended information will include a narrative explanation of the effect of that change on the type of information to be provided.

 (d) Termination of Undertaking. The City's obligations under the Undertaking will terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption or payment in full of all of the then outstanding Bonds. In addition, the Undertaking, or any provision thereof, will be null and void if the City (i) obtains an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel or other counsel familiar with the federal securities laws to the effect that those portions of the Rule which require the Undertaking, or any such provision, are invalid, have been repealed retroactively or otherwise do not apply to the Bonds; and (ii) notifies the SID and either the MSRB or each then existing NRMSIR of such termination.

 (e) No failure by the City (or any other obligated person) to comply with the Undertaking will constitute a default with respect to the Bonds. The sole remedy of any holder of a Bond will be to take such actions as that holder deems necessary and appropriate to compel the City or other obligated person to comply with the Undertaking. The Undertaking will inure to the benefit of the City and any holder of the Bonds, and will not inure to the benefit of or create any rights in any other person.

 IV. [RESERVED]

 The Project Fund and each of its constituent accounts and subaccounts shall be held by the Depository pursuant to the Depository Agreement separate and apart from all other funds and accounts of the Authority, and shall be managed, invested, disbursed and administered as provided in this Agreement.

 5.4 Revenue Account and Application of Project Revenues.

 (a) For so long as the Bonds remain Outstanding, and unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the Authority shall deposit all Project Revenues into the Revenue Account. Payments under the Leases shall be deposited by the Authority into the Revenue Account upon receipt. Investment earnings on money in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount (in excess of the amount needed to maintain the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount at the Debt Service Reserve Requirement) shall be deposited into the Revenue Account when paid.

 (b) For so long as the Bonds are Outstanding, the money in the Revenue Account shall be used only for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:

 First, to make all payments required by this Agreement to be made into the Interest Subaccount to pay the interest on the Bonds;

 Second, to make all payments required by this Agreement to be made into the Principal Subaccount to pay the principal of the Bonds (including mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to term Bonds);

 Third, to make all payments required by this Agreement to be made into the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount;

 Fourth, to pay Operation and Maintenance Expenses;

 5.5 Bond Account. For so long as the Bonds are Outstanding the Authority shall maintain the Bond Account within the Project Fund. Within the Bond Account the Authority shall maintain the "Interest Subaccount", the "Principal Subaccount" and the "Debt Service Reserve Subaccount".

 (a) Interest Subaccount. For so long as the Bonds remain Outstanding, the Authority shall deposit into the Interest Subaccount on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month, from the Revenue Account or from any other revenues, funds and assets legally available to the Authority, one-sixth (1/6th) of the interest on the Bonds due and payable on the next debt Service Payment Date (adjusted for interest earnings and other money on deposit in the Interest Subaccount). The Authority shall also deposit money into the Interest Subaccount from the Revenue Account to the extent necessary to make up any deficiency in such Subaccount resulting from the failure to pay all or any portion of any prior monthly payment since the last Debt Service Payment Date. If there are insufficient funds in the Revenue Account to make up any such deficiency, the Authority shall make up such deficiency from any and all other revenues, money and assets legally available to the Authority from all sources including sources other than the Facility. The Authority shall authorize the Depository under the Depository Agreement to draw upon funds in the Interest Subaccount to make payments of the interest on the Bonds, and the Authority shall not draw upon funds in the Interest Subaccount for any other purpose until the principal of and interest on the Bonds is paid in full.

 (b) Principal Subaccount. Upon the issuance of the Bonds and for so long as the Bonds remain Outstanding, the Authority shall deposit into the Principal Subaccount on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month, from the Revenue Account or from any other revenues, funds and assets legally available to the Authority, and taking into account investment earnings on money in the Principal Subaccount (if any), one-twelfth (1/12th) of the principal on the Bonds due and payable on the next Debt Service Payment Date (whether such principal is due upon maturity of serial bonds or upon mandatory sinking fund redemptions of term Bonds) (provided, however, that if the first Debt Service Payment Date on which principal is due and payable on the Bonds is more than twelve (12) months after issuance of the Bonds, then monthly payments of principal hereunder shall commence the twelfth (12th) month preceding the first Debt Service Payment Date on which principal on the Bonds is due and payable). The Authority shall also deposit money into the Principal Subaccount from the Revenue Account to the extent necessary to make up any deficiency in such Subaccount resulting from the failure to pay all or any portion of any prior monthly payment since the last Debt Service Payment Date. If there are not sufficient funds in the Revenue Account to make up any such deficiency, the Authority shall make up such deficiency from any and all other revenues, money and assets legally available to the Authority from all sources including sources other than the Facility. The Authority shall authorize the Depository under the Depository Agreement to draw upon funds in the Principal Subaccount to make payments of the principal of the Bonds, and the Authority shall not draw upon funds in the Principal Subaccount for any other purpose until the principal of and interest on the Bonds is paid in full.

 (c) Debt Service Reserve Subaccount.

 (i) Establishment and Replenishment of Account. Upon the issuance of the Bonds the Authority shall deposit into the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount a portion of the proceeds of the Bonds in an amount equal to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement. For so long as the Bonds remain Outstanding, the Authority shall deposit into the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount, on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month, money from the Revenue Account in an amount sufficient, together with other funds in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount, to maintain the balance in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount in an amount equal to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement.

 (ii) Use of Funds. In the event that funds in the Interest Subaccount and/or Principal Subaccount are insufficient to make any payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds then due and payable, the Authority shall authorize the Depository under the Depository Agreement to withdraw funds from the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount to make such payment. The Authority shall not draw upon funds in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount for any other purpose until the principal of and interest on the Bonds is paid in full without the consent of the City, except that earnings from the investment of money in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount in excess of the amount needed to maintain the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount at the Debt Service Reserve Requirement shall be transferred to the Revenue Account pursuant to Section 5.8 below, "Investments and Earnings."

 (iii) Final Disposition of Funds. When the total remaining debt service on the Bonds is equal to or less than the amount in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount, and if at that time the City has been fully reimbursed for money expended, if any, under its guarantee obligations under this Agreement, then the money in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount shall be transferred to the Interest Subaccount and Principal Subaccount at such times and in such amounts as is necessary to make the final debt service payment(s) (or portion of such final debt service payment(s), as applicable) on the Bonds. If the City has not previously been fully reimbursed for any money expended to satisfy its guarantee obligations hereunder, then when no Bonds remain Outstanding, the balance in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount shall be used to repay the City for such expenditures; provided, however, that this sentence, and the existence of funds in the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount which may be used pursuant hereto to repay the City when no Bonds remain Outstanding, shall not abrogate or in any way affect or alter the Authority's obligation under Section 3.3, above, to repay the City within the time set forth therein, and making failure to do so an Event of Default under this Agreement. If any funds remain after repaying the City, then when no Bonds remain Outstanding such remaining funds shall be remitted to the Authority by the Depository.

 (iv) Notification to City of Withdrawal. The Authority shall notify the City within two Business Days of any withdrawal from the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount (other than the transfer of investment earnings into the Revenue Account as required under this Agreement).

 5.6 Capital Reserve Account.

For so long as the Bonds remain Outstanding, the Authority shall deposit into the Capital Reserve Account on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month a minimum of one-twelfth (1/12th) of the amount budgeted for Capital Reserves for that year in the Pro Forma Budget attached to this Agreement as Exhibit F.

 (b) Use of Money in Capital Reserve Account. The Authority may withdraw and use any and all funds in the Capital Reserve Account to pay for Capital Costs of the Facility. In the event that the expenditure of funds on a Capital Cost is necessary to operate the Facility consistently with prudent management practices, the Authority shall either spend money in the Capital Reserve Account for such Capital Cost or pay for such Capital Cost from funds available to it from sources other than the Facility. The Authority shall withdraw and use money in the Capital Reserve Account, if any, for the following purposes: (i) to repay the City, if the City so requests, for any money expended to satisfy its guaranty obligations under this Agreement; (ii) to replenish the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount, if the City so requests, up to the amount of the Debt Service Reserve Requirement; and (iii) to redeem the Bonds or pay debt service on refunding bonds or other refinancing pursuant to Section 5.19 below ("Refinancing").

 5.8 Investments and Earnings. The Authority may invest funds in the accounts and subaccounts established pursuant to this Agreement in such investments as the Authority is legally authorized to make, provided no such investment may adversely affect the exemption from federal income taxation under the Code of the interest on the Bonds. The investment earnings on the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount in excess of the amount needed to maintain the Debt Service Reserve Subaccount at the Debt Service Reserve Requirement shall be deposited into the Revenue Account. Investment earnings on money in all other accounts and subaccounts shall accrue to such accounts and subaccounts.

In no case shall the City's guaranty obligations under this Agreement be waived and no action required under this Section may in any manner whatsoever adversely affect the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Bonds. Taking action under this Section shall not be a condition to the City's exercise of its rights and remedies set forth in Section VI, "Events of Default and Remedies," and any action the City may take pursuant to this Paragraph shall not diminish or abrogate the City's rights and remedies under said Section VI.

 (c) Corrective Action Plan - Elements.

Grantor shall keep the Property free from liens and lien claims of all kinds, superior or inferior to the Deed of Trust, except such liens as may be approved by Beneficiary in writing.

Grantor shall not, without Beneficiary's prior written consent, change the general nature of the occupancy of the Property, initiate; acquire or permit any change in any public or private restrictions (including a zoning reclassification) limiting the uses which may be made of the Property, or take or permit any action which would impair the Property or Collateral or Beneficiary's lien or security interest in the Property or Collateral, all except as may be contemplated under the Guaranty Agreement. Grantor shall not, without the written consent of Beneficiary, (i) initiate or support any zoning reclassification of the Property, seek any variance under existing zoning ordinances applicable to the Property or use or permit the use of the Property in a manner which would result in such use becoming a nonconforming use under applicable zoning ordinances; (ii) modify, amend or supplement any easement, reservation, restriction, covenant, condition, or encumbrance pertaining to the Property; (iii) impose or consent to any restrictive covenant or encumbrance upon the Property, execute or file any subdivision or parcel map affecting the Property, or (iv) permit the Property to be used by the public or any person in such manner as might make possible a claim of adverse usage or possession or of any implied dedication or easement.

 13. Inspection of Property.

If Grantor fails to make any payment or do any act required under this Deed of Trust or the Guaranty Agreement, Beneficiary, without any obligation to do so, upon three days written notice (except in case of emergency) to Grantor and without releasing Grantor from any obligations hereunder or under the Guaranty Agreement, may make the payment or cause the act to be performed in such manner and to such extent as Beneficiary may deem necessary to protect the Property or Collateral or Beneficiary's interest therein. Beneficiary is authorized to enter upon the Property for such purposes. In exercising any of these powers Beneficiary may incur such reasonable expenses as it deems necessary.

 16. Sale or Transfer. If the Property or any portion thereof or interest therein is sold, conveyed, transferred, or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily (not including the creation of any Exception, but including any transfer upon the foreclosure thereof or default thereunder) without the prior written consent of the Beneficiary, then Beneficiary may declare all sums secured by the Deed of Trust immediately due and payable. Leases inconsistent with the terms of the Guaranty Agreement, leases with purchase options, conveyances by real estate contract and transfers by foreclosure or other forced sale or forfeiture shall each be deemed a transfer of Grantor's interest in the Property for the purposes of this paragraph. This provision shall apply to each and every sale, transfer, conveyance or encumbrance regardless of whether or not Beneficiary has consented or waived its rights, whether by action or inaction, in connection with any previous sale, transfer, conveyance or encumbrance, whether one or more.

 17. Insurance.

 (b) In the event of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust or other transfer of title to the Property in extinguishment of some or all of the indebtedness secured hereby, all interest of Grantor in any insurance policies pertaining to the Property or Collateral and in any claims against the policies and in any proceeds due under the policies shall pass to Beneficiary.

 (c) All insurance required under this paragraph shall be placed with companies legally entitled to do business in the state of Washington and placed with companies with a Best's rating of "A" or better and indicated to be of sufficient size to qualify for Best's designation VI. All proceeds Guaranty Agreement Deed of Trust to which Grantor may become entitled under any and all such insurance policies, either current or future, are hereby assigned to Beneficiary. All insurance required by Beneficiary shall be with lender's loss payable clauses in favor of and in form satisfactory to Beneficiary. The insurance certificates shall confirm that no insurance policy shall be canceled or modified without thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Beneficiary. At least thirty (30) days' prior to the expiration of the term of any insurance policy, Grantor shall furnish Beneficiary with written evidence of renewal or issuance of a satisfactory replacement policy. If requested, Grantor shall deliver copies of all policies to Beneficiary. All such policies shall be evaluated and adjusted as required by Beneficiary on an annual basis. Grantor shall provide Beneficiary with proof of premiums paid for each policy term so long as this Deed of Trust remains in effect. Grantor shall reimburse Beneficiary for any premiums paid for such insurance by the Beneficiary upon the Grantor's default in so insuring the improvements.

 18. Condemnation and Insurance Proceeds. Grantor shall give immediate notice to Beneficiary of any condemnation proceeding (including change of grade), or loss or damage to the Property or Collateral or any right therein. Such notice shall generally describe the nature and cause of such casualty and the extent of the damage to or destruction of the Property. Beneficiary may, except in the case of a condemnation by the Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's option, commence, appear in and prosecute, in its own name, any action or proceeding, make a claim for, or make any reasonable compromise or settlement as a result of condemnation, loss or damage. Subject to the terms of any deed of trust having priority over this Deed of Trust, all proceeds payable as a result of condemnation, loss or damage shall be paid to Beneficiary. All compensation, awards, damages, rights of action and proceeds, including the policies and the proceeds of any policies of insurance affecting the Property, are hereby assigned to Beneficiary, but no such assignments shall be effective to invalidate or impair any insurance policy. Subject to the terms of any deed of trust with priority over this Deed of Trust: (i) Grantor further assigns to Beneficiary any return premiums or other repayments upon any insurance at any time provided for the benefit of the Beneficiary and all refunds or rebates made of taxes or assessments on said Property, and (ii) Grantor agrees that Beneficiary may at any time collect said return premiums, repayments, refunds, and rebates in the event of any default by Grantor under the Loan Documents. No insurance proceeds or condemnation awarded at any time assigned to or held by Beneficiary shall be deemed to be held in trust, and Beneficiary may commingle such proceeds with its general assets and shall not be liable for the payment of any interest thereon. Beneficiary shall, unless Beneficiary determines that Beneficiary's security would be impaired or both Beneficiary and Grantor agree that the repair or restoration of the improvements on the Property would not be economically feasible, permit the proceeds to be used for repair and restoration of the Property on such conditions as Beneficiary may impose including evidence of sufficient funds to complete the work, approval of the plans and specifications and periodic disbursement of the proceeds during the course of repair and restoration. If (a) the Beneficiary determines that its security would be impaired by use of the proceeds for repair or restoration; (b) Grantor and Beneficiary agree that repair or restoration would not be economically feasible; (c) the conditions referenced in the previous sentence for use of proceeds for repair or restoration are not satisfied; or (d) Grantor fails to proceed with reasonable diligence to repair or restore notwithstanding the availability of insurance proceeds; then in any such case Beneficiary may, subject to the terms of any deed of trust having priority over this Deed of Trust, after deducting its expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees, without in any way affecting the enforceability or priority of the lien of this Deed of Trust or the obligation of the Grantor or any other person for payment of the Guaranty Agreement Deed of Trust indebtedness hereby secured or the reconstruction of the damaged improvements, whether such Grantor be the then owner of said Property or not

 (i) Apply all or part of the proceeds against the sums owed, if any, under the Guaranty Agreement, whether or not the sums are actually due; or

 (ii) Release all or any part of the proceeds to Grantor; or

 (iii) In the case of an Event of Default resulting from Grantor's failure to proceed with repair or restoration, cause the proceeds to be used for repair or restoration of the Property under the terms and conditions stated in Section 24 below.

 For purposes of this Section, impairment of the Beneficiary's security shall be determined by comparison to the adequacy of the Beneficiary's security prior to the condemnation or casualty loss. The provisions of this Section regarding the use and disposition of insurance and condemnation proceeds shall be subject to any requirements of Beneficiary contained in the Guaranty Agreement.

 19. Leases. Grantor shall fully comply with all of the terms, conditions and provisions of all Leases so that the same shall not become in default and do all that is necessary or advisable to preserve all said Leases in force. Except for real estate taxes and assessments, without the express written consent of Beneficiary, Grantor shall not permit any lien to be created against the Property which may be or may become prior to any Lease.

 20. Assignment of Rents and Leases - Grantor's Right to Collect. Grantor hereby absolutely and irrevocably assigns to Beneficiary all Grantor's interest in all rentals and deposits which may be received or contracted for under any existing or future leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all of the Grantor's present and future interests in said existing and future Leases, and, in the event of any default hereunder or under the Note, Grantor shall deliver possession of same to the Beneficiary forthwith upon demand. Unless otherwise provided in any separate assignment of leases and/or rents, and so long as Grantor is not in default under the Loan Documents, Grantor may collect the Rents as they become due. Grantor warrants that it has made no previous assignment of the Rents or Leases except as may be contained in the Exceptions, and will make no subsequent assignment without the prior written consent of Beneficiary. Grantor's right to collect the Rents shall not constitute Beneficiary's consent to the use of cash collateral in any bankruptcy proceeding.

 21. Beneficiary's Right to Collect Rents. If Grantor is in default under the Guaranty Agreement, Beneficiary or its agents, or a court-appointed receiver, may, upon reasonable notice to Grantor, collect the Rents. In doing so, Beneficiary may (a) evict lessees for nonpayment of rent, (b) terminate in any lawful manner any tenancy or occupancy, (c) lease the Property in the name of the then owner on such terms as it may deem best and (d) institute proceedings against any lessee for past due rent. Beneficiary's failure to collect or its discontinuing collection at any time shall not in any manner affect the subsequent enforcement by Beneficiary of its rights to collect the Rents. The collection of the Rents shall not cure or waive any default under the Guaranty Agreement. In exercising its rights under this section Beneficiary shall be liable only for the proper application of and accounting for the Rents collected by Beneficiary or its agents and for management of the Property after the assumption of such management duties by the Beneficiary. Any Rents paid to Guaranty Agreement Deed of Trust Beneficiary or a receiver shall be credited against the amount due from the lessee under the Lease. In the event any lessee under the Lease becomes the subject of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other federal, state or local statute which provides for the possible termination or rejection of the Leases assigned hereby, Grantor covenants and agrees that, in the event of sale or other transfer or conveyance, if any of the Leases are so rejected, no damages settlement shall be made without the prior written consent of Beneficiary; any check or instrument in payment of damages for rejection or termination of any such Lease will be made payable both to the Grantor and Beneficiary; and Grantor hereby assigns, subject to the terms of any recorded assignment of rents having priority over this Deed of Trust, any such payment to Beneficiary and further covenants and agrees that upon request of Beneficiary and subject to the terms of any recorded assignment of rents having priority over this Deed of Trust, it will duly endorse to the order of Beneficiary any such check or instrument. Beneficiary may apply the proceeds of any such check or instrument to any portion of the indebtedness secured hereunder in such manner as Beneficiary may elect.

 22. Additional Security Documents. Grantor shall within fifteen (15) days after request by Beneficiary execute and deliver any financing statement, renewal, affidavit, certificate, continuation statement, or other document Beneficiary may reasonably request in order to perfect, preserve, continue, extend, or maintain security interests or liens previously granted and the priority of the security interests or liens. Grantor shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection with the preparation, execution, recording, filing, and refiling of any such document.

 23. Financing Statement. This Deed of Trust shall serve as a financing statement filed for record in the real estate records as a fixture filing pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code.

 24. Default - Remedies. Any Event of Default under the Guaranty Agreement shall constitute a default hereunder, and Beneficiary shall not be required to provide Grantor the opportunity to cure any defaults except as specifically set forth therein or herein. Upon any Event of Default, Beneficiary may exercise its rights and remedies under the Guaranty Agreement and applicable law including foreclosure of this Deed of Trust judicially or non judicially by the Trustee pursuant to the power of sale and/or any remedies authorized under the Uniform Commercial Code. Beneficiary's exercise or failure to exercise any of its rights and remedies shall not constitute a waiver or cure of a default, nor shall any waiver of or failure to enforce any remedy upon any default constitute a waiver of any subsequent default. After an Event of Default hereunder the Beneficiary shall have the exclusive right to exercise any and all rights of Grantor pursuant to any contracts or agreements with respect to the construction of the improvements and with respect to any related plans, specifications, studies, data, and drawings, without liability to Grantor for any such exercise.

 25. Cumulative Remedies. All Beneficiary's and Trustee's rights and remedies specified herein and in the Guaranty Agreement are cumulative, not mutually exclusive and not in substitution for any rights or remedies available in law or equity. In order to obtain performance of Grantor's obligations under the Guaranty Agreement, without waiving its rights in the Property or Collateral, Beneficiary may proceed in such order and manner as Beneficiary may elect. The commencement of proceedings to enforce a particular remedy shall not preclude the discontinuance of the proceedings and/or the commencement of proceedings to enforce a different remedy.

 26. Sale of Property After Default. In the event of a Trustee's sale under this Deed of Trust, the Property and Collateral may be sold separately in one or more parcels or as a whole, at the option of Beneficiary. Neither Trustee nor Beneficiary shall be required to marshal Grantor's assets. In the event of a Trustee's sale of all the Property and Collateral, Beneficiary hereby assigns its security interest in the personal property Collateral to the Trustee. Beneficiary may also realize on the personal property Collateral in accordance with the remedies available under the Uniform Commercial Code or at law. In the event of a foreclosure sale, Grantor and the holders of any subordinate liens or security interests waive any equitable, statutory or other right they may have to require marshaling of assets or foreclosure in the inverse order of alienation.

 27. Appointment of Receiver. In the event of a default, Beneficiary shall be entitled after notice to Grantor as provided under appropriate court rules, and without bond, to the appointment of a receiver for the Property and Collateral.

 28. Foreclosure of Lessee's Rights - Subordination. Beneficiary shall have the right, at its option, to foreclose this Deed of Trust subject to the rights of any lessees of the Property. Beneficiary's failure to foreclose against any lessee shall not be asserted as a claim against Beneficiary or as a defense against any claim by Beneficiary in any action or proceeding. Beneficiary at any time may subordinate this Deed of Trust to any or all of the Leases except that Beneficiary shall retain its priority to any condemnation or insurance proceeds.

 29. Reconveyance After Payment. Upon written request of Beneficiary stating that all obligations secured by this Deed of Trust have been paid, Trustee shall reconvey, without warranty, the Property then subject to the lien of this Deed of Trust. The grantee in the reconveyance may be described as "the person or persons legally entitled thereto." Grantor shall pay any Trustee's fees or recording fees.

 30. Release of Parties or Collateral. Without affecting the Grantor's obligations under the Guaranty Agreement and without affecting the lien of this Deed of Trust and Beneficiary's security interest in the Property and Collateral, Beneficiary and/or Trustee may, without notice (a) release Grantor and/or any other party now or hereafter liable for any sums due under the Guaranty Agreement, (b) release all or any part of the Property or Collateral, (c) subordinate the lien of this Deed of Trust or Beneficiary's security interest in the Property or Collateral, (d) take and/or release any other security or guarantees for sums due under the Guaranty Agreement, (e) grant an extension of time, (f) modify, waive, forbear, delay or fail to enforce any obligations owed under the Guaranty Agreement, (g) sell or otherwise realize on any other security or guaranty prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to a sale of all or any part of the Property or Collateral, (h)  consent to the making of any map or plat of the Property, and (i) join in the grant of any easement on the Property. Any subordinate lienholder shall be subject to all such releases, extensions or modifications without notice to or consent from the subordinate lienholder. Grantor shall pay reasonable Trustee's attorneys', title insurance or recording fees in connection with release of Property or Collateral, the making of a map or plat or the grant of an easement.

 31. Nonwaiver of Terms and Conditions. Time is of the essence with respect to performance of the obligations due hereunder and under the Guaranty Agreement. Beneficiary's failure to require prompt enforcement of any required obligation shall not constitute a waiver of the obligation due or any subsequent required performance of the obligation.

 32. Waivers by Grantor. Without affecting any of Grantor's obligations under the Guaranty Agreement, Grantor waives the following:

 (a) Diligence, presentment, protest and notice of dishonor;

 (b) Any defense arising out of Beneficiary entering into additional financing or other arrangements with Grantor not relating to the Property and the Facility (as such term is defined in the Guaranty Agreement) and any action taken by Beneficiary in connection with any such financing or other arrangements or any pending financing or other arrangements not related to the Property or the Facility.

 33. Use of Property. The Property is not used principally, or at all, for agricultural or farming purposes.

 34. Maximum Interest Rate: Rate After Acceleration. If the amounts secured hereby shall be declared immediately due and payable after an Event of Default then all such amounts; including principal, interest, and premium (if any) shall thereafter bear interest at 12% per annum or the highest rate then permitted by applicable law, whichever shall be less.

 35. Substitution of Trustee. Beneficiary may at any time discharge the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee who shall have all of the powers of the original Trustee.

 36. Notices. Any notice given by Grantor, Trustee or Beneficiary shall be in writing and shall be effective (1) on personal delivery to the party receiving the notice or (2) on the third day after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid with return receipt requested, addressed to the party at the address set forth above.

 37. Successors and Assigns. This Deed of Trust shall be binding on Grantor and Grantor's heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Trustee and Beneficiary and their respective successor and assigns. The terms "Grantor," "Trustee" and "Beneficiary" include their successors and assigns.

 38. Controlling Document. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Deed of Trust and the terms and conditions of any other of the Guaranty Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Guaranty Agreement shall prevail.

 39. Invalidity of Terms and Conditions. If any term or condition of this Deed of Trust is found to be invalid, the invalidity shall not affect any other term or condition of the Deed of Trust and the Deed of Trust shall be construed as if not containing the invalid term or condition.

 40. Rules of Construction. This Deed of Trust shall be construed so that, whenever applicable, the use of the singular shall include the plural, the use of the plural shall include the singular, and the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders and shall include corporations, Guaranty Agreement Deed of Trust partnerships and limited partnerships. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement unless the context otherwise clearly requires.

 41. Section Headings. The headings to the various sections have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be used to construe this Deed of Trust.

 42. FIRPTA Certification. For loans secured by U.S. real property the I.R.S. requires lenders to obtain a certification of U.S. or foreign status from the property owners. If Grantor is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation or other foreign entity, Lender may be obligated to withhold funds in the event of a foreclosure. In general, the amount withheld would be 10% of the amount realized on the transfer. If this certification is not completed, the IRS will consider you to be foreign, and therefore subject to potential withholding under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act ("FIRPTA").
