 LETTER OF AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN

 CITY OF SEATTLE

 DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

 AND

 INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF

 PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL ENGINEERS, LOCAL 17

 The City and I.F.P.T.E, Local 17 have agreed to the following terms in the matter of the Permit Technician reclassification initiated by the Department of Planning and Development:

 1. Recognition

 The City recognizes Local 17 as the exclusive bargaining representative for all regular/probationary full-time, part-time or temporary employees in the title of the Permit Technician Entry, as the duties being specified to this new title are currently performed by Local 17 members. This title will be accreted to Local 17's Technical Unit.

 2. Retroactive Wages

 Employees who performed work in the Permit Technician or Permit Technician, Senior job classification will receive retroactive wages as follows:

 a. The Permit Technician classification will receive an 8% increase in pay, effective retroactively to May 7, 2003.

 b. The Permit Technician, Senior classification will receive a 6% increase in pay, effective retroactively to May 7, 2003.

 Retroactive pay will accrue from the effective date or the date of hire into a Permit Technician series position, whichever is later. As part of the agreement, the May 7, 2003 date will represent a "firewall," meaning that no appeals for an earlier effective date will be entertained.

 Retroactive pay determination for members of the Permit Technician Series who may be reclassified by Classification/Compensation to the newly created Permit Specialist I classification will be held in abeyance until negotiations on that series are complete. The same holds true for retroactive pay for any work performed by members in the Permit Technician Series that is determined to have been out of class at the newly created Permit Specialist (PS I) level.

 It is further agreed certain incumbents will be requested to begin performing PS I level work prior to completion of bargaining on the Permit Specialist series. The City agrees to retroactively compensate those incumbents at the negotiated rate of pay for the PS I classification effective from the date the PS I work actually begins.

 3. New Wages

 The following lists the new 2006 salary ranges:

 a. Permit Technician, Entry

 Former Salary Range: N/A

 New Salary Range Salary Range: 22.5B ($17.99 - $20.12)

 The current collective bargaining agreement, Article 9.9.G will apply to employees entering the Permit Technician, Entry classification.

 b. Permit Technician

 Former Salary Range: 24.5A ($18.64 - $21.69)

 New Salary Range: 26.5A ($20.12 - $23.41)

 c. Permit Technician, Senior

 Former Salary Range: 27.0A ($20.47 -$23.84)

 New Salary Range: 28.5A ($21.69 - $25.24)

 Salary range tables for the step progression of these titles for 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 are attached to this agreement.

 4. Seniority

 For purposes of layoff, service credit for the incumbent in the position that has been reclassified, shall include all service credit in the former title prior to the reclassification into one of the new titles.

 5. Promotion Within 12 Months

 Some positions will be requested to be reclassified to a higher classification such as the Permit Technician, Senior or Permit Specialist level. These positions will be under-filled at a lower level. The City and Local 17 agree that the incumbents in these positions will continue training and will be eligible for promotion to the higher classification, without competitive process, once training is satisfactorily completed, if this occurs within one year of the effective date of the Classification/Compensation Determination Reports. The waiving of the advertisement requirement as set forth in Article 10 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement is a one-time non-precedent agreement.

 If the incumbent is unable to meet training objectives at the end of one year, they will remain at the underfilled level. Incumbents who do not satisfactorily complete training within one year must go through the normal competitive processes to apply for any higher level job. The City and Local 17 further agree that incumbents who successfully complete training for this project, and are subsequently promoted to the next level, will have a six month trial service. This exception to the 12-month trial service provision is a one-time non-precedent agreement.
