 AN ORDINANCE creating an electric utility executive compensation program for the City Light Department; adding a new section to Chapter 4.20 of the Seattle Municipal Code; amending Section 4.13.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and authorizing the designation of exempt positions for participation in the program; all by a 2/3 vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City requires competitive compensation in order to recruit, retain and motivate effective executives, managers and policy experts; and

 WHEREAS, City Light competes for talent in the highly competitive electric utility market; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council commissioned a study on City Light operations which recommended there be a stronger compensation program to attract the necessary talent to guide improvement of the electrical utility; and

 WHEREAS, the reorganization phase of the Transforming City Light initiative will result in some City Light positions being redesigned to be similar to comparable positions in other electric utilities both public and private; and

 WHEREAS, a compensation consultant's study commissioned by Seattle City Light has shown that the City's existing pay bands may in some specific cases be too low to recruit or retain employees in the electric utility market;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new section is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 4.20.401 Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program

 There is hereby established a discretionary pay program to be known as the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program to be used exclusively for executive positions working in the electric utility department, Seattle City Light.

 A. Base Pay: The Electric Utility Executive pay band is hereby established as overlapping pay zones as follows:

 Position title Pay Zone (hourly equivalent) Electric Utility Executive 3, Officer $66.09 - $105.36 Electric Utility Executive 3, Director $57.66 - $92.24 (not Officer level) Electric Utility Executive 2 $44.21 - $70.74 Electric Utility Executive 1 $38.45 - $61.52

 B. Designation of Positions in Program: Each position included in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program shall be exempt from the classified service pursuant to Article XVI, Section 3 of the Charter of the City of Seattle. The Personnel Director shall receive requests for inclusion of positions in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program from the City Light Superintendent ("the Superintendent") and forward the recommendations to an Electric Utility Executive compensation committee that is composed of the Personnel Director, the Director of Finance, and a designee of the Mayor. From those positions recommended by the Superintendent, this compensation committee shall from time to time designate positions specific to the electric utility that shall thereafter be included in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program because these positions require higher pay opportunities to be competitive in the markets where City Light competes for experienced executives. For each of these designated positions, the compensation committee shall determine, from the list in subsection A, the title and the associated pay zone to which that position shall be assigned. At no time may more than fifteen (15) positions be included in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program. The City Light Department is authorized to use the titles in this program only for the positions in the City Light Department that have been assigned those titles by the compensation committee. Authorization is not transferable to another position and cannot be used in another department.

 C. Individual Pay Authorization: The Superintendent shall have the discretion to pay each of the employees appointed to positions in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program a salary within the pay zone to which the employee's position was assigned. The Superintendent may petition the Mayor or the Electric Utility Executive compensation committee for authorization to pay an employee whose position is in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program a salary that is authorized in an alternate, higher pay zone within this program, and the Mayor and the Electric Utility Executive compensation committee are each authorized to approve, deny or modify each petition he, she, or they receive, within the parameters of the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program Plan Document. Subsequent increases or other modifications to the salary of an employee who is being paid in an alternate pay zone shall be in accordance with the Program Plan document.

 D. Plan Document: The Personnel Director is authorized to develop and publish guidelines and a plan document to support administration of this Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program.

 E. Program Maintenance/No Cost of Living Adjustments: The Personnel Director shall review the pay zones at least every two years and recommend to the City Council any pay zone adjustments the Director deems appropriate. The titles and position incumbents assigned to titles in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program are not eligible for cost of living adjustments that may be granted to other non-represented positions and employees.

 F. Relocation Expenses: Should the reimbursement of relocation costs be necessary to successfully recruit an individual for a position within the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program, the City Light Department is authorized to pay, from funds accumulating in the budget of the City Light Department, reasonable and documented costs associated therewith in amount equal to two times that authorized from time to time pursuant to S.M.C. 4.14.150A. Should the employee terminate employment before completion of twelve months of service, or if the City terminates employment for cause, the relocation expenses shall be reimbursed by the employee as specified in S.M.C. 4.14.150C.

 G. Incentive Program: For employees in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program, a lump sum payment, in addition to base salary, may be awarded on an annual basis for recognition of the accomplishment of goals and work outcomes at the completion of the annual evaluation period. Any lump sum payment made pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a part of regular compensation for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and calculating retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the Seattle City Employees Retirement System. No awards or payments may be made under this program until City Light has submitted an Incentive Pay Program Plan proposal that includes associated performance measures and has received Council authorization by ordinance for implementation of this Plan.

 Section 2. The Superintendent of City Light is hereby authorized to use unexpended and unencumbered funds accumulating in his budget to pay the compensation authorized herein.

 Section 3. Subsection 4 of Section 4.13.010 of the Settle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 4.13.010 Exemptions from the Civil Service and Public Safety Civil Service Systems.

 In addition to those positions exempted by statute, City Charter, or other ordinance provision (elected officers, officers appointed pursuant to the City Charter, assistant City attorneys, heads of employing units, members of boards and commissions established by the City Charter, members of boards and commissions established by ordinance, positions excluded from the Public Safety Civil Service System pursuant to SMC Section 4.08.060, system-wide exemptions provided for in SMC Section 4.13.020, and library employees), the positions of City employment listed in the subsections of this section requiring a particularly high degree of professional responsiveness and individual accountability, or requiring a confidential or fiduciary relationship with the appointing authority, or being judicial positions requiring insulation as a third branch of government, are hereby declared to be exempt from the Seattle Municipal Code Chapters 4.04, 4.08, and the rules of City Personnel, the Civil Service Commission, and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission regarding examination, selection, discipline, termination, and appeals.
