 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the application of the City's Code of Ethics to firefighters at the Skagit Project; creating limited exceptions to allow those firefighters to supervise members of their families; amending Section 4.16.070 of the Seattle Municipal Code and adding a new section to Chapter 4.16 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light's Skagit facility is located in a remote area, populated almost exclusively by City Light employees and their families; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light workers at the Skagit project long ago established a volunteer fire department to respond to emergencies in the vicinity of City Light's Skagit facility, performing a service that is wholly unrelated to their duties as City Light employees; and

 WHEREAS, City Light employees, and in some cases their family members, serve as members of the volunteer fire department, which presently has 11 firefighters; and

 WHEREAS, the firefighters are paid by the City for their work as firefighters, and are subject to Chapter 4.16 of the Seattle Municipal Code (the "Code of Ethics") when serving as firefighters; and

 WHEREAS, City employees supervising their family members violates the City's Ethics Code; and

 WHEREAS, extraordinary relief is appropriate in this case, because applying the Ethics Code to these City employees performing non- traditional services far outside the city limits of Seattle could pose a threat to public safety;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 b. Have a financial or other private interest, direct or indirect, personally or through a member of his or her immediate family, in any matter upon which the officer or employee is required to act in the discharge of his or her official duties, and fail to disqualify himself or herself from acting or participating, except as permitted by Section 4.16.071;

 c. Fail to disqualify himself or herself from acting on any transaction which involves the City and any person who is, or at any time within the preceding twelve (12) month period has been a private client of his or hers, or of his or her firm or partnership;

 d. Have a financial or other private interest, direct or indirect, personally or through a member of his or her immediate family, in any contract or transaction to which the City or any City agency may be a party, and fails to disclose such interest to the appropriate City authority prior to the formation of the contract or the time the City or City agency enters into the transaction; provided, that this paragraph shall not apply to any contract awarded through the public bid process in accordance with applicable law.

 2. Improper Use Of Official Position.

 c.
