 AN ORDINANCE relating to street and sidewalk use; amending the Street Use Permit Fee Schedule to adopt an amended schedule of fees for permits for the use of public places such as streets and sidewalks; and authorizing the Director of Transportation to collect such fees in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.04.

 WHEREAS, Section 15.04.074 of the Seattle Municipal Code authorizes and directs the Director of Transportation to prepare and recommend to the City Council, for adoption by ordinance, a schedule of fees applicable to all street and/or sidewalk use permits (hereinafter referred to as the Street Use Permit Fee Schedule), commensurate with the cost of administration, review, inspection, and policing involved in the issuance and continuance of such permits and the use thereby granted; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate that those wishing to use the public right of way should bear the costs associated with obtaining the appropriate Street Use permits, and

 WHEREAS, Street Use permit fees were last adjusted during the 2004-05 budget cycle to begin recovering the department's cost of service without General Fund and to fund the Right-of-Way Management Initiative and franchise utility map conversion project; and

 WHEREAS, the existing permit issuance fee includes one-half hour for issuance and one-half hour for inspection although it is known that permit issuance requires three-quarters of an hour on average; and

 WHEREAS, implementation of a new Hansen permitting system, as currently being used by other divisions of SDOT and DPD, took place in January 2006 and requires administrative changes to existing permit fee types and uses; and

 WHEREAS, these administrative changes do not change the amount of permit fees, but substantially alter the appearance of the existing Street Use Permit Fee Schedule, making it impractical to include an existing schedule reflecting proposed changes; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120993, as last amended by Ordinance 121925, adopted a Street Use Permit Fee Schedule; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Transportation has prepared and recommended a replacement Street Use Permit Fee Schedule; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Street Use Permit Fee Schedule adopted by Ordinance 121925 is repealed and replaced by that attached as Exhibit A, which is hereby adopted effective January 1, 2007.

 Section 2. The Director of Transportation is authorized to collect such fees in accordance with Chapter 15.04 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2006, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2006.
