This project consists of the acquisition of a significant 23.9- acre inholding in Seattle's Discovery Park, a park of regional significance. The project is located in the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle, known as the Capehart housing tract site. It will be used as passive-use open space.

 2007: $1,300,000 in Conservation Futures Funds is allocated to this project.

315430 Morgan Junction Urban Village Park

This project consists of the acquisition of approximately .2 acres of land on California Avenue Southwest at Fauntleroy Avenue in the West Seattle neighborhood of Morgan Junction. The goal of the project is to establish a small community green space in the hub of this urban center.

315431 NE Queen Anne Greenspace Additions

This is a multiple-parcel open space acquisition project within the Northeast Queen Anne Green Space, located between Taylor Avenue North and Aurora Avenue North in Queen Anne. The first priority for acquisition is four parcels totaling .27 acres adjacent to Maclean Park.

315432 St. Marks Greenspace Additions

This is a multiple-parcel open space acquisition project that will help preserve a neighborhood greenbelt and will enhance the East Blaine public stairway, which is part of the Capitol Hill to Lake Union Trail and the I-5 Colonnade Park. The walkway has views of Lake Union, the Seattle Space Needle and the Olympic Mountains. The first priorities for acquisition are four parcels totaling .44-acres, on Harvard Avenue.

315433 Thornton Creek Park 2 Additions

This is a one-acre, two-parcel open space acquisition project on Thornton Creek at Northeast 100th Street and 20th Avenue Northeast in Northeast Seattle. These two parcels contain small houses that will be removed. The goal of the project is to help repair riparian habitat and functions on Thornton Creek to continue a community trail and greenbelt.

315417 Kubota Garden Natural Area

Located off Renton Avenue South in the Rainier Beach Neighborhood, this project consists of two wooded inholding parcels totaling 5.6 acres that buffer Kubota Gardens. The gardens are a Seattle landmark with local and international cultural significance. The additions also provide additional urban wildlife habitat. The city plans a passive nature trail in this buffer and the project will also help protect the headwaters of Mapes Creek.

 2007: $200,000 in Conservation Futures Funds is allocated to this project, with a first priority for acquisition of 1.3 acres located on Renton Avenue South near South 52nd Avenue, on the northern side of the Garden, to help buffer the garden from encroaching development. Conservation Futures funds previously allocated to this project by Ordinance 14797 may also be expended on the 1.3 acres near South 52nd Avenue, if such funds are needed.

315421 Sylvan Way Open Space

This project is a 3.4-acre wooded open space between Sylvan Way SW and SW Othello Street, at 27th Avenue SW, in the Delridge neighborhood. This project will provide additional urban wildlife habitat.

 2007: The Sylvan Way Open Space acquisition project is expanded to include two additional wooded parcels between Sylvan Way SW and SW Othello Street, at 27th Avenue SW, to achieve added habitat protection of the Longfellow Creek watershed.
