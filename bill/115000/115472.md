 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2006 Adopted Budget, removing a restriction that prevents the Department of Parks and Recreation's spending on the Gas Works Park Utility Improvements Project.

 WHEREAS, when appropriating money for the Department of Parks and Recreation's Parks Infrastructure Budget Control Level in the 2006 budget, the City Council provided that none of that money could be spent to pay for Gas Works Park Utility Improvements (Project #K731294) without a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, as requested by the City Council, the Department of Parks and Recreation provided a proposal in the form of a letter of intent between the Department and One Reel, the concerts' organizer, to hold the Summer Nights Concerts at Gas Works Park; and

 WHEREAS, utility and infrastructure upgrades are necessary to enable the staging of concerts and other events at Gas Works Park; and

 WHEREAS, spending on the Gas Works Park Utility Improvements Project is needed to begin construction; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The restriction imposed by the following budget proviso is removed:

 Department Green Sheet # Proviso Description Project ID

 Parks and #73-1-A-3 Prohibits spending K731294 Recreation of a 2006 appropriation (Parks Infrastructure Budget Control Level)

 Section 2. The City Council is eliminating the budget proviso described in Section 1 to allow spending of funds for utility and infrastructure upgrades at Gas Works Park based on the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation's stated intent to convene a community advisory group to provide input on methods to address traffic and parking, noise, and park access and other issues related to Summer Nights Concerts that will be held at Gas Works Park starting in the summer of 2006. The Council understands that the Superintendent, after seeking input from the community, will enter into a formal agreement with One Reel that describes the mitigation efforts that will be undertaken to address these issues. The Council expects that the formal agreement with One Reel will describe, among other things:

 a. How the concert promoters will ensure that sound levels are mitigated;

 b. How traffic will be managed within one mile of the concert site so as to minimize its impact on the community and how the use of public transportation by concert attendees will be maximized;

 c. How parking within one-half mile of the concert site will be managed so adequate parking remains for use by business and residential users during the period of the concerts;

 d. How any wear and tear or damage to the grounds of the concert site or equipment and structures at the concert site will be restored at the end of the concert season;

 e. What enhancements can be made to the park where the concert is held to ameliorate the presence in the park of equipment and structures related to the concerts on days between concerts and by exclusion from portions of the park on concert days; and

 f. How the existing hazardous waste remediation will be protected during preparation for and during the concerts.

 It is expected that a proposed form of such an agreement will be drafted and provided to members of the Parks, Neighborhood and Education Committee and to community members for review and comment by March 1, 2006. In addition, the Council intends that the concert series be evaluated following the final 2006 Summer Nights Concert at Gas Works Park by the community advisory committee with input from the Citywide Special Events Committee. Recommendations about improving the management of the concert series shall be provided to the Parks, Neighborhood and Education Committee or its successor.

 Finally, it is Council's intent that the Summer Nights Concerts will be located at Gas Works Park on a temporary basis only with such concerts not held at this location after September 2008.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
