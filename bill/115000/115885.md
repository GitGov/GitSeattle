King Street Station Multimodal Terminal

 BCL/Program Name: Mobility-Capital BCL/Program Code: 19003

 Project Type: Rehabilitation or Restoration Start Date: 2nd Quarter ~~2008~~2007

 Project ID: TC366810 End Date: 4th Quarter ~~2012~~2010

 Location: ~~Citywide~~303 S Jackson St

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A

 Neighborhood District: Downtown Urban Village: International District

 This project transforms the King Street Station into a transportation hub connecting express bus, commuter train, and light rail service. The City is negotiating with Burlington Northern Santa Fe to assume ownership of the station. The City expects to partner with the Washington State Department of Transportation to complete the restoration of the building so that it can be used for revenue producing activities such as offices, retail, and restaurants. The second phase of improvements converts the station to a multimodal hub by constructing street improvements and other improvements that make the station more accessible for transit and inter-city buses. ~~Funding~~~~is provided as part of the Bridging the Gap funding package.~~This project will receive $10 million of bond funds from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package, a portion of which has been identified as an interfund loan to fund the project design through 2007.

Mercer Corridor Project

 BCL/Program Name: Major Projects BCL/Program Code: 19002

 Project Type: New Facility Start Date: 1st Quarter 1999

 Project ID: TC365500 End Date: 4th Quarter 2010

 Location: Mercer/Fairview/Dexter Ave

 Neighborhood Plan: South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan Matrix: Multiple

 Neighborhood District: Lake Union Urban Village: In more than one Urban Village

 This project implements a comprehensive package of transportation improvements in the Mercer Corridor in South Lake Union. The project aims to use existing street capacity more efficiently and enhance all modes of travel, including pedestrian mobility. The project makes improvements in the Mercer/Valley Corridor, including a widened two-way Mercer St., to improve east- west traffic flow, improved pedestrian safety and access to South Lake Union Park, and enhanced neighborhood circulation for all modes. The "To Be Determined" funding source shown for this project represents revenues from a possible Regional Transportation Investment District, potential developer mitigation, and other grant sources that the Department plans to pursue. Councilmanic debt was issued in 2005 to provide capital funds for the federal and state environmental review, whose debt service will be paid by the beneficiaries of the original 2002 bond defeasance plan. This project was displayed as South Lake Union Transportation Improvements project in previous CIPs.

 During the 2005 budget process, $612,000 was added in bond funds to complete the environmental review. This funding is in addition to the $1.3 million added in 2004 for the environmental review in the form of an interfund loan (cash advance) in anticipation of a bond sale in 2005. In November 2007, a public vote is expected on the Regional Transportation

 Improvement District funding package that is anticipated to include dollars for this project. The right-of-way cost estimates for this project represent the net difference between the value of property needed for the project and the value of surplus right-of-way that would be made available as a result of the project. In the  2007 Adopted CIP, the project includes $30.0 million of bonds that are part of the "Bridging the Gap" funding package. In 2004, the City Council adopted a proviso limiting spending to $163,000 beyond carrover from 2003 until authorized by future ordinance after approval of a set of alternatives to be considered in an environmental review. The City Council lifted the proviso (Ordinance 121634) and directed SDOT to complete environmental review on the two-way Mercer alternative in November 2004. In 2005, Ordinance 121882 appropriated $361,000 in REET II funds to restore funding that was made available to complete a property acquisition related to this project. This supplemental appropriation is reflected in the fund table on the following page. This project will receive $30 million of bond funds from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package, a portion of which has been identified as an interfund loan to fund the project design and right-of-way work through 2007.

S Lander St. Grade Separation

 BCL/Program Name: Mobility-Capital BCL/Program Code: 19003

 Location: S Lander St./1st Ave. S/4th Ave. S

 Neighborhood Plan: Duwamish Neighborhood Plan Matrix: TP-2

 Neighborhood District: Greater Duwamish Urban Village: Not in an Urban Village

 This project develops a grade separation of the Lander St. roadway and the Burlington Northern mainline railroad tracks

 between 1st Ave. S near the Starbucks Center and 4th Ave. S. Previously, City staff evaluated traffic conditions and

 identified an initial design concept. During the preliminary engineering phase of the project, a consultant conducted a Type,

 Size and Location study to develop more detailed plans and cost estimates. Due to the failure of Referendum 51 in the

 November 2002 election, this project was put on hold until funds ~~are~~were identified. In late November 2006, the design phase of the project re-commenced, and in January 2007, survey, geotechnical and scoping of the design work began. This project will receive $20 million of bond funds from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package, a portion of which has been identified as an interfund loan to fund the project design and right-of-way work through 2007. ~~This project will receive $20 million of bond funds from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.~~~~

Spokane St. Viaduct

 BCL/Program Name: Major Projects BCL/Program Code: 19002

 Project Type: Improved Facility Start Date: 2nd Quarter 1994

 Project ID: TC364800 End Date: 3rd Quarter 20010~~2012~~

 Location: S Spokane St./6th Ave. S - I5 NB Rp/E Marginal Wy. S

 Neighborhood Plan: Morgan Junction (MOCA) Neighborhood Plan Matrix: Multiple

 Neighborhood District: In more than one District Urban Village: Duwamish

 This project improves the safety of the Spokane Street Viaduct by building a new structure parallel and connected to the

 existing one, widening the existing viaduct by about 41 feet. This allows for the addition of shoulders, a wider, permanent median, and a westbound ~~"weave-lane"~~'exit-entrance'-lane . In conjunction with the relocation of the on- and off- ramps from 4th to 1st Avenue South, these improvements will make it easier and safer for vehicles coming from I-5 to merge into the proper lane to exit the Spokane Viaduct. The project also adds~~includes~~an eastbound 4th Ave. off-ramp to the Spokane Viaduct which will facilitate~~s~~ bus connections to the E-3 Busway and in conjunction with the widening,~~which~~ make~~s~~ it possible to stripe an eastbound transit only or HOV lane. The ramp will also greatly improve access to currently under-utilized 4th Avenue South for freight and general traffic. The project is likely to be constructed in a minimum of two phases. The 4th Ave. off-ramp is likely to be constructed first in 2008, followed by the widening phase in 2009 and 2010.~~The project is likely to be constructed in a minimum of two phases. Phase I constructs from east of 1st Avenue South west to the terminus at the Harbor Island off-ramps and will include construction of the new ramps at 1st Avenue S. Phase 2 extends the widened structure to the I-5 interchange, the eastern terminus of the project. The 4th Ave. off-ramp is either constructed as part of Phase 2, if funding allows, or as Phase 3 of the project.~~ In November 2007, a public vote is expected on the Regional Transportation Improvement District funding package, which is anticipated to include dollars for this project. ~~In 2007, the project will receive $30.0 million of bond funds from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package.~~This project will receive $30 million of bond funds from the "Bridging the Gap" funding package, a portion of which has been identified as an interfund loan to fund the project design and right-of-way work through 2007.
