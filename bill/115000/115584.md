 WHEREAS, the City Council appropriated an additional $2.5 million in the Seattle Department of Transportation's (SDOT's) Capital Projects Budget Control Level beyond what the Mayor had proposed in the 2006 budget; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, in appropriating the additional $2.5 million, provided that this amount may not be spent until authorized by future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has passed an Ordinance to modify the budget proviso to authorize that $500,000 be used for the S Jackson St. Improvements project (TC366000); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council desires to lift the budget proviso to permit SDOT to use the remainder of the appropriated funds; and

 WHEREAS, the Alaskan Way Seawall Interim Repairs Project, SDOT TCIP Project TC366670, the NE 98th Street Walkway Project, SDOT TCIP Project TC366710, the Burke-Gilman Trail Extension Project, SDOT TCIP Project TC364830, the Marked Crosswalk Project, SDOT TCIP Project TC366700, and the Phinney Ridge Air-Raid Siren Repainting Project, SDOT TCIP Project TC366720 are capital projects eligible for the use of REET funds; and

 WHEREAS, the recently completed analysis of the Alaskan Way Seawall reveals greater deterioration than anticipated due to marine-borer damage in some sections of the Seawall and repair should not wait until the full Viaduct replacement construction ; and

 WHEREAS, the interim repairs for the Seawall require $250,000 in City funds; and

 WHEREAS, the Northgate Coordinated Transportation Investment Plan (CTIP) technical analysis showed the highest traffic volumes of any local street in the Northgate area to be on NE 98th Street, and the CTIP recommends sidewalks on NE 98th Street from Lake City Way to 15th Avenue NE and funding constraints make it necessary to construct this project in phases; and

 WHEREAS, the NE 98th Street Walkway project requires $225,000 of City funds to complete design and construction of a walkway on the south side of 98th Street from Lake City Way to 20th Avenue NE; and

 WHEREAS, the Burke-Gilman Trail's preferred route was passed in 2003 by City Council in Resolution 30583, and the next step is to have the trail designed from 11th Avenue NW to 17th Avenue NW furthering the City's goal of completing the Burke-Gilman Trail to Golden Gardens Park; and

 WHEREAS, the Burke-Gilman Trail project requires $125,000 in City funds to match the State grant of $720,000 to complete a portion of the design of the Trail in the Ballard area; and

 WHEREAS, the City has identified uncontrolled (by traffic signals/signs) marked crosswalks on arterial streets that are reasonably safe but do not comply with national guidelines for promoting pedestrian safety, and SDOT has recommended that these should either be augmented by additional traffic safety devices or removed; and

 WHEREAS, $1,325,000 for the Marked Crosswalk project will allow SDOT to address additional marked crosswalks that are reasonably safe but not in compliance with national guidelines; and

 WHEREAS, lead-based paint has covered the rusty Phinney Ridge Air- Raid Siren since WWII, and sand-blasting and repainting are called for; and

 WHEREAS, the Phinney Ridge Air-Raid Siren Repainting project requires $75,000 to cover appropriate containment and disposal of existing lead-based paint and repainting of the siren; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Alaskan Way Seawall Interim Repairs

 BCL/Program Name: Capital Projects Management BCL/Program Code: DOT-CPM Project Type: Maintenance Start Date: 2nd Quarter 2006 Project ID: TC366670 End Date: 4th Quarter 2006

 Location: Alaskan Way from Madison St to Broad St Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A

 Neighborhood District: Downtown Urban Village: Commercial Core

 This project constructs repairs to the facing material of the Alaskan Way Seawall at locations along the central waterfront in the vicinity of Clay Street. Recent inspections have revealed significant damage to the Seawall facing from marine-borers leading to the loss of structural competence. The project will also install monitoring along the Seawall from Madison St to Broad St to allow SDOT to gather information on the extent of deterioration, and to monitor the risk of problems. The monitoring is the best possible means to provide warnings to allow SDOT time to apply further repairs if necessary. The project is intended to extend the life of the Seawall marginally, given the eventuality of replacement of a portion of the Seawall from S Washington to approximately Pine Street.
