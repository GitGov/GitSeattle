 INTERLOCAL AGREEMENT

 Between

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND KING COUNTY

 Relating to consideration of the South Park Bridge as a Condition

 Necessary for the Designation of the Unincorporated North Highline Area

 As a Potential Annexation Area by the City of Seattle

 THIS AGREEMENT, entered into under the authority of the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Chapter 39.34 RCW, between the City of Seattle, Washington, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("the City") and King County, a home rule charter county, a political subdivision of the State of Washington ("the County"), regarding designation of the unincorporated area in North Highline ("the Unincorporated North Highline Area"). The City and the County are referred to collectively as "the Parties."

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle is conducting studies regarding the feasibility of designating all or a portion of the Unincorporated North Highline Area as a Potential Annexation Area ("PAA"). See Exhibit A; and

 WHEREAS, On April 5, 2004, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30666, which, among other things, requires the City, prior to proceeding with designation of the Unincorporated North Highline Area as a Potential Annexation Area ("PAA"), to execute an interlocal agreement that: 1) protects the City from assuming financial responsibility for the existing South Park Bridge and for any work needed for its replacement or removal; 2) indemnifies the City against all liability associated with the existing South Park Bridge; and 3) requires the County to assume overall financial responsibility for the replacement of the existing South Park Bridge within a reasonable timeframe. The Council Resolution also stated that the City of Seattle would not annex the Unincorporated North Highline Area in any scenario if it became responsible for the existing South Park Bridge; and

 WHEREAS, King County has initiated the King County Annexation Initiative, which is designed to implement King County Countywide Planning Policies by encouraging the annexation of urbanized unincorporated areas to neighboring cities prior to 2012; and

 WHEREAS, The King County annexation initiative works to identify the steps necessary for each of the remaining urban unincorporated areas to move forward with annexation in a manner that best serves the long term interests of the unincorporated residents and that the course of action will likely be different for each urban unincorporated area given their inherent differences; and

 WHEREAS, King County considers the local governance choices and concerns of the Unincorporated North Highline Area as separate and distinct from those of the Unincorporated South Park Area and that resolution of issues interfering with annexation of one area should not adversely affect the other; and

 WHEREAS, King County supports the annexation of the Unincorporated South Park Area to the City of Seattle upon the replacement or removal of the existing South Park Bridge by King County; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle will not consider designating and annexing the Unincorporated South Park Area until King County has replaced or removed the existing South Park Bridge given that state law dictates that county roads systems become the responsibility of the annexing city upon annexation; and

 WHEREAS, The existing South Park Bridge, owned by King County and the City of Tukwila, is partially located within the Unincorporated South Park Area and partially located within the City of Tukwila and is a critical connection to the region's industrial area and a vital transportation link for cars, trucks, buses, bicyclists, and pedestrians across the Duwamish River; and

 WHEREAS, King County is committed to replacing the existing South Park Bridge, provided that sufficient funding is available through a regional dedicated transportation funding source, along with federal, state, and local sources and the existing South Park Bridge continues to be owned by King County and the City of Tukwila; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle has expressed concern that if it did designate all or a portion of the Unincorporated North Highline Area as a PAA and proceeded with an annexation process, that the Washington State Boundary Review Board for King County ("BRB) could add the Unincorporated South Park Area to the City's annexation proposal without the City's consent; and

 WHEREAS, King County is willing to work with the City of Seattle to reasonably address their concerns regarding the existing South Park Bridge so that the City may consider designating all or a portion of the Unincorporated North Highline Area; and

 WHEREAS, The BRB was created to review and approve, disapprove, or modify actions by a city, town or special purpose district that includes the creation, incorporation or change in the boundary of any city, town or special purpose district; and

 WHEREAS, In a letter dated September 20, 2006, the Special Assistant Attorney General assigned to the BRB, stated that he did not believe that it would be appropriate for a boundary review board to expand a proposed annexation by adding noncontiguous territory and further stated that such an expansion would violate the provisions of Chapter 35.13 RCW and that such an expansion would be inconsistent with the BRB's own Rules of Practice and Procedure (See Exhibit B); and

 WHEREAS, Under the King County Countywide Planning Policies (LU-32), to which the City has agreed, a city may only annex territory within its designated PAA; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle has not designated the Unincorporated South Park Area as a PAA and does not intend to consider designating the Unincorporated South Park Area as a PAA until King County replaces or removes the existing South Park Bridge; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle has not designated all or part of the North Highline Area as a PAA and does not intend to until it has assurances regarding King County's commitment to replacing the existing South Park Bridge within a reasonable timeframe; and

 WHEREAS, The Parties wish to enter into this interlocal agreement pursuant to Chapter 39.34 RCW.

 NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Chapter 39.34 RCW, the City and County hereby agree as follows:
