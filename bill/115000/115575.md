 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE granting Alley24 East LLC permission to construct, maintain and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across the alley in the block bordered by Pontius Avenue North and Yale Avenue North and John and Thomas Streets, for a ten-year term, renewable for two successive ten-year terms; specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted, and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 WHEREAS, Alley24 East LLC is developing the full City block bordered by Pontius and Yale Avenues and John and Thomas Streets, in which an alley is located mid-block; and

 WHEREAS, the skybridge will connect a mixed-use building consisting of offices and apartments on the eastern portion of the block to the roof of the historic Laundry Building located on the western half of the block; and

 WHEREAS, the skybridge will be located approximately mid-block across the alley and will have limited visibility from the streets bordering on the north and south, and will not be visible from the streets bordering on the east and west; and

 WHEREAS, the skybridge will connect the office building to the roof garden located on top of the existing Laundry Building, which is overlooked by offices and apartments; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 30800, the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, granted conceptual approval of the skybridge; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Chapter 15.64, Alley24 East LLC has submitted the information required for the Director of Transportation ("Director") to make a recommendation to the Council on whether to grant or deny conceptual approval, and the Director has circulated the information to the Seattle Design Commission, City departments, and public and private utilities interested in or affected by the proposed skybridge, and compiled the responses in C.F. 307441; and

 WHEREAS, the departments and utilities have no objections to the conceptual design of the skybridge; and

 WHEREAS, the Design Commission supports the skybridge as a core element of the development and recommends that the Council approve the final application; and

 WHEREAS, in making her recommendation, the Director considered the 12 elements set forth in SMC 15.64.050.B, and recommended that conceptual approval be granted; and

 WHEREAS, the adoption of this ordinance is the culmination of the approval process for the skybridge and will allow Alley24 East LLC to move forward with its construction; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to Alley24 East LLC, ("Permittee"), its successors and assigns, to maintain and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across the alley in the block bordered by Pontius Avenue North and Yale Avenue North and John and Thomas Streets, for a ten (10) year term, renewable for two successive ten- year terms; specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted, and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall be for a term of ten (10) years commencing 30 days after the Mayor's signature, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. ten years thereafter; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (60) days before expiration of the term, the Director may renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms, provided further that the total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City)" by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.

 Section 3. The permission is hereby subject to any protection, support, or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owner of the utility and shall be done at Permittee's expense with the Permittee being responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to the construction, repair, reconstruction, maintenance, or operation of said pedestrian skybridge.

 Section 4. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public of the street right-of-way for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove said pedestrian skybridge at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the pedestrian skybridge is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that said pedestrian bridge interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by the Permittee after notice of violation has been given by the City.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 5. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of said pedestrian skybridge pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination, or order of removal or, prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove," as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove said pedestrian skybridge and shall place all portions of the street that may have been disturbed for any part of said pedestrian skybridge, in as good condition for public use as it was prior to construction of said pedestrian skybridge, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. The Director shall then issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 6. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment, or repair of said pedestrian skybridge except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with, plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director in his/her judgment may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of said pedestrian skybridge at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of said pedestrian skybridge, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation, or repair of any and all municipally-owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 7. After notice to the Permittee, and failure of the Permittee to correct said unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order said pedestrian skybridge closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 8. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of said pedestrian skybridge, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 a) said pedestrian skybridge and all its equipment and property are removed from the street;

 b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and

 c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein.

 Provided that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove said pedestrian skybridge and its property, and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 9. Said pedestrian skybridge shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of the terms set forth in this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, releases the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with the City, to at all times protect and save harmless the City from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said pedestrian skybridge, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 a) the City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,

 b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns,

 this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 10. For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until said pedestrian skybridge is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1 or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 5 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which fully protect the City from any all claims and risks of any loss from perils which can be insured against under general liability insurance contracts and fire insurance contracts, including any extended coverage endorsements thereto which are customarily available from time to time, in conjunction with:

 a) construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use or existence of said pedestrian skybridge permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of said pedestrian skybridge;

 b) Permittee's activity upon, or the use or occupation of, the area described in Section 1 of this ordinance, and

 c) any and all claims and risks in connection with and activity performed by the Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance.

 Minimum insurance requirements shall be a policy of comprehensive commercial general liability of a form acceptable to the City. The City will require insurance coverage to be placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State, except that if it is infeasible to obtain such a policy, the City may approve an alternative company. Minimum policy limits shall be Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per occurrence and Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) annual aggregate each period. Coverage shall specifically name said pedestrian skybridge exposure. Liability coverage shall add by endorsement the City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insured's clause indicating essentially that "except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part to the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought". The City will not accept a certificate of insurance as evidence of current coverage.

 Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a photocopy of the insurance policy declaration page, indicating all endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect the City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Section 11. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work on the premises as contemplated by this permit, name the City as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to Permittee to the City as well.

 Section 12. Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance the Permittee shall deliver to the Director for filing with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond in the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington, conditioned that the Permittee will comply with each and every provision of this ordinance and with each and every order of the Director pursuant thereto; provided, that if the Mayor of the City in his/her judgment shall deem any bond or bonds filed to be insufficient and demand a new or additional bond, the Permittee shall furnish a new or additional bond in such amount as the Mayor may specify to be necessary to fully protect the City. Said bond shall remain in effect until such time as said pedestrian skybridge is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1, or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 5 of this ordinance.

 Section 13. The Permittee, its successors and assigns shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, consent of the City Council shall not be required for any transfer or assignment of the privileges conferred by this ordinance by way of mortgage, pledge or encumbrance or by way of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any mortgage, pledge or encumbrance. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 Section 14. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be justly chargeable by the City as costs of inspection of said pedestrian skybridge during construction, reconstruction, repair, annual structural inspections, and at other times deemed necessary to ensure the safety of said pedestrian skybridge, under the direction of the Director, as provided by Municipal Code Section 15.76. Permittee shall also promptly pay to the City in advance upon statements rendered by the Director an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of One Thousand One Hundred Forty-three Dollars ($1,143) beginning the effective date of this ordinance and annually thereafter. Adjustments to the annual fee amount shall be made in accordance with a term permit fee schedule adopted by the City Council by ordinance and may be adjusted every year. In the absence of such a schedule, the Director may only increase or decrease the previous year's fee amount annually to reflect any inflationary changes so as to charge said fee in constant dollar terms. This adjustment will be calculated by adjusting the previous year's fee amount by the percentage change between the two most recent year-end values available of the Consumer Price Index for the Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area, All Urban Consumers, All Products, and Not Seasonally Adjusted. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the Transportation Operating Fund.

 Section 15. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any (1) employee, (2) applicant for employment, or (3) person with respect to the award or referral of a contract or with respect to the conditions, terms, price or performance standards, or other provisions of a contract in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the construction, repair, or maintenance of said pedestrian skybridge permitted to be erected and/or operated pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, ancestry, age, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification. The Permittee shall:

 a) post in conspicuous places available to such employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non discrimination clause.

 b) insert in any contract for work undertaken in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the repair, construction, maintenance or operation of said pedestrian skybridge referenced in this ordinance language substantially similar to the language contained in this Section 15 and which requires any person or entity entering into such contract to comply with the non discrimination provisions of this Section.

 Section 16. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 17. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
