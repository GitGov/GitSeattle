 WHEREAS, the Sound Way Property is included within the recommended boundary of the West Duwamish Greenbelt included in Attachment B to Resolution 28653; and

 WHEREAS, community members expressed the desire to preserve the Sound Way Property as open space because of its location in the West Duwamish Greenbelt, its proximity to South Seattle Community College and the proposed Riverview trail, and the habitat value provided by the existing vegetative cover, wetlands, and steep slopes on portions of the site; and

 WHEREAS, Resolutions 30715 and 30793 supported, under certain conditions, City retention of the Sound Way Property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR"); and

 WHEREAS, upon receipt of funds from CTED, The Nature Consortium will pay no less than Four Hundred Ninety-four Thousand One Hundred Seventeen Dollars ($494,117) to the City; and

 WHEREAS, The Nature Consortium has also indicated its intent to continue its stewardship and restoration activities in the West Duwamish Greenbelt and to extend those activities to the Sound Way Property, using funds raised from the community and community volunteers; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to transfer the jurisdiction of the Sound Way Property from the Seattle Department of Transportation ("SDOT") to DPR for park boulevard purposes to promote the orderly and efficient management of the Sound Way Property and the adjoining City-owned property in the West Duwamish Greenbelt as open space, and to accept funds from The Nature Consortium for that purpose; NOW, THEREFORE,
