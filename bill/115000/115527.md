 Seattle Center

Monorail Improvements

 BCL/Program Name: Monorail Improvements BCL/Program Code: S9403

 Project Type: Rehabilitation or Restoration Start Date: Ongoing

 Project ID: S9403 End Date: Ongoing

 Location: Monorail Station Adjacent To Center House

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan N/A

 Neighborhood District: Magnolia/Queen Anne Urban Uptown

 This project funds renovation of the Monorail, which has historically been funded primarily with revenues from

 Federal Transit Administration (FTA) grants. The City operates the Monorail through its contractor, Seattle

 Monorail Services (SMS). In 2004, in accordance with an agreement with the City, SMS undertook major repairs and

 life/safety upgrades to the two Monorail trains in response to the May 2004 fire on the Blue Train. Both trains

 returned to passenger service in May 2005. SMS is financing the upfront cost of these repairs, which are estimated at

 $2.6 million. This initial investment will be paid back over time from Monorail system revenue and insurance proceeds. Remaining FTA grant revenue of $77,000 also contributed to funding the fire repair costs. In 2006, SMS is financing the upfront costs of repairs and safety improvements to the monorail trains as a result of a collision involving both trains in November 2005. The upfront cost, estimated at $3million, will be paid back over time from insurance proceeds and Monorail system revenues. FTA grant revenue of $602,000 with matching funds of $151,000 provided by SMS, also contributed to funding the costs of repairs and safety improvements after the November 2005 collision.
