Some of these activities describe how HUD Block Grant Funds will be used to support the Community Development Program of the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund.

 The following matrix summarizes the status of actions, outcomes and results as of 2006. Please refer to the full Southeast Seattle NRS document included as an attachment to the 2005 Consolidated Plan Update for more information.
